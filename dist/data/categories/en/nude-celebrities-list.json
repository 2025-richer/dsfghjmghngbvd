This girl can handle a BBC like a Blacked.com pornstar, and if you haven’t seen it yet, you’re truly missing out!</p><p>2. Break The Internet - In a magazine feature, Kim stripped down to reveal her big and bouncy booty drenched in baby oil while looking back at her fans with a naughty look in her eye. It was a masterpiece of erotic photography and wouldn’t look out of place on the cover of a porn movie.

I've sprayed many a nut to Marilyn over the years. There are few erotic spreads better than her red velvet pictures.</p><p></p><p>Marilyn Monroe's early life was marked by adversity and uncertainty. She was born to Gladys Pearl Baker, a film cutter, and never knew her biological father. Her mother struggled with mental health issues, and young Norma Jeane spent much of her early childhood in foster homes and orphanages.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>In the Stars</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Eventually, Marilyn married James Dougherty, a neighbor, to avoid another stint in foster care. This marriage, however, did not last long, as World War II separated them when James was deployed overseas.</p><p></p><p>Using sex as a tool would turn out to be a theme throughout Marilyn's life. It was a survival technique. I couldn't be more disappointed I wasn't around back then to help Marilyn survive with my dick. I call it the rod of life.</p><p></p><p>After World War II, Norma Jeane began working in a munitions factory, contributing to the war effort.

Eating an apple would just be the start. If she asked nicely, I would have stabbed God with a branch from the Tree of Knowledge.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>My Penis is a Girl's Best Friend</h3><p></p><p></p><p>How many diamonds do you want, Marilyn? I'll buy them all for you for a blow job.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Blowing Up Skirts</h3><p></p><p></p><p>I sure wish I was standing under that grate. I bet I would have a great view of her camel toe. I may even slide my penis through the slats and poke her in the asshole.</p><p></p><p>While Marilyn Monroe is often celebrated for her beauty, her acting talent should not be overlooked.

If you feel like giggling and cumming at the same time, rent this off of YouTube.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Personal Life</h3><p></p><p></p><p>I would never have let her go once Marilyn signed those marriage papers. I don't care how fucked up the bitch was. As long as Marilyn kept giving up the pussy, I'm sticking around. Don't worry, guys. I'd still cheat on her, but I wouldn't divorce her.</p><p></p><p>Despite her enormous success, Marilyn Monroe grappled with personal struggles, including anxiety, depression, and substance abuse. Her inner turmoil and the relentless media scrutiny took a toll on her mental health. She sought solace in therapy and even spent time in a psychiatric hospital.</p><p></p><p>I have the cure for Marilyn's depression and substance use inside of my pants.

Everybody's seen a Billie Elish Deepfake on Gabbie Carter's older videos. Are you surprised? They've got the same skinny frame and busty titties. But in a world where AI is running the show, why not get a bit imaginative? So, of course, you'll see edits of Billie in Blacked scenes, Bang Bros, and even Reality Kings, where they showcase Billie looking way too comfortable for paparazzi and photo ops if you catch my drift.</p><p></p><p>When it comes to her fashion, it's always been controversial, but it's always been evolving. She's got her signature draped oversized outfits, but she's also dazzled in more figure-hugging ensembles. Just check out those shots from her perfume promos, her dripping wet looks, or her appearances at places like the Met Gala. The girl's got some good goddamn curves, and she's flaunting them! Her workout snaps are a testament to how she's embracing her body. She loves taking selfies post-exercise, and with those lovely legs on display, you’ve got to give her props for staying consistent as a fitness enthusiast and giving us more sexy mirror selfies. Billie's also made some bold strides in magazines. Remember those sultry Vogue UK shots from 2021? The world was fucking shook. I remember seeing her and going, \"Damn, that's Billie Eilish?\"</p><p></p><p>Although I never doubted her talent, I didn’t know she had a body like that. Goddamn! Those fucking tits! From that point forward, it seemed like the baggy clothes were replaced by corsets, panties, and stockings. And let's not forget the Rolling Stone feature; they had her looking like she was about to be fucked in a Vixen scene, and we all know those bastards go all out in their shoots. Even her hair has changed from those neon roots to platinum jet black, and occasionally, she will go full blonde. While Billie continues to serenade us with her vocals, she's also serving up a busty buffet of sexiness every time we see her on the goddamn screen. She's showing the world that she's not just a musical prodigy but a full-fledged superstar who's surely not known by what she wears anymore. Hell, when do we get to the part where she wears nothing?</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Early Life &amp; Career</h3><p></p><p></p><p>It's fascinating thinking about how Billie transitioned from singing in her bedroom and dancing her heart out to global stardom. Her early life was a blend of raw talent, a nurturing environment, and perhaps a sprinkle of destiny. It's a reminder that, sometimes, the stars just align perfectly! There's no doubt she's hot, right? But if you doubt her musical talent, let the numbers speak for themselves: 49 wins and 79 nominations. Billie took home the Golden Oscar in 2022! The Academy Awards didn't shy away from giving her and her brother, Finneas O'Connell, the nod for 'Best Achievement in Music Written for Motion Pictures' for their track \"No Time to Die.\"</p><p></p><p>That alone is a fucking showstopper to be on a James Bond movie soundtrack, but Billie being Billie, there's more. In 2024, she caught the eyes of the Annie Awards, snatching a nomination for \"Turning Red,\" collaborating with the talented Ludwig Göransson and, of course, her ever-present brother, Finneas. The Brit Awards in 2022 was a treat: Billie earned 'International Artist of the Year' and a cheeky nomination for \"Happier Than Ever\" as 'International Song of the Year'. Continuing with her awards, she clinched the 'Best Song' at the Critics Choice Awards for \"No Time to Die\" in 2022, sharing the limelight again with Finneas. And speaking of the spotlight, she dazzled at the Golden Globes the same year, earning 'Best Original Song - Motion Picture' for that same haunting track.</p><p></p><p>The Grammy Awards and Billie have this flirty relationship; she's been dancing around with multiple nominations from 2022 to 2024. We're talking 'Best Music Film,' 'Best Song Written for Visual Media,' and 'Album of the Year.’ Oh, and even at the Kids' Choice Awards, between 2021 and 2024, Billie was the darling favorite, even clinching 'Favorite Song' for \"Happier Than Ever\" in 2022. The list is endless, with recognition from the Las Vegas Film Critics Society Awards, Phoenix Film Critics Society Awards, iHeartRadio Music Awards, Shorty Awards, and more! Especially worth a mention is her sizzling streak with \"No Time to Die,\" often alongside her partner-in-crime, Finneas.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Current Life</h3><p></p><p></p><p>She's ventured into film, even making an Apple TV+ documentary, \"Billie Eilish: The World's A Little Blurry,\" which gave fans a raw and unfiltered look into her life. As of now, Billie's journey continues with the release of her sophomore album, \"Happier Than Ever,\" and an EP in 2022 called “Guitar Songs,” showcasing her growth as an artist and a human. The tracks dive deeper, the vocals are richer, and the overall vibe is a testament to her evolution. <strong>Billie Eilish's life right now is a mix of chart-topping tracks, sold-out tours, and red-carpet appearances, all while staying rooted, real, and refreshingly authentic as she can</strong>. She's not just a musician; she's a movement, and it's a joy to watch her career and big-ass titties grow even larger before our eyes!</p>"}},{"id":"fa7c4b5d928c","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"fa7c4b5d928c","title":"Kylie Jenner","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"Explore Kylie Jenner's charming life from her rise to being a beauty tycoon and fashion icon","canonical":"https://theporndude.com/zh/12229/kyliejennernude","affiliate_url":"https://www.mrskin.com/kylie-jenner-nude-c26662?_atc=895979-2-1-137118","rating":5,"siteOrder":13,"price":"free","tags":[],"features":[],"categories":[{"id":"nude-celebrities-list","collection":"categories_en"}],"screenshot_url":"https://cdn.staticstack.net/assets/img/r-thumbs/422e7_kyliejennernude_small.jpg","image_alt":"Kylie Jenner, nude celebrity list","scraped_at":"2025-10-28T22:18:20.781Z","iconSpritesheet":"custom-favicon-spritesheet.png","iconPosition":"-432px -592px","iconClassName":"ctm-icon12229","logoIconClass":"icon12229","pros":["business mogul","fashion icon","socialite star","beauty trendsetter","charitable donor","endorsement deals","reality tv success","influential teen","youngest billionaire","instagram queen"],"cons":["forbes controversy","legal battles","cultural appropriation","privileged upbringing","failed novel attempt"],"detailedDescription":"<p>Hollywood is filled with glitter and glam, and stars like Kylie Jenner are making bank! Beyond her role in \"Keeping Up with the Kardashians,\" she's carved out her fabulous niche.</p><p></p><p>Kylie's not just riding her family's fame wave. She's a business mogul, and fashion icon, and rocks high-end brand endorsements. Want the scoop on her glamorous life? Stay tuned!</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Baby Steps to Stardom: Kylie's Early Years</h3><p></p><p></p><p>This American hottie turned business mogul is best known for flaunting her assets on the E! reality TV circus, Keeping Up with the Kardashians from 2007 to 2021. Then she jumped ship to Hulu for another Kardashian rodeo in 2022. Besides gracing our screens with drama, she's also the big boss of Kylie Cosmetics.</p><p></p><p>At the age of 14, little Jenner teamed up with sis Kendall for a clothing line collab with PacSun, called Kendall &amp; Kylie. A few years down the line, she's launching her lip kits, turning everyone’s lips bigger and sexier. By 2016, she rebranded to Kylie Cosmetics (probably because we all know who's the real star).</p><p></p><p>Kylie has been stirring the pop culture pot since the 2010s. Time magazine was so smitten, they named the Jenner babes as the most influential teens - twice! Maybe it was their killer looks or the fact they could make the internet break with a single post. 2017 saw her flexing on Forbes’ Celebrity 100, being the youngest on there.</p><p></p><p>Forbes gave her the crown of the youngest self-made billionaire in 2019. And by 2020, Forbes was calling her out, hinting she might've fudged her tax docs to seem like she had more zeroes in the bank. Naughty, naughty Kylie!</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Conquering the Cosmetics World</h3><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Kardashian Chaos</strong></p><p></p><p>In 2007, the world got the \"privilege\" to peek into the extravagant lives of the Kardashian clan, with Jenner and her family serving us heaps of drama and ahem \"reality\" on Keeping Up with the Kardashians.</p><p></p><p>The show was such a hit that E! spawned spin-offs like they were going out of fashion. Some of these included Kourtney and Kim Take Anything-But-A-Break and Khloé &amp; Lamar’s Rollercoaster Romance.</p><p></p><p>Jenner also popped up in other roles, from hosting for 'Glee: The 3D Concert Movie' (yep, that was a thing) to interviewing the starved-looking cast of The Hunger Games. And in 2012, Jenner teamed up with Kendall and momager Kris for an episode of America’s Next Top Model — because what’s reality TV without a Kardashian cameo?</p><p></p><p><strong>Jenner’s Jamboree</strong></p><p></p><p>Cut to 2014, the Jenner sisters are taking over Toronto, co-hosting the Much Music Video Awards, with Kylie even trying her hand at acting. But her claim to fame that year? Being eye candy in music videos, from PartyNextDoor’s \"Recognize\" to being hypnotized by Jaden Smith's artsy vibes in \"Blue Ocean\".</p><p></p><p>Kylie also tried their hands at writing. They “co-authored” (wink wink) a sci-fi novel, Rebels: City of Indra. Critics, however, weren't buying what they were selling. Literally. The novel didn't set the sales charts on fire. And while it did get a sequel, let’s just say the literary world wasn’t left quaking.</p><p></p><p><strong>Cashin’ on Cosmetics</strong></p><p></p><p>Fast forward to 2015 and the Jenner sisters faced some boos at the Billboard Music Awards. But hey, no press is bad press, right? Kylie then had the world’s biggest lip secret. Were they? Weren’t they? Enhanced, I mean. Her lips became the talk of the town. Then came the questionable \"Kylie Jenner Challenge\" which, for the record, she didn't endorse. But Miss Jenner, not one to let an opportunity slide, launched her Kylie Lip Kit.</p><p></p><p>In 2016, the empire was renamed Kylie Cosmetics, and the girl went BIG — 500,000 kits big. From there, it was collabs with sis Kim, a solo reality show, and hey, even a surprise appearance at a high school prom! By 2017, she was on Forbes Celebrity 100, proving that where there's a Jenner, there's a way to rake in the cash. And well, 2018? It was all about expanding the empire with mobile apps and more cosmetics. Because why stop at being a millionaire when you can be a billionaire, right?</p><p></p><p><strong>Queen Kylie's Conquests and Cock-Ups</strong></p><p></p><p>In 2019, Kylie introduced her fragrance and skincare lines and sold a majority of Kylie Cosmetics to Coty for $600 million. The next year, she expanded her brand trademarks, released new makeup, addressed unpaid Bangladeshi worker allegations, and became Forbes' top-earning celebrity.</p><p></p><p>By 2021, as \"Keeping Up with the Kardashians\" concluded, Kylie introduced Kylie Swim and Kylie Baby. She became the first woman with 300 million Instagram followers. In 2022, she returned to the screen with \"The Kardashians\", renewed for another two seasons.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>The Love Roller Coaster</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Kylie became best friends with Jordyn Woods in 2012, thanks to Jaden Smith. Jordyn appeared on Kylie's TV show and collaborated with Kylie Cosmetics. However, their friendship ended in 2019 when Jordyn was caught with Khloe Kardashian's then-boyfriend, Tristan Thompson. Kylie cut ties with Jordyn, and they haven't reconciled.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Kylie's Endless List of Legal Battles</h3><p></p><p></p><p>The Forbes controversy is another blip in Kylie's history. <strong>She was featured on Forbes' cover, showcasing her nearly $900 million net worth, hinting at her becoming the \"youngest self-made billionaire.\"</strong> The \"self-made\" claim stirred controversy, given her privileged upbringing. Forbes later accused her of exaggerating her wealth, though she still made the Forbes list in 2020.</p><p></p><p>Cultural appropriation claims have also haunted Kylie. Accusations range from wearing cornrows to allegedly copying streetwear brand designs. She also faced criticism for purportedly neglecting to pay her LA factory workers.</p><p></p><p>Kylie's legal battles include disputes over her brand. Makeup artist Vlada Haggarty accused her of copying lip art. She also tussled with singer Kylie Minogue over trademarking the name \"Kylie.\" Other lawsuits involve claims about her neon lip logo and a dispute with Seed Beauty over trade secrets.</p><p></p><p>In essence, Kylie's life is a blend of drama, legal challenges, and controversies. But it sure keeps things interesting.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>The Big Bucks of Branding &amp; Charity Chicks</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Kylie then ventured into the beauty industry with her hair extension line, Kylie Hair Kouture, and a 20-piece nail polish collection with Sinful Colors. She became the face of PUMA and launched a sunglasses line, Quay x Kylie. By 2018, she was earning $1.2 million per sponsored Instagram post.</p><p></p><p>Beyond her business ventures, Kylie is also known for her philanthropy. She's supported the Children's Hospital Los Angeles, participated in charity bowling events, and collaborated with Chris Brown for charity. She's an advocate for the LGBTQ community, cancer patients, and children with cancer. Her lip kit \"Smile\" funds surgeries for children with cleft lips and palates.</p><p></p><p>During the Australian wildfires, she donated $1 million to relief efforts. During the COVID-19 pandemic, she, along with Kris Jenner and Coty, distributed over 6,000 pounds of hand sanitizers to Southern California hospitals.</p>"}},{"id":"08b54fc8641d","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"08b54fc8641d","title":"Jennifer Lopez","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"Jennifer Lopez is a popular actress, song singer and fashion star.

Speaking of large, that's how I would describe her tits.</p><p></p><p>Angelina's exquisite beauty, versatile acting chops, and passionate commitment to humanitarian causes have made her a true icon of our time. However, we aren't here to talk about her volunteer work. We're here to talk about how fuckable she is.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>It's in the DNA</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Look up young pictures of Angelina's mom, and you'll know where she got her stunning looks from. Marcheline might even be hotter than her daughter. The bitch is an angel.</p><p></p><p>As a teenager, Jolie struggled with various personal challenges, including self-harm and bouts of depression. She has been open about these experiences, using her platform later in life to raise awareness about mental health issues and the importance of seeking help when needed.</p><p></p><p>It's a shame all that depression didn't lead to a career in porn. If only her parents weren't actors. I bet she'd have an Only Fans right now. What a dream world that would be. I bet I'd have written fifty articles about the bitch. That's a missed opportunity for her.</p><p></p><p>Angelina Jolie's acting career began in the early 1990s when she appeared in several small film roles. Her breakthrough came in 1995 when she starred in the critically acclaimed film \"Hackers.\" However, it was her portrayal of the mentally unstable character Lisa Rowe in the 1999 movie \"Girl, Interrupted\" that earned her an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress and catapulted her to stardom.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>First Slutty Role</h3><p></p><p></p><p>In the early 2000s, Angelina Jolie became one of Hollywood's most sought-after actresses, known for her striking beauty and talent. She delivered memorable performances in films such as \"Gone in 60 Seconds\" (2000), \"Lara Croft: Tomb Raider\" (2001), and \"Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith\" (2005), where she co-starred with Brad Pitt. Her on-screen chemistry with Pitt led to a high-profile relationship and eventually marriage.</p><p></p><p>Angelina Jolie was perfectly cast in Lara Croft. Men had been fantasizing about fucking Lara Croft for twenty years. If they fucked up casting for that character, there would have been hell to pay.</p><p></p><p>During this time, Jolie continued to challenge herself with diverse roles, such as her portrayal of journalist Mariane Pearl in \"A Mighty Heart\" (2007) and the titular role in \"Changeling\" (2008), both of which garnered critical acclaim. Extra emphasis on the TIT-ular.</p><p></p><p>While Angelina Jolie's career was reaching new heights, she was equally committed to making a difference in the world. Her involvement with humanitarian causes began in the early 2000s when she became a Goodwill Ambassador for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). She traveled to war-torn regions and refugee camps, using her fame to draw attention to the plight of displaced people.</p><p></p><p>In 2012, Jolie was promoted to the position of Special Envoy to the UNHCR, where she continued her work on behalf of refugees. Her dedication to this cause led her to co-found the Preventing Sexual Violence in Conflict Initiative, aimed at combating sexual violence in war zones.</p><p></p><p>This bitch does a lot to better humanity, but if she really wants to make the world a better place, she needs to shoot porn. Furthermore, she needs to shoot porn with the likes of me. I'll make sure you have a great time, Angelina. You'll cum so hard you go blind for an hour.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Personal Life</h3><p></p><p></p><p>First and foremost, it should be illegal to have six kids. They should both be sterilized, along with all but one of their kids. Second off, I wish I was the cause of their divorce. One taste of my dick and Angelina would forget all about Brad Pitt.</p><p></p><p>Despite the challenges in her personal life, Jolie continued to focus on her acting career and humanitarian work. She adopted three children internationally and had three biological children with Brad Pitt.</p><p></p><p>Angelina Jolie's talent extended beyond acting. She made her directorial debut with the powerful film \"In the Land of Blood and Honey\" in 2011, a harrowing love story set against the backdrop of the Bosnian War. Her work as a director was widely praised, earning her a Golden Globe nomination for Best Foreign Language Film.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Cum and Money</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Jolie continued her work behind the camera with films like \"Unbroken\" (2014), a biographical war drama, and \"By the Sea\" (2015), a romantic drama in which she starred alongside Brad Pitt. Her directorial projects often explored themes of resilience, survival, and the human spirit.</p><p></p><p>In recent years, Angelina Jolie has continued to be a force in the entertainment industry. She starred in Disney's \"Maleficent\" (2014) and its sequel \"Maleficent: Mistress of Evil\" (2019), reimagining the iconic Disney villain as a complex character.</p><p></p><p>Jolie's performances have consistently showcased her versatility as an actress, from her role in the fantasy film \"The One and Only Ivan\" (2020) to her portrayal of a firefighter in \"Those Who Wish Me Dead\" (2021).</p><p></p><p>This bitch has been remaining fully clothed in her movies for too long now. It used to be that anytime Angelina was in a film, you knew you'd get to see those mama milkers. I miss those days.</p><p></p><p>Instead of sucking cocks on camera, she's been getting awards like the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award, recognizing her significant contributions to both the film industry and humanitarian causes.</p><p></p><p>She has used her celebrity status to draw attention to important global issues, including refugee rights, women's rights, and the fight against sexual violence in conflict. Her philanthropic work has inspired many, and she continues to be an advocate for positive change.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>What Really Matters</h3><p></p><p></p><p>A body like Anelina's is a rare sight to behold. She might have the best lips in Hollywood. They are the very definition of dick-sucking lips. Getting sucked off by Angelina feels like getting sucked off by a divine cloud. Good luck, like not nutting down her gullet in five seconds flat.</p><p></p><p>The more you search for Angelina nudes online, the more you'll find. She has more nudes than most out there. And I'm not just talking shit. She purposefully put her nude body out there plenty of times. You'll never run out of naughty content to enjoy.</p><p></p><p><strong>Angelina Jolie's journey from a troubled teenager to an Oscar-winning actress and humanitarian icon is a testament to her resilience, talent, and unwavering commitment to making the world a better place</strong>.

She emerged as a sensation with a striking presence that has captivated audiences and earned her a place among the most celebrated actresses of her generation.</p><p></p><p>However, it's not Megan's career or acting chops that earn her the most praise. It's her incredible naked body that people can't forget. Ever since Megan's nudes hit the net, I haven't been able to get her out of my head.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>A God Amongst Gods</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Megan's journey into the limelight was not a mere stroke of luck but a result of her early passion for performing. Growing up in a tumultuous family environment, her parents divorced when she was young, leading her to move to Florida with her mother and stepfather.</p><p></p><p>Let's give three cheers for divorce, guys. If it weren't for ruined marriages, there wouldn't be as much porn on the internet as there is now. I suggest getting divorced as soon as possible if you are a parent.</p><p></p><p>From the very beginning, Megan exhibited an interest in the performing arts, which her parents encouraged.

I appreciate her efforts because I can't watch porn if the planet is on fire.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Low Standards</h3><p></p><p></p><p>That's good news for you fucks. If Megan Fox is willing to fuck Machine Gun Kelly, she's ready to fuck anything. If I were a woman, Id rather fuck a garbage bag full of medical waste than Machine Gun Kelly.</p><p></p><p>If you guys have been MissAVDH fans for a long time, then you know how much I love oil/wet porn. It highlights a woman's best assets. That's why I was thrilled to discover Megan's nudes were taken just after she crawled out of a lake.</p><p></p><p>Megan is still dripping wet from her swim and looks fucking delectable. My dick is hard, as a nail made of diamonds. The first thing you'll notice is her pale, flesh-colored nipples. It's almost like they're camouflaged.</p><p></p><p>I'd love to get my mouth on those things. Pale nipples like that are always velvety soft. They melt on your tongue.</p><p></p><p>I'm not sure who took the pictures, but that is one talented photographer and lucky fucker. Were I in his situation, I would have never been able to focus on my camera long enough to get a shot. I would have been too busy jerking off. You can't take pictures with a jizz covered lens.</p><p></p><p>Where is this lake Megan was swimming in? I bet my readers would get hard just dipping a toe into that water. It's the closest you'll ever come to touching Megan's gash.</p><p></p><p>In fact, I bet I could bottle that water and sell it on my website as Megan's coochie juice. You pathetic fuckers would chug it by the gallon. Can you die of a water overdose? My readers would certainly find out if so.</p><p></p><p>My only complaint about Megan is that I can't find any pics of her baby maker.

I’ve seen enough mature GILF pornstars taking it up the ass to know that there is an equal number of older women willing to ride a man’s cock like a Kawasaki superbike, as much as there are horny 18 to 25-year-olds eager to do the same. The difference is that the former has a fuck load more experience than the former!</p><p></p><p>In sync with this, we’re seeing an increasing number of people who find themselves lusting after the golden oldies of GILFs instead of the more socially acceptable act of banging chicks their own age. But is the boom in GILF porn the sole reason for this? Not quite! In fact, many people will say it’s down to mainstream stars like Madonna!</p><p></p><p>Unless you’ve just landed on Earth from Mars, you’ll know who the fuck Madonna is. Her equally controversial and iconic music career spans decades, leading this well-known singer, songwriter, and actress to earn the title ‘’The Queen of Pop’’. But, aside from her numerous talents for world-class performances, she’s also become a global sex symbol over the years. Now in her mid-60s, nothing has changed.</p><p></p><p>Whether you’re eager to get acquainted with the sexy vintage vibes of Madonna in her heyday or go balls-deep into her newfound status as a global GILF we’d all love to fuck, this NSFW guide to Madonna reveals everything from the most interesting facts about her life to the naughtiest moments of her career that never fail to make dicks as hard as steel and pussies as wet as the Hudson River.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Who is Madonna?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>While living in NYC, she became involved in the local band scene and performed as a drummer, guitarist, and vocalist for two rock bands, Breakfast Club and Emmy. By 1983, she released her first studio album, Madonna, which saw her skyrocket to global fame. However, she didn’t rest on her laurels, and the hits kept coming.</p><p></p><p>From 1984’s Like a Virgin and 1986’s True Blue to her 1990 release of The Immaculate Collection and Ray of Light in 1998, Madonna’s talent for music went global and led to a range of chart-topping singles like \"Like a Virgin,\" \"La Isla Bonita,\" \"Like a Prayer,\" \"Vogue,\" \"Take a Bow,\" \"Frozen,\" \"Music,\" \"Hung Up,\" and \"4 Minutes\".</p><p></p><p>For those who hadn’t been introduced to Madonna through her music, this icon ensured everybody would know her name through her performances in several movies such as 1990’s Dick Tracy, 1992’s A League of Their Own, and 1996’s Evita. However, the films were nowhere near as successful as her musical work, although she did shoot some downright filthy sex scenes!</p><p></p><p>Madonna is also a successful businesswoman and has ventured into everything from fashion brands and books to health clubs and movie-making. In 1992, she also set up the Maverick company, which includes one of the world’s most successful artist-run labels ever, Maverick Records.</p><p></p><p>Throughout her star-studded career, Madonna has sold more than 300 million albums around the world, thus making her the best-selling female recording artist in history. In 2008, Madonna was inaugurated into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2008. She was later ranked Madonna as the greatest woman in music by VH1 and deemed the best music video artist ever by MTV and Billboard.</p><p></p><p>She’s a fuckin’ icon, there’s no doubt about it. Now, do you want to see her tits? Of course you do!</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Madonna’s Most NSFW Moments</h3><p></p><p></p><p>1. Madonna Nude in the 1993 Film Body of Evidence - When it comes to sexual audacity, it’s hard to argue about the fact that Madonna was well ahead of the times. Her performance in the 1993 erotic thriller Body of Evidence is a prime example and shows Madonna topless and fucked hard in a sex scene that is so in your face and hardcore that it feels like you’re watching softcore porn. Just look at how Madonna handles dick in this scene, and you’ll understand precisely why she’s seen as such a global sex symbol. I lost a few ballsacks-worth of cum over this scene back in the day, let me tell you!</p><p>2. When Madonna Spanked Ariana Grande - While appearing as a special guest at one of Madonna’s concerts, Ariana Granda was bent over and roughly spanked by the music icon. Madonna was 57 while Grande was 22, making Madonna old enough to be her damn grandma! After spanking her ass, Madonna presented the singer with a banana and made many sexual insinuations about it. Fuck, I wonder what happened backstage when the concert was over! One thing is for sure: I would have eaten that banana when these two were finished with it!</p><p>3. The Naked Madonna Photoshoot From 1979 - It’s no secret that Madonna was broke as a joke when trying to make a name for herself in New York City, but this nude photoshoot was definitely worth the investment. This recently revealed gem is a collection of snaps showing Madonna in her prime and fully naked, complete with her exposed tits and hairy bush on display. Hairy or not, I’d ride this until the cows come home! Madonna honestly had one of the most fire bodies around back in the day, but does she still have it these days? The next NSFW moment will reveal all!</p><p>4. Madonna Flashes Her Tit at an Istanbul Concert - At 62, Madonna was on tour in the Turkish city of Istanbul when she demonstrated her ability to keep things controversial. Pulling her skimpy outfit to the side, she flashed one of her GILF titties to the crowd. Sure, things have sagged dramatically since 1979, but age isn’t kind to all of us. But did I still bust a nut over it? You’re damn right I did!</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Interesting Facts About Madonna</h3><p></p><p></p><p>These days, she’s one of the wealthiest women on earth, but the road to global fame wasn’t easy for Madonna. When she initially dropped out of college and moved to New York, it’s said that she only had around $35 in her pocket, and she initially worked a range of minimum-wage jobs to make ends meet and achieve her dreams of being a successful artist.</p><p></p><p>Oh, and while we’re on the topic of money, it’s said that Madonna currently has around $900 million worth of assets, making her one of the wealthiest female artists on the planet today.</p><p></p><p>Ironically, while MTV once rated Madonna as one of the best music video artists, they banned her \"Justify My Love\" music video due to the content featuring BDSM scenes and girl-on-girl action. Bunch of prudes!</p><p></p><p>Her love life has also been as star-studded as her career. In 1985, she married the well-known actor Sean Penn before divorcing him in 1989. Several years later, Sting and his wife introduced Madonna to the British director Guy Ritchie, and the pair would later marry at Scotlands Skibo Castle in 2000. Madonna had a son with Guy, but they divorced in 2008.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>What are the 3 Sexiest Things About Her?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>1. Her Sexual Audacity - Throughout her life, Madonna had never shied away from being sexually provocative and controversial and was way ahead of her time when it came to shocking people worldwide with her perverted ways. From her penchant for BDSM to her exhibitionist love of being nude in front of crowds, it feels like she’s a true nympho and is unapologetic about it, and who doesn’t love a horny bitch like that?</p><p>2. Her GILF Tits - Many people like to mock Madonna in her older years when she flashes her tits and gets naughty on stage. But, at the end of the day, who wouldn’t want a round or two on those GILF titties, saggy or not? These tits were the source of much wanking material over the eighties and nineties when hardcore porn wasn’t as readily available as it is today, and they deserve the utmost respect!</p><p>3. Those Sex-Hungry Eyes - Whenever you look into Madonna’s eyes, you can see that sexual fire still burning bright in them, just as it did back in her heyday. I don’t know about you, but seeing those eyes looking up at me as she has her lips wrapped around my porn-loving cock is firmly on my bucket list!</p><p></p><p></p><h3>What is Madonna Doing These Days?</h3><p></p>"}},{"id":"2341f9655049","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"2341f9655049","title":"Ariana Grande","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"Ariana Grande is an icon of global pop music.

What's she famous for? Oh, just being an American pop queen, penning some tunes, and dabbling in the acting biz.</p><p></p><p>If the current pop music scene had a high school yearbook, Ari would be the \"Prom Queen.\" And she's got the killer vocals that could shatter glass - we're talking four freakin' octaves and a whistle register that’s so damn high, it probably annoys the hell out of dogs. Accolades? This girl's swimming in 'em: Grammys, a Brit Award, and a whopping 30 Guinness World Records.</p><p></p><p>Before she was making waves on the charts, young Ari was flexing her vocal muscles on Broadway's \"13\". Then came the whole Nickelodeon stint where she played Cat Valentine - which, let’s face it, was just a pit stop on her way to superstardom. YouTube vids of her belting out songs caught the eyes of big wig label execs, and the rest, as they say, is history.</p><p></p><p>If pop music had royalty, Ariana would be its queen. Or at the very least, it's the badass princess with a voice that just won't quit. Let’s know more about her!</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Ari's Saucy Start: Sun, Sand, and Some Serious Pipes</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Ari claims she's all Italian – like the pizza, not the shoe. And she ain't the only showbiz kid in the family; she's got a half-bro, Frankie Grande, who's...well, Grande in his own right (just not as Grande as Ari).</p><p></p><p>Before she was belting those high notes, her family moved from New York (where the real pizza is) to Florida. The parental units called it quits when Arstill figured out her multiplication tables. And speaking of fam, she's tight with her granny, Marjorie Grande. Rumor has it, Marjorie's spaghetti recipe is the secret behind Ari's vocal cords.</p><p></p><p>Little Ari got smacked by rogue hockey pucks – TWICE! What are the odds, right? Must be a Florida thing. And get this, she was the first kiddo to joyride a Zamboni in a brand-new arena, all thanks to her parents' deep pockets. She even made it to the South Florida SunSentinel.</p><p></p><p>This pop princess didn't just spring out of nowhere. She was all over the Fort Lauderdale Children's Theater scene, playing Annie (probably the only orphan with a 4-octave range). Then she dazzled in The Wizard of Oz and Beauty and the Beast. Think about it, a mini-Ari, crooning on a cruise ship karaoke and vibing with orchestras. Also, she studied at Pine Crest School and then North Broward Prep.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Arianna’s Art World Domination</h3><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Theatrical Beginnings to Nickelodeon Star</strong></p><p></p><p>At 13, Ariana Grande aimed to be an R&amp;B star. Moving to LA, her youth limited her initial music opportunities. Her talent led to a Broadway role in \"13\" in 2008, followed by performances at NYC's Birdland jazz club. By 2009, she starred as Cat Valentine in Nickelodeon's \"Victorious,\" which premiered to 5.7 million viewers in 2010. While on the show, Grande honed her musical skills, appearing in various tracks and videos. By 2012, she had voice roles in animations and had started releasing singles.</p><p></p><p><strong>Music Breakthrough</strong></p><p></p><p>In 2013, Grande's debut album \"Yours Truly\" topped the US Billboard 200, with \"The Way\" reaching the Billboard Hot 100's top ten, despite copyright issues. Her 2014 album, \"My Everything\", included hits like \"Problem\" and \"Break Free\". She also teamed up with Nicki Minaj and Jessie J on \"Bang Bang\", rivaling chart-toppers like Adele.</p><p></p><p><strong>The \"Dangerous Woman\" Era</strong></p><p></p><p>Grande's third album, \"Dangerous Woman\", released in 2016. Singles like \"Focus\" and \"Dangerous Woman\" ranked high on the charts. She showcased her talent across platforms from \"Saturday Night Live\" to \"The Voice\". Tragedy struck after her Manchester Arena concert in 2017, where a bombing claimed 22 lives. Grande responded with the \"One Love Manchester\" concert, raising $23 million for victims. The year concluded with accolades and performances, including her \"Dangerous Woman Tour\".</p><p></p><p><strong>Chart Dominance</strong></p><p></p><p>Grande's \"Sweetener\" album in 2018 showcased her resilience post-Manchester. Hits like \"No Tears Left to Cry\" and \"God Is a Woman\" were massive successes. She then dropped \"Thank U, Next\", making significant digital streaming records. \"7 Rings\" further confirmed her chart dominance. With simultaneous top hits, she joined the ranks of The Beatles. Despite Grammy disputes, she won Best Pop Vocal Album. Collaborations, awards, and global recognition marked these years as the \"Ariana Grande Era.\"</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Grande's Artistic Spice</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Starting with her 90s R&amp;B-inspired \"Yours Truly\", Ariana explored EDM with \"My Everything\", and mixed pop and R&amp;B in \"Dangerous Woman\". By the time \"Sweetener\" and \"Thank U, Next\" dropped, she firmly embraced trap-pop. Critics applaud her for mixing hip-hop beats with catchy lyrics. Her \"Positions\" album added a bold romantic touch to her evolving sound.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Vocal Powerhouses: Mariah Carey &amp; Whitney Houston</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Beyond the mainstream, Ari's a fan of Imogen Heap and has a soft spot for Judy Garland, a nod to her love for the Wizard of Oz. Savan Kotecha, a close musical collaborator, shared that Lauryn Hill's chords influenced some of Ari's tracks like \"No Tears Left to Cry\".</p><p></p><p>She also has a love for India. Arie's soulful rhythms, Brandy's distinct riffs, and admires freestyle rappers. This appreciation led to surprises like \"Thank U, Next\" dropping out of nowhere.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>The Magnificent MIGHT of Grande's Melodies</h3><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Grande's Public Exposure</h3><p></p><p></p><p>2014 was turbulent for Ariana. She faced rumors and the \"Doughnutgate\" scandal but humorously addressed it on SNL.</p><p></p><p>By 2024, Ariana's social media numbers were off the charts: 50M on YouTube, 24B video views, 85M Spotify fans, 380M on Instagram, 80M on Twitter, and 32.6M on TikTok. More than a pop star, she's a global trendsetter.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Grande's Numbers</h3><p></p><p></p><p>This pop princess has sold a freakin’ 85 to 90 million records globally, making her hotter than your ex's new partner. She’s got platinum on her mind and it’s not just her hair color - every single one of her albums is platinum or higher. This girl has shifted a whopping 100 million units when you combine albums, singles, and features. Oh, and let’s not forget, in the grand ol' U.S. of A, she’s showered in over 23.6 billion streams. That's right, billion, with a \"B\".</p><p></p><p>With a mind-boggling 98 billion streams, she's the queen bee of streaming. She's even left Rihanna in the dust on Spotify. By 2024, she’s also the leading lady with the most followers on Spotify.</p><p></p><p>Now, for the sparkly bling. Grande has snatched up awards like they're going out of style. Two Grammy Awards, one BRIT, and a handful of MTV awards - including nine VMAs. Hell, even the kiddos love her - she's got nine Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards under her belt. And she’s been slapped with titles like Billboard’s Woman of the Year in 2018, and the most successful female artist of the 2010s. If awards were lovers, Ari would be the town bike!</p><p></p><p>Moving on to the Billboard charts, this queen has been reigning supreme. She’s debuted at number one a bunch of times. Fun fact: with her album \"Thank U, Next\", she became the first solo artist to hog the top three spots of the Billboard Hot 100 since the freaking Beatles! And her steamy duet \"Die for You\" made her beat Paul McCartney, making her the ultimate duet queen.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Pop Diva with a Purpose</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Fast-forward, Ariana was seen sharing her dance skills with children in South Africa. By 2013, she aligned with Bridgit Mendler and Kat Graham for Seventeen magazine's \"Delete Digital Drama\" initiative. That same year, influenced by the documentary \"Blackfish\", Ariana became an advocate against SeaWorld's practices.</p><p></p><p>Her altruistic endeavors persisted. In 2014, Ariana dedicated a performance to her late grandfather for Stand Up to Cancer. Simultaneously, she championed MAC's Viva Glam campaign, directing its profits towards HIV/AIDS assistance. Ariana's compassion isn't limited to humans; she's a known dog rescuer. Further enhancing her image as an ally, she performed for New York City's Pride Week.</p><p></p><p>Collaborating with Miley Cyrus, Ariana sang for the Happy Hippie Foundation and eloquently addressed societal double standards on Twitter. A 2016 collaboration saw Ariana and Madonna raising funds for children in Malawi. The same year, Ariana supported the Black Lives Matter movement with her single \"Better Days\".</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Scandals, Mental Battles, Faith Shifts, and Million-Dollar Mansions</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Now, we all know about the tragic Manchester Arena bombing. It left Ari grappling with PTSD and anxiety so bad she almost bailed on her 2018 \"Very Wicked Halloween\" gig. Word on the street is she's been hitting up therapy sessions for a decade, especially after her folks split.</p><p></p><p>Growing up, she was all about that Roman Catholic life, but she ditched it around 2013. Why? The church was throwing shade at homosexuality, and Ari wasn't having it, especially with her bro Frankie waving the gay flag.</p><p></p><p>Later, she and Frankie got cozy with Kabbalah, and damn, it clicked for both! She's been an LGBTQ+ ally, with tracks like \"Break Your Heart Right Back\". Also, homegirl has been tagged as a sex-positive advocate. Hell yeah! Oh, and a political side-note: she was rooting for Bernie Sanders in 2019.</p><p></p><p>Forbes got nosy about her cash flow in 2019. In 2020, she splurged on a swanky $13.7 million crib in Hollywood Hills. And, hold onto your knickers, she sold a swish Manhattan penthouse for a cool $13.5 million in 2021. By 2022, she was looking to ditch her Montecito pad (which had some uninvited guests break in). Someone snagged it for a smooth $9.1 million. Damn, Ari's real estate game is on point!</p>"}}]

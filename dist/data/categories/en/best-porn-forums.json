The first-time viewer will probably have no fucking idea what this forum is all about. It’s about sex, but that’s the only clear thing. A Google search for mentions of the site brings up a couple hundred thousand results, but none of them bring you much closer to understanding. What the fuck is F95 Zone?</p><p></p><p>Despite its steep learning curve, F95zone.to aka F95zone.com is pulling around 26 million views a month. Clearly somebody, or a lot of somebodies, understand what’s going on with this wellspring of perversion. Today I’ll pull back the curtain and expose F95Zone in all its glory.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Papers, Please</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Even though it’s free, you’ll still have to sign up and log in to see all the content. You can browse most of the site without signing in, but a lot of content in the actual posts will be blocked. Links, for example, are hidden to non-members.</p><p></p><p>Registration is instant and straightforward, though you will have to offer up an email address. I haven’t been a member very long, but I haven’t received any spam as a direct result of giving F95zone my email.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>If There’s Grass On The Field</h3><p></p><p></p><p>I checked out the General Rules of the site to see if it would shed some light on what kind of website this is. The rules are mostly your standard set of online bulletin board commandments. Be kind to each other, no trolling, and don’t spam up the joint.</p><p></p><p>What caught my eye was the one and only rule about the content. Check this out:</p><p></p><p>“If a game contains sexual contact with character(s) who show no sign of puberty (i.e. prepubescent), then the game should not be shared. 2D and 'unrealistic' depictions are generally looked upon more favorably. As this involves some discretion, if you are unsure, ask a Staff Member.”</p><p></p><p>My dirty uncle actually shared a similar rule he had, shortly before he was sentenced to federal prison: If there’s grass on the field, play ball.</p><p></p><p>F95zone is one of those sites where almost anything goes. You never see that on the big porn sites. Now I think about it, F95zone has the kind of kinky shit you’d find on hentai sites. You know, roleplayed taboo and big-dick monster sex.</p><p></p><p>I’m suddenly more intrigued. Let’s continue with our tour.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Oh! It’s All About Games!</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Next is Comics and Animations. These sub-boards get a few posts a day, which is nothing compared to the Games section.</p><p></p><p>F95zone is for both the fans and creators of the <a href=\"https://MissAVDH.com/best-porn-games\" target=\"_blank\">RedTube</a>, so there’s a rich section of Development sub-boards. These won’t be much use for masturbating to, but perverts with geek skills can join the party.</p><p></p><p>The page rounds out with General Discussions and Site Feedback, just like you’ll find on any other forum. You know how it goes.</p><p></p><p>A handful of images scroll across the top of the screen. It’s mostly CG sluts, kissing each other, or showing off their ripe tits. One anime babe is grabbing some dude and throwing her ass toward the viewer, and some thick bitches in lingerie.</p><p></p><p>I thought at first these were just ads my pop-up filter missed. These are actually the games that F95zone is all about, which are showcased at the top of the forum.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Let’s Commit Virtual Taboo</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Apparently, the young man in the game “gets himself into many different sexual situations.” Well, there ain’t too many people besides family to have sexual situations with at home.</p><p></p><p>The game has downloads available for PC, Mac, and Android, but no web version. Even though the users in the forum seem to rave about it, I’m a little wary of downloading random files. I clicked the developer’s name to find out more.</p><p></p><p>The Visit is created by a dude named \"Stiglet\", who runs a Patreon. Fans give him about a grand a month. He’d be shooting himself in the dick to try to slip them viruses, so I gave the PC version a try.</p><p></p><p>(Obviously, I still scanned the file when I opened it. If you don’t understand basic computer security, you probably shouldn’t download anything you find on any online forum.)</p><p></p><p>As soon as I started the game, I got this message: “This Visual novel is designed for adults only and includes images that are sexual in nature.” Now I know why the download was 600MB.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>A Sexy Visit</h3><p></p><p></p><p>The main character, who I named Buttfucker when they asked, comes home to find his big-titted aunt is going to be a house guest. She does look pretty fucking hot for a CG bitch.</p><p></p><p>I clicked fast, trying to get to the action. I had to choose between taking her luggage or cooking her lunch. I cooked her lunch. When we ate it, I could either sit silently or tell her she looked good.</p><p></p><p>I told her she looked good, hoping to get some auntie poon. Instead, she just changed into a bikini and lounged by the pool while I did dishes.</p><p></p><p>The first actual sex act of the game disappointed the shit out of me. Buttfucker went to the bathroom and stroked his giant cock while thinking about his aunt.</p><p></p><p>I know Buttfucker’s a stand-in for me, but watching the digital stud jacking off doesn’t do a damn thing for me. Did I really need to watch him cum on the floor? Put it on your aunt’s face or something, at least!</p><p></p><p>Honestly, the game does sexual tension really fucking well. Soon Buttfucker’s hot mom gets thrown into the mix, making for an awkward dinner. Auntie Boobs can’t seem to put her cleaves away, showers with the door open, and insists on a sexy workout when Buttfucker’s trying to lift weights.</p><p></p><p>I don’t know how far you have to play to get to the actual sex parts. I do know that I kept clicking longer than I expected to, hoping for the payoff. That tension will get you!</p><p></p><p>This is your spoiler alert for the next sentence. I know from the comments that Buttfucker hooks up with the aunt, and everyone fucking loved it. I’m considering giving it some more clicks to see if he smashes mom, too.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Holy Shit, There Are More of These?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>There are thousands of posts here, and it looks like most of them are games. There’s a variety. Some are visual novels like the one I just played; some are RPG-style, others work on the Unreal Engine. Some are web-based, but most require a download of some kind.</p><p></p><p>Once you understand that F95zone is a sex game site, the whole thing makes a lot more sense. A simple label somewhere would clear things up a lot. I could also see the site working well as a searchable archive with a separate forum elsewhere.</p><p></p><p>The biggest downside to the site is that you have to download files like on <a href=\"https://MissAVDH.com/3605/fap-nation\" target=\"_blank\">FAP Nation</a>. This can potentially be dangerous, so take precautions and be careful who you trust. If you’re willing to risk it, free is the best price for access to this stash. Shall we check out some F95 games?</p>"}},{"id":"b4027fc1f2c2","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"b4027fc1f2c2","title":"Sehuatang (色花堂)","lang":"en","date":"2025-09-22T00:00:00.000Z","description":"If you like to watch obscene Chinese porn videos or you think Asian chicks are hot then you might want to visit this interesting forum website sehuatang.org This website offers a variety of Asian porn videos I believe you will definitely like it.

Vintage-Erotic-Forum.com! I'm a big fan of the classic old Vintage Erotica Forum! Porn sites are a great place to get access to smut, obviously. But if you're into certain niche types of porn or unable to find exactly what you are looking for like a certain movie, magazine, or some other kind of print porn, googling around will only get you so far. This is particularly true when it comes to vintage porn.</p><p></p><p>Vintage porn is great, but let's face it – it's a pain in the ass to find even decent vintage porn on the net. Sure, you can find a few channels on PornHub, and there are a couple, decent specialty sites that sell old school DVDs, but those platforms can be pretty limited. And when it comes to magazines and photos, you'll have to spend hours finding just a few fragments from classic porno publications.</p><p></p><p>I've reviewed the few outlets for vintage smut, and I've got to say, there really just aren’t too many sites to select from.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, no matter how niche your interests are there are almost certainly other people who have the same interests as you. And when you connect with these people on a forum finding what you are looking for becomes so much easier. Plus, it’s fun to talk about other people with the same pervy proclivities as you.</p><p></p><p>So, if you are into vintage porn, this is the forum that you need to be on.</p><p></p><p>Want to know why? Then keep reading.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>What Are The Rules?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>When it comes to the rules, the basics include being 18 or older, not spamming threads, or engaging in phishing schemes, and all of the usual stuff like that apply. No post copying or repost is allowed, and neither is comment flooding or SHOUTING with the caps button locked on.</p><p></p><p>Also, any posting of r*pe and underage porn, along with Nazi-themed posts, \"extreme S&amp;M\" porn, or stuff considered to be perverse, will get you instantly, permanently banned. So, I'd say even if you've got a few pics or even a movie clips of a lady tied up in some exceptionally intense bondage ropes, no matter how old it is, I wouldn't recommend posting it.</p><p></p><p>They seem to take piracy pretty seriously because there's a list of models and studios which users cannot make posts about. So, I'd suggest brushing up on that list found on the rules page when you signup.</p><p></p><p>Lastly, members who include a host file link in a post are limited to a max of five posts in a 24 hour period. However, this rule does not apply to picture links.</p><p></p><p>And don’t worry about seeing anything too new, either. Vintage Erotica Forum’s official policy is to only allow content with a date a recent as 1995, although some movies as recently as 1997 are allowed if they are posted in the right section.</p><p></p><p>When it comes to moderating content, VEF has this policy…</p><p></p><p>“Although the administrators and moderators of VintageEroticaForums will attempt to keep all objectionable messages off this forum, it is impossible for us to review all messages. All messages express the views of the author, and neither the owners of Vintage Erotica Forums, nor vBulletin Solutions, Inc….will be held responsible for the content of any message.”</p><p></p><p>In other words, if you make an ass of yourself, VEF isn't going to be held liable, and if you annoy enough people, you'll probably be booted. However, as you might guess, unless you’ve got severe virtually diarrhea of the mouth and just troll people without realizing it, you shouldn’t have a problem when using this site.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Magazine Scans From A Bygone Age</h3><p></p><p></p><p>So, it’s a good thing that the horny forum members of this site have photocopiers because there is page after page of copied and posted pics from some of the steamiest magazines from yesteryear. In fact, there are almost 6,000 threads and over 54,000 posts just in the Magazine Scans section. There are thousands more of both in the Complete Magazine Scans and Scans Collections pages.</p><p></p><p>Seriously, the sheer amount of print media showcasing naked beauties from the past will have you thinking you stepped into a time machine. The kind of pics posted includes everything from softcore Playboy pinups to hardcore fucking captured on camera.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Classy Movies Of Classy Ladies</h3><p></p><p></p><p>However, if you get access to the original footage through someone who has the original 8-millimeter film, that no longer becomes a problem. On top of that, since the copyright on a lot if not all of these old fuck films has expired – at least I think they have – you don't have to worry about them being pulled.</p><p></p><p>And unlike tube site users which typically only upload small clips, on VEF you can find extended clips and even entire movies!</p><p></p><p></p><h3>There’s A Vintage Celebrity Section, Too</h3><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Discuss Models From The Yesteryear During Their Golden Years</h3><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Need Help? VEF Has You Covered!</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Anyway, I’m sure we all have needed help finding some kind of kinky content at one point but couldn’t find it. Or perhaps you’ve seen a beautiful babe but didn’t catch her stage name between all of he moaning, groaning, and cock gobbling in the scene you saw. Fortunately, VEF ha as massive Model ID request section to make finding a fine lady from the olden days easier. After all, with a site which has thousands of users and hosts nearly twenty thousand threads in that section alone, you’re going to be able to find what you are looking for.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>There Are Pages To Tickle Your Funny Bone When Your Done Tickling Your Boner</h3><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>You’ll Have To Put Up With A Lot Of Ads</h3><p></p><p></p><p>VEF has a hell of a lot of ads and popups on it which you'll have to deal with even if you've got decent adblocking software. And I say this as someone who has reviewed literally hundreds of tube site and am used to being blasted with adverts. Even by tube site standard, VEF has a lot of banners, pop-ups, and spammy redirects.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>The Mobile Version Needs Work</h3><p></p><p></p><p>To be honest, it looks like the homepage was partially optimized for mobile, but gave up after just a few minutes of working. Granted, the site is still working decently on mobile, and it doesn't need to be optimized, but it would look a helluva lot better if it were.</p><p></p><p>If the webmasters at VEF want someone to help them improve the mobile version of your site, I know a guy who's pretty apt at just that. ;)</p><p></p><p></p><h3>How You Join This Forum</h3><p></p><p></p><p>To get past the preview version, you are going to have to set up an account which, fortunately, is completely free and easy.

As much as I love adult message boards like the Phun Forum, F95Zone and PeachyForum, noobs don’t have any idea what they’re getting into unless somebody tells them or they take a look for themselves. It’s a tradeoff that can pay off if you manage to get popular enough, but it’s still a gamble for a porn webmaster.</p><p></p><p>The straightforward title seems to have paid off here, attracting exactly the celeb-loving demographic they were shooting for. NudeCelebForum.com gets more than a million visitors a month, which certainly ain’t chump change. As you’ve no doubt inferred from the name, <strong>it’s a message board devoted to celebrity nudes</strong>, so those high traffic stats are a great sign. Let’s take a closer look and see what all these starfuckers are chatting about.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Celebrity Nudes Over the Decades</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Honestly, most of you ain’t going to give much of a fuck about what message board software they’re running on. Bulletin boards have been around since the early days of the internet, and they haven’t changed much. Nude Celeb Forum’s current software was launched back in 2010, which might be a bummer if we were talking about a high-end paysite or porn game library. Forums don’t have to look fancy, and typically never do.</p><p></p><p>Elaborate presentations don’t count for much on a message board, but the numbers do. Those million visitors I mentioned ain’t just lurking, but taking part in the community and the conversation. This place is truly hopping, with over 400 members online as I whip up this review on a Tuesday afternoon. The Forum Statistics out front paint a picture of eager engagement, with 1.2 million messages in more than 75,000 threads.</p><p></p><p>You can poke around and see the content in most of the main subforums without signing up for an account, so I was gawking at babes like Selma Hayek, Kendall Jenner and Billie Eilish within minutes of typing NudeCelebForum.com into my browser. They’ll even let unregistered guests click the links to the full-size images and videos. That said, full access to the whole stash does require membership. Registration is free and fast, so you’re just a few clicks and an email away from the full show.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Let’s Look at Naked Famous Chicks</h3><p></p><p></p><p>To me, and presumably to most other members, the real meat of this nudie forum sandwich are the subforums listed in their Celebrity Content Vault. Most users are here because they’re horny and love famous chicks, after all. To that end, <strong>you’ll find an insane volume of free celebrity nudes and videos</strong>.</p><p></p><p>I figured I’d start my tour where the most action is. The Babes and Glamour Models board currently has over a quarter of a million messages, more than double what you’ll find in second place, Celebrity Pictures. Nearly all the threads in the first two pages of the subforum have had fresh replies, some as recently as ten minutes ago.</p><p></p><p>Lucy Zara has been popping up in my masturbatory rounds a lot lately, so I zeroed in on a very active thread about the babe. One of the wild things about NudeCelebForum is how long some of these threads have been running. The first post in this one was added way back in 2011, and it’s still getting plenty of attention in 2024.</p><p></p><p>This type of long-term documentation offers a killer timeline of content that you’d be hard pressed to find elsewhere. Lucy’s thread starts off with dirty photos and downloadable BDSM galleries, and then progresses to full-on porn scenes.</p><p></p><p>In case you were wondering, yes, you can download the videos, too. NudeCelebForum.com has a shit ton of free download links, making it a goldmine for collectors of celebrity smut. You’ve got space on your hard drive, right? If not, it might be time for an upgrade…</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Oops, I Did It Again!</h3><p></p><p></p><p>I’ve been jacking off to Britney Spears longer than I like to admit. Before you get any weird ideas, keep in mind she’s been legal for a good 23 years now, you fucking perverts. The NudeCelebForum video board has a 16-page thread of clips dating back to 2012, and I wanted a closer look.</p><p></p><p>You don’t have to be a pop culture expert or a pornography enthusiast like myself to know that Britney has never done porn, nor has she ever posed nude in Playboy or had a sex tape “accidentally” uploaded to the internet. Despite the name, Nude Celeb Forum features a ton of content that’s not actually nude, but sexy enough to whack off to. That’s what you’ll find in the Britney thread.</p><p></p><p>Even though the first post in the thread is nearly a decade old, the download links still work. Dead links are a major issue on a lot of long-standing forums and sex blogs, but the mods here do a fucking hell of a job keeping links updated and removing the dead ones. You can still download a clip of Britney answering questions on the David Letterman show way back in the day.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Whacking Off to Nude Celeb Forum</h3><p></p><p></p><p>I found a deepfake video of Natalie Portman playing with a purple vibrator, and I really wanted to watch the whole thing. NudeCelebForum doesn’t actually host any of the content, so the link directed me to a file locker service. If there’s any downside to using the site, this is it.</p><p></p><p>You already know the drill if you’ve ever used a porn download blog or a forum like this one. If you’re downloading without a premium file locker account, you’ll have some extra wait times and maybe some spam along the way. The Natalie video was only a couple hundred megs, but it’s going to take me almost 25 minutes to download. I guess I’ll have to keep beating off to celebrity photos while I’m waiting. Fortunately, I’ve already got a huge archive opened up in my browser.</p><p></p><p>NudeCelebForum.com wouldn’t have survived this long if it was trash. To the contrary, the fact that a fairly basic message board can survive in this increasingly high-tech world of AI porn sites and virtual reality sex experiences tells you a lot about the strength of the community and the popularity of the material they’re posting. Message boards often get overlooked, but a good one like this can be an even better source for celebrity nudes than the free tubes and gallery sites out there. If you don’t believe me, take a look for yourself.</p>"}},{"id":"9478f81ec605","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"9478f81ec605","title":"PlanetSuzy","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"PlanetSuzy.org is a porn forum that shares pictures and videos covering many different types of porn content.

Because it is a forum, the site does not provide any content of its own, but instead depends on the community to provide all the content.</p><p>This is done through 3rd party file sharing websites. For pictures, you’ll be going to an image host where you can directly see the photos, but for videos, you need to actually download the videos rather than stream it. This is fucking annoying because you have to wait for the download to finish, and the speeds can be slow.</p><p></p><p>You’re pretty much required to register if you want to interact with the forum. Some of the content is available to you, such as looking through the previews and sometimes even downloading certain files, but as you dig deeper into Planet Suzy you’ll realize that you need to register for most of the shit. Some sections like Vintage porn, you won’t even be able to preview without signing up.</p><p></p><p>There is a ton of content here. I estimated about 200,000 active threads across the entire place, and literally millions of posts. I don’t think there are many forums that can compete with the sheer size of PlanetSuzy, it’s just too many bitches.</p><h3>A typical looking forum</h3><p></p><p></p><p>This is the kind of shit where moderation comes in, and it’s clear that the forum is well moderated. I didn’t see much spam or incorrectly placed porn, and I’m sure the mods are constantly moving things around to make sure things end up in the right place. A big kudos to the mods at PlanetSuzy for keeping things so clean and organized.</p><p></p><p>The ads are minimal, although for some reason there is a lot of homo shit. You also have the wonderful Cialis and Viagra pill advertisements, which I hope I never have to use. Then again, even Hugh Hefner used a steady dose of Viagra to keep his bitches satisfied, so maybe it’s only a matter of time.</p><h3>Endless user content</h3><p></p><p></p><p>I also like that hentai is well represented here. In addition to pics and videos, the site also hosts a lot of games and comics, and even original content that users made themselves. One of the better places to download games, and there’s even a forum dedicated just to discussing the games if you want to talk about it or ask for help if you get stuck.</p><p></p><p>There are some unique categories you’ll find on PlanetSuzy that are rare to find in other sites. First is adult humor, where you’ll find pics, jokes, and stories that are NSFW. There are also dedicated forums for social media celebrities and celebrity fakes, which I don’t usually find in other places.</p><p></p><p>Speaking of celebrity fakes, have you checked out deepfakes yet? That shit is fire, and it shows it’s only a matter of time before we get perfect porn replications of all the top celebrities. My mouth is watering already.</p><p></p><p>Anyway, there’s also an entire forum dedicated to hairy pussy lovers, which is fucking funny to me for some reason. I don’t like hairy pussies getting caught between my teeth and shit so I stay away from there, but if you like that big old afro bush PlanetSuzy has your back.</p><h3>What I Like</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Of course, I also must mention the ridiculous amount of content. PlanetSuzy is ambitious in how much porn it tries to give you and it handles that responsibility well. What I mean is that if PlanetSuzy just threw at you millions of random porn, you’d be so goddamn lost you’d go limp in confusion. PlanetSuzy organizes its content well, which can be tough on a forum of this size.</p><h3>What I hate</h3><p></p><p></p><p>For example, let’s say there is a thread for fake taboo videos. People will be constantly adding new content to the thread, so the thread will be at the top of the list. But when you go into the thread, the first page will have posts from months ago with broken links.</p><p></p><p>The links can be broken for many reasons. It can be that the file-hosting just got old, or that the moderators decided to block it because it broke some rules. Anyway, it can get annoying when you go into a thread and see pages of broken links.</p><p></p><p>I also think the site sometimes tries to do too much, which is why I said it’s not great for finding specific fetishes. It’ll take you some time even to just read through all the categories. There’s also a shit-ton of rules, so you’ll want to lurk for a bit before you actually start contributing if that’s what you want.</p><h3>Suzy is one awesome broad</h3><h3>One sweet world</h3><p></p><p></p><p>I always wonder who are these people that go through all the effort to share their porn in places like these.

It ain’t uncommon for a porn site, blog, or basically any online endeavor to include a message board, but it’s rarely more than just a little sideshow to the main event. This one’s something of an outlier in that it’s arguably one of the site’s main draws. Hell, I wouldn’t be surprised if some of those forum members are skipping the blog and heading straight for the conversation and all the boobies within.</p><p></p><p>I’ve written about TheFappeningBlog.com here at MissAVDH a time or two, as it’s long held the number one position among the celebrity nude sites on my list of Fappening sites. Even if you’ve never read my review or even heard of me, there’s a good chance you know the joint. They’re one of the original sites specializing in naked famous ladies, and still get a good 22 million visits per month. Today, I’m going to take a nice, long, close and hard look at their <strong>thriving forum of celebrity smut</strong>. I hope I brought enough lube!</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Fapping to the Fappening Forum</h3><p></p><p></p><p>If you’ve ever dipped your toes into one, perhaps hoping for some insight on the women or a little bit of extra porn, you know what a shitshow they can be. I can’t count the lame, hilarious forums I’ve seen with nothing but the occasional post from a sad guy complimenting the pornstars and desperately hoping they’ll read his message and fall in love. Other times, it’s all basement dwellers posting dick pics with the same pathetic goal in mind.</p><p></p><p>TheFappeningBlog’s forum definitely ain’t cut from the same cloth. <strong>This is a legit discussion forum with a fucking ton of activity</strong>. I’m writing this on a Wednesday afternoon and there are over a thousand members online, including around 450 members and more than 600 guests. The full member count is over half a million.</p><p></p><p>They list some Forum Statistics out on the front page, and they’re similarly impressive. As of this writing, they’ve got nearly half a million messages in over 55,000 threads. It’s definitely worth noting here that while The Fappening Blog has been around since 2017, the forum itself has seen some updates and revisions along the way. If I’m reading the numbers right, the current spread of threads and subforums only date back to 2019.</p><p></p><p>That fat number of guests online today hints at the setup of the forum a little bit. Unregistered lurkers don’t congregate in these numbers without something worth gawking at, so yeah, you can view quite a lot of the posts and the content without signing up for an account. That said, full access does require a membership. Without one, you won’t be able to see all the images, and you ain’t going to see the full-size attachments anywhere.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, signup is quick, easy and free. Just offer up the same sacrificial email address you’d give them anywhere else. The verification step today asked me to name a Kardashian whose first name begins with a K, which shouldn’t be too tough if you’ve beaten off to any celebrity nudes in the last couple decades. The confirmation link slid into my DMs in a matter of seconds, and then I was in TheFappeningBlog.com’s forum.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Naked Famous Chicks You Know and Love</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Overall, though, the setup will seem very familiar to anybody who’s visited any type of online discussion board on any topic. The Fappening Forum divides their discussions into a handful of categories like Nude and Sexy Photos and Videos, Models and Community. These sections are further divided into subforums devoted to content types and sources.</p><p></p><p>If you’ve been shaking your dick at your computer screen or iPhone over the last few years, you’ve no doubt noticed the rise of social media porn content. These days, many of the posts at TheFappeningBlog.com have their roots on sites like OnlyFans and Instagram, which also have their own hopping subforums on The Fappening Forum. In fact, their OnlyFans board is one of the busiest, with over a hundred thousand messages in 13k threads.</p><p></p><p>From a porn reviewer and professional masturbator’s perspective, the massive shift in the porn scene has been interesting to watch. It’s also no big surprise to see The Fappening Blog dancing along the edge of this sea change, because they were always a low-key trendsetter in the world of online porn. The Fappening changed the world of celebrity porn in a massive way that can be compared to the shift we’ve seen OnlyFans bringing.</p><p></p><p>You could say The Fappening Forum is ahead of the curve, which is why I was a little surprised by how small their Deepfake Porn board is. It’s only got a few threads, including one lamenting the fact that most of the big AI porn generators specifically ban creating fake celebs. (I’ve reviewed a number of these services on my list of AI Porn Sites, and while that’s often a listed prohibition, many of them seem perfectly capable of breaking their own rules.) On the other hand, their Fake Celebrity Nude and Deepfakes board has decent traffic, with posts today about Elizabeth Olsen and some other famous babes.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Can’t Get Enough Celebrity Nudes?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>I dipped into their Celebrity Nude Photos board, which currently has almost 44 thousand messages. Active threads today include “discussions” on Riley Reid, Gina Barrett, Jennifer Lawrence and Stana Katic. It’s worth mentioning that TheFappeningBlog has an international userbase, which means you ain’t going to be limited to babes who are only famous in the USA.</p><p></p><p>I’ve always been crazy about Jennifer Lawrence, so I checked out her thread. There are nudie screencaps from flicks like Mother, Red Sparrow, No Hard Feelings, and a couple that look like home movies I’ve never seen. They even provide free download links so you can save your favorites for later.</p><p></p><p>There is one small catch, which you already know about if you’re a regular on any porn-sharing message board. TheFappeningBlog doesn’t host any of the videos themselves, so you’ll have to grab the clips from filehost services like Pastebin and Keep2Share. It saves the webmasters on their bandwidth bill, but the end user will run into some small hurdles along the way. Namely, you’ll have to wait for limited downloads at slow speeds. No biggie, especially for free fap fodder.</p><p></p><p>TheFappeningBlog.com looks unassuming as hell considering how popular they are, and what a fantastic source of celebrity nudes they’ve been for years now. The Fappening Forum is a major part of that formula, helping to build a thriving community of fans and photo swappers. Much of the content that hits the front page of the blog is featured on the forum first, so it’s a little like going backstage at a strip club staffed entirely by famous chicks. Who wouldn’t want to be a part of this club?</p>"}},{"id":"cf36e0b71824","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"cf36e0b71824","title":"PornBB","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"PornBB.org is one of the largest free porn forums on the internet you can download free porn videos and pictures here and many different content PornBB has 6 million posts and 3000 users here has a lot of free content for you to browse if you want...","canonical":"https://theporndude.com/zh/38/pornbb","affiliate_url":"https://www.pornbb.org/forum","rating":5,"siteOrder":26,"price":"free","tags":["免费","下载"],"features":["下载"],"categories":[{"id":"best-porn-forums","collection":"categories_en"}],"screenshot_url":"https://cdn.staticstack.net/assets/img/r-thumbs/6ee2a16-pornbb_small.png","image_alt":"PornBB, Porn Forum","scraped_at":"2025-10-28T23:42:16.379Z","iconSpritesheet":"favicon-spritesheet.png","iconPosition":"-368px -0","iconClassName":"icon38","logoIconClass":"icon2064","pros":["everything is free","minimal ads","lots of categories","fresh content every day"],"cons":["torrents don’t appear to be used very often","hard to find specific content","you have to download content, aka, wait to get your jerk on"],"detailedDescription":"<p>Porn BB is a no-bullshit forum where users share all kinds of porno for your fapping pleasure. It has porno movies, celebrity videos, vintage content, JAV bitches, webcam whores, and even virtual reality cockmunchers for you to fap to.</p><p></p><p>PornBB.org is a fucking legend in the porno community. For over ten years, horny men have gathered in this sacred place to share the latest and greatest naked bitches for you to spill your juice to. There are plenty of categories to browse, and if your tastes are a little different, it has hentai, gay, and fetish forums for you to check out too.</p><p></p><p>But this review is about the main forum, PornBB, so let us continue checking out the main site.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>PornBB is a thot - very basic, very pink, and gives you what you ask for</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Don’t worry too much about the ads, they aren’t a huge pain in the ass like a lot of other sites. There are no pop-ups, video ads, or other bullshit. Just a couple of ads at the top and bottom of the forum that you can safely and easily ignore.</p><p></p><p>The main categories include adult movies, model content, pictures, other shit (stories, games, magazines), and general porno discussion. There’s also a community section where you can make friends, but you better fucking evaluate your life if you go to PornBB to make friends and have friendly chats. You got fapping to do, son.</p><p></p><p>If you’ve browsed forums before, you won’t find anything new. The site uses a very standard forum similar to vBulletin, and you’d have to be a fucking retard to get lost in this paradise of porno.</p><p></p><p>Don’t be put off by the pink ass fucking layout. Every fucking thing is pink in this goddamn place, like a 12-year-old girl designed it. I guess it’s supposed to remind you of pussy, but can we tone down the femininity in this place?</p><p></p><p>Either way, PornBB is easy on the eyes, and there’s really nothing much to say outside of it being your standard forum.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Sharing is caring</h3><p></p><p></p><p>The main reason is that there is a lot of fresh and professional content. The XXX Movies section is fucking solid, with dozens of posts every day showing the latest porn videos produced from god knows where. All you have to know is each page has like 30 posts, and every single post is from today.</p><p></p><p>There’s also a broad selection of content here. In addition to XXX videos, we got pictures, celebrities, HD content, webcam, JAV, virtual reality, 3D, and more. The pictures section has its own categories of softcore, hardcore, celebrities, and amateurs.</p><p></p><p>Not into the traditional pictures and videos? No fucking worries my horny friend. The forum has active forums for stories, games, and magazines. This is actually a great place to download magazines and games, because so many other sites that offer these things are filled with ads and other bullshit. I will note that I didn’t see any torrents though.</p><p></p><p>One underrated part of PornBB is the requests section. Let’s say you come across a video or picture where you need more content from the bitch, but you have no idea who she is. Just post her content in “Babe &amp; Video Identification” and let the masses get to work. By far one of the best sources for figuring the name of a girl (or guy).</p><p></p><p>If hentai, homos, or other fetishes are more your liking, you should definitely check out the sister sites. At the top of the page are big ass links to these other three forums, and you will find similarly active and big communities that cater to these topics. It’s nice to know that this place has all your major needs covered.</p><p></p><p>Finally, since this is a forum, I will talk about the community. As you may know, a place like PornBB is very reliant on a strong community, because all the content and discussion come from the community. PornBB has a very active community that goes beyond just the porn. It has a general chat, an introduction forum, and other links to share that really makes you feel part of a community.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>What I Like</h3><p></p><p></p><p>I appreciate that PornBB also reaches out to more obscure content, like games and magazines. This is actually a great place to find adult games, because there is a lot of discussion that lets you decide which ones are good or not. The content is also very up to date, so you won’t find any shitty porno games from the 90s.</p><p></p><p>One of the best things about forums is that there is a natural filtering system. What I mean is, users will naturally comment and discuss more on the good shit, while ignoring the bad shit. What that means for you is that the real good shit that makes you bust a nut quick will be easy to find, since those are the content that have lots of discussions.</p><p></p><p>PornBB also has a clips thread. These are short videos that are much quicker and easier to download than the full-length movies. I like this because I don’t fucking have time to download gigabytes of material just to get my fap on.</p><p></p><p>I also want to mention that PornBB has a pretty damn good search function. I thought it would be shit, but actually, it works really well. If you’re into a specific model or fetish, just type that shit in the search bar at the top. You may be surprised at how many results you get.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>What I hate</h3><p></p><p></p><p>This is why the short clips forum is important. It takes a really patient man to download porno for hours just to get their fap on. At least with the clips, you only have to wait 10-15 minutes to get your meat going.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>No bitch ass color scheme, please</h3><p></p><p></p><p>This is a minor point, but the main logo/graphic could also use some work. It looks like shit and is definitely an artifact from when the site opened over ten years ago. New users may be highly suspicious of this place, looking like it’s from the 90s.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Strength in numbers</h3><p></p><p></p><p>This type of place is slowly going out of fashion as internet speeds continue to improve around the world, allowing horny fuckers to directly stream their content instead of waiting for a download like a jackass. I also largely stopped downloading pictures and videos, and only really tolerate downloads for full-length movies or games.</p><p></p><p>But having said that, downloading videos does have value. Videos you stream will usually be pretty shitty quality, and you definitely won’t be streaming content that takes gigabytes of space. At PornBB, a lot of the content is over a gigabyte and very high quality.</p><p></p><p>There’s also a certain joy in waiting for a movie to finish downloading before you get your fap on. Like hanging out with a bitch all night in anticipation of exploring her sugar walls at the end, downloading content has a similar effect. At least for me.</p><p></p><p>PornBB is a great forum with a huge community, where people give tons of feedback and comments on the content. Just remember, the most important thing isn’t the friends, but the faps we made along the way.</p>"}},{"id":"cfddac69530e","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"cfddac69530e","title":"Phun Forum","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"Phun.org Forum has a largest and most active community of perverts and porn lovers.

It’s not your typical porn location, but you know damn well a site can’t appear on my site if it doesn’t take care of porn. So, yeah, you can look forward to a little bit of everything including plenty of porn, sex and nudity, soft-core and hardcore shit and other random stuff that will keep you thoroughly entertained. And how does interacting with other like-minded pervs appeal to you? How about an opportunity to make your own threads? Then sit your regular-ass down as I take you on a step by step journey of Phun.org Forums as you discover how you can join this happy community of freaks who enjoy sharing all kinds of porn and taking part in some pretty interesting discussions.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>The statistics</h3><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Loads of celebrity fun in the Phun</h3><p></p><p></p><p>I checked one of the posts featuring Pamela Prati and Loredana Romito from a 1988 film called Riflessi Di Luce and was pleased to find over 100 photos showing the two getting intimate in soft-core scenes, showing off their naked bodies, and fucking. Conveniently, there is a download link below each gallery and if you want to add naked celebs in your stash, be my guest.</p><p></p><p>Needless to say, there is more where that came from, and you can check out the celebrity section for more filth that includes forums like celebrity photos, celebrity movies, celebrity videos (soft-core/erotic edition), and celebrity extras among others. Told you these guys are not fucking around.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Plenty of nude models to drool</h3><p></p><p></p><p>The organization in the model section is done in such a way that one of the section is dedicated to sexy and well-known models like Megan Moore, Stormy Daniels, Taya Vais, and Miki Hamano. Then there is the social media model forum that mainly focuses on cyber models, you know, the likes that tease followers with hot bikini snaps on their Instagram and Snapchat among other social media platforms. Here you will come across the likes of Amanda Nicole, Blanca Blanco, Lauren Summer, and Lindsay Pelas, among other Instagram hotties who continue to mesmerize netizens with their near-nude photos.</p><p></p><p>The amateur models forum is perhaps the most surprising as it caters for unknown cuties. With over 11k discussions and 248k+ messages, this place seems to be really popular. The forum has some interesting posts that include hot wives and MILFs, amateur girls with big boobs, pregnant and sexy women, sneak peek photos of upskirts and down blouses and so much more. Fuck, they even have a photo of the day post. No wonder motherfuckers can’t get their asses off this section. I saw one gallery featuring an amateur cutie all naked in the kitchen, and it was a fucking bucket list.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Where the hell is the smut you promised?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>The ‘sexy video section’ is divided into three forums. The first one is called the ‘sexy videos’ (pros) and houses some of the hottest professional porn with the world’s leading professional fuckers featuring heavily. For the context of how interactive this place is, there were over 748k discussions and 1.3m+ messages. The porn covers multiple niches, including exploited college girls, erotic massages, creampies, big asses, oral, and more. Just so you know, taboo or r*pe, whether real or faked, is strictly prohibited. If you want to see your favorite porn stars getting ravaged, this is where you wanna be. Needless to say, none of the vids are hosted here and the links direct to outside sources.</p><p></p><p>But when you have the likes of Legal Porno, Brazzers, Reality Kings, and Dick Drainers as possible destinations, why would you complain?</p><p></p><p>Also, there is a forum solely dedicated to amateur porn, including HD and even better, a place for all the professional XXX videos with a resolution of 720p and above. The collection also spreads across multiple niches and fetishes. You have over 4,310 pages of nothing but absolute filth. Beat that.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>All of this for free?</h3><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Things to love about Phun.org</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Multiple regular updates; Phun.org has thousands of active users who are always contributing content in the forums, and the abundance of new posts is a testament that you can never have a boring day in any of the forums.</p><p></p><p>Lots of adult content; Phun.org is mainly an adult platform, and the majority of the forums cover porn spreading from soft-core to the absolutely hardcore and anything in between. No wonder the site is one of the largest porn forums on the internet.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Possible concerns</h3><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>What I think should be done;</h3><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Wrapping it up</h3><p></p>"}},{"id":"b516e99fdb8f","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"b516e99fdb8f","title":"TitsInTops Forum","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"TitsInTops.com is a forum focusing on pretty women and their seductive tits to watch and share social media tits nude selfies stars and busty actresses","canonical":"https://theporndude.com/zh/5597/titsintops","affiliate_url":"https://titsintops.com/","rating":4,"siteOrder":30,"price":"free","tags":[],"features":[],"categories":[{"id":"best-porn-forums","collection":"categories_en"}],"screenshot_url":"https://cdn.staticstack.net/assets/img/r-thumbs/72fda_titsintops_small.jpg","image_alt":"TitsInTops Forum, Porn Forum","scraped_at":"2025-10-28T23:42:43.401Z","iconSpritesheet":"custom-favicon-spritesheet.png","iconPosition":"-336px -448px","iconClassName":"ctm-icon5597","logoIconClass":"icon5597","pros":["a discussion forum dedicated to titties","familiar interface","thousands upon thousands of booby photos","fresh content all day long","an active community of breast fans"],"cons":["login required to view full-size pics"],"detailedDescription":"<p>Do you like Tits In Tops? If you said “yes,” you passed the test: it turns out you’ve got a pulse. It’s hard not to appreciate a nice pair of jugs, no matter who you are. We’re hardwired to see them as a sign of ripeness and fertility, so any straight dude is likely to pop a raging boner. A woman’s appreciation for another’s flawless breasts is perhaps motivated by kinship as well, while the queers just appreciate good symmetry and presentation.</p><p></p><p>No matter why you enjoy gawking at a lady’s pretty fun-bags, TitsInTops.com has got some good shit to make your morning bus ride a whole lot stickier. <strong>Since 2005, the online forum has provided a place for tata fans to share photos and talk about boobies</strong>. In case you were wondering, the site title isn’t exactly 100% accurate; they’ve also got a ton of beautiful, busty women posing without their tops. A forum ain’t shit if it doesn’t have any perverts connecting and offering up their collections, but it looks like TitInTops has those in droves. They get thousands of visits each and every day, and today your old pal MissAVDH is among them.</p><p></p><h3>Tits in Tops and Out of Them, Too</h3><p></p><p></p><p>If I was talking about another type of site, that ripe old age would probably be a negative mark. XenForo is still being updated, so TitsInTops.com’s interface is fully compatible with the modern browser, but the basic setup? It’s the same old online forum style you know and love, largely unchanged over the years because it just fucking works. If you’ve ever visited a forum before, you’ll feel right at home. If not, you’ll figure it out in about 30 seconds.</p><p></p><p>Depending on their focus, some forums break up into dozens of groups with hundreds of subforums on different but related topics. Since TitsInTops is all about the boobies and not much else, they’ve managed to keep the place from sprawling out of control. You’ll find a streamlined set of about a dozen tit-related subforums, plus the usual rules, help, and off-topic chitchat subs you find on any forum. There’s an Asses and Bootys sub, but it’s only got 600 threads. This is clearly a breast man’s paradise.</p><p></p><p>Before we go any further, I guess it’s worth mentioning that TitsInTops isn’t really worth browsing without registering. Visitors can view any of the threads and use the search function, but you can’t see full-size attachments. Since this whole place exists to share photos, you’re selling yourself really short if you don’t get the full pics. The thumbnails are tiny and automatically cropped into a square.</p><p></p><p>Registration is free and it only takes a few seconds to fill out the form. You do have to wait for a moderator to approve your account, though. I tried with a fake email account first, because I fucking hate spam, and ended up getting my IP address blacklisted immediately. Oops. That’s why they invented VPNs, I guess.</p><p></p><h3>Social Media Sluts and Their Big Jugs</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Friends, this place is a fucking goldmine of titty pics. There’s a sticky thread at the very top with nearly 10,000 replies. If you’ve got some random Facebook pics of a chick with a nice rack, but you don’t know her name, this is where it goes. People usually attach multiple images to each post, so you end up with page after page after page of busty thumbnails leading to busty full-size pics.</p><p></p><p>If you have a problem falling down masturbatory rabbit holes, you may want to schedule the rest of your day off. After spending a few hours perusing the Random Boobies thread and saving a big-ass folder full of favorites, I started cranking it through the rest of TitsInTops.com’s social media board. Even in the middle of the day, there have been half a dozen posts here in the last hour, most of them including pics.</p><p></p><p><strong>The massive userbase at TitsInTop.com ensures a near-constant flow of fresh boobie photos</strong>. Outside of the Social Media area, the last hour has also seen posts in the Busty Amateurs, Free For All, and the Asses and Bootys sections. If you’re tired of beating off to the same Google Image Search strings every day, you’re in for a real fucking treat.</p><p></p><p>Before I left the social media section, I checked out a few threads devoted to different Instathots and Snapchat sluts. Every thread contains a good selection of pics for a different girl, and some of the collections run pretty deep. I think I feel a few new cybercrushes coming on.</p><p></p><h3>Amateur Girlfriends Coming Out of Their Tops</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Another one of TitsInTops.com’s most popular subforums is called Busty Amateurs, and it’s full of some top-shelf sluts showing off some top-shelf titties. There are well over 100,000 messages, and like other subs on the site, most of them have photos attached.</p><p></p><p>Personally, I prefer the Girlfriends and Wives area. With only around 32k posts, it’s not as busy as the other amateur board, but the dudes in there are posting homemade photos of their thick wives, big-titted girlfriends and well-endowed exes. Some of these lucky pervs are smashing some prime poon, and they’re gracious enough to give us a peek.</p><p></p><p>One recurring theme I noticed at TitsInTops was that of full-bodied women. There are skinny girls with amazing tits on the site, sure, but it should come as no surprise to the massive melon fan that they’re often attached to babes with a little extra to hold onto. Some are a little thicc, others are pleasantly plump, and there are more than a few BBWs to shake your dick at. A poll in the General Discussion area got 20 votes from masturbators who prefer lithe beauties, and more than 40 who like ‘em curvy. If your girl is a fatty, the chubby chasers around here might want you to share.</p><p></p><h3>And Some Big Titty Stories, Too</h3><p></p><p></p><p>It’s a pretty fucking diverse mix of stories. One dude talks about a little-boob ginger who got turned on when he wasn’t, and some other deviate is begging for stories about busty girls getting bullied by no-tit bitches.

What’s the best part of playing video games on PC? Is it the incredibly immersive graphics that you display on your 8k monitor? Is it the complex storylines and narrative of your favorite characters? Is it the supreme performance that only a $5000 beast of a machine could accomplish? Fuck no. None of that shit is the best part of a glorious PC experience. It’s the sexy ass mods. I’m talking xrays, nudes, fuckable NPCs, giant titty mods, and all that awesome shit. You can’t do that shit on console. Why even bother playing something like Skyrim if you can’t fuck your housecarl Lydia’s slutty brains out?</p><p></p><p>I know there’s no way you’re playing shit like that for the plot. But it’s not just Skyrim. Games like The Sims, Oblivion, Fallout, and a handful of other awesome games are ripe with kinky mod options just waiting for you to jerk your dick to. But where oh where do you get these awesome mods? There are so many scam sites, so you have to be wary. The last thing you want is a virus fucking your shit up. And most sites with mods don’t even have the sexy ones. Why bother?</p><p></p><h3>Millions of Users Flock Here Every Month for Quality Mods</h3><p></p><p></p><p>When you get right down to it, Loverslab.com is a free forum site. And a damn fine looking one at that. I know when someone mentions forums to me I think about those horrendous sites that looked like they were designed by that “web design” friend who isn’t even fluent in HTML. This site has some class. It’s got a dark theme that launches standard, though if you hate your eyes they have a light theme you can throw up there as well.</p><p></p><h3>Excellent Site Design with a Sleek Dark Theme for Easy Browsing</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Each of those sections has main threads for downloads, discussions, technical support, and more. It’s pretty fucking comprehensive. You don’t have to worry about jumping between different boards and sites to get help or anything like that. Plus, with 13 million visits every month there’s bound to be some helpful fucks online at any given time.</p><p></p><p>I recommend signing up as a registered user if you want to interact with people, which is the entire fucking point. It’s easy. Name, email, verify email and done. Though I will say that during browsing and signing up I was having some issues with my connection to this site. Might have been during some sort of maintenance. I don’t know, but maybe expect slow loading at times.</p><p></p><h3>Incredibly Active Community With Zero Dead Topics</h3><p></p><p></p><p>I should mention that this is hands down the most active forum site I’ve been on in years. Every single topic has replies at least within the past day or so, with most having replies every few minutes. No dead zones of any sort, not even for the older games like Oblivion. Color me impressed. So, you should have no problem finding a place to contribute. Simply click on any of the topics to open up a massive list of recent threads. Most of these sections have thousands of topics and tens of thousands of posts lurking within. The community is very friendly and helpful. You’re not going to get flamed for being new to the site.</p><p></p><h3>Supportive User-Base and Content for Every Fetish</h3><p></p><p></p><p>There are even resources on here for you crafty fucks who like to make mods. There are resource packs, tips, tutorials, guides, and plenty of freaks on here to bounce ideas off of. If you have an idea then you’ve already got thousands of people willing to test that shit for free. There are sections for adult VR mods, which sounds fucking amazing. This place has more tools to help you bust a nut than a seasoned dominatrix’s sex closet.</p><p></p><h3>Surprisingly Great Mobile Experience</h3><p></p><p></p><h3>MissAVDH’s Favorite Features</h3><p></p><p></p><p>You can talk about anything here, too. It’s not just for mod fanatics. You can learn about new and kinky hentai games, fuck around with some forum-based games, share sexy stories, and tons more. It’s a site with a little bit of everything. I’m not even that big on PC modding and I’ll probably be swinging back through here for some of the kinky posts and discussions. I definitely need to add my opinion to the best anime waifu debate.</p><p></p><h3>MissAVDH’s Suggestions</h3><p></p><p></p><h3>MissAVDH’s Final Thoughts</h3><p></p>"}},{"id":"00c5b51ddfb1","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"00c5b51ddfb1","title":"ULMF","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"Do you like adult anime video games and role-playing ULMF.org is an active group of perverts with the same hobbies as you have since 2008.

You know, the standard stuff: missionary, blowjobs, hardcore anal fisting. Most porn fans have a general awareness of hentai, but few have any idea how deep the fandom goes. Newbies to the world of cartoon titties and pixel-game twats can get lost easily. What the hell do you do the first time you find a site like ULMF.org? The site gets a couple million visitors a month but is utterly baffling to a newcomer.</p><p></p><p>ULMF stands for Unofficial LineMarvel Forum, which either makes sense immediately or means absolutely nothing to you. There’s no in-between. You probably found this review trying to figure out what it’s all about, or else you’re one of LineMarvel’s apparently rabid fans, Googling his name in search of another bit of pornographic Flash gold.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>WTF is a ULMF? Who is LineMarvel?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>LineMarvel is the creator of a Flash game called Jungle Girl that came out way back in 2005, a few years before OLMF came online. It’s about the titular Jungle Girl who goes out for a naked jungle walk one day and gets attacked by tentacle monsters.</p><p></p><p>The game is simple and crude in terms of graphics and gameplay. You hit ASD to avoid worm-like tentacles that fuck your pussy, mouth, and ass. When the orgasm meter builds up, you lose, at which point Jungle Girl is shown being restrained and fucked by five tentacles.</p><p></p><p>It’s hard to believe, but this is what put the dude on the map. Perverts went crazy for it and demanded a sequel. Demon Girl came out a few months later. Demon Girl is a more polished variation of the theme, but still pretty crude on every level. You play the titular Demon Girl, trying to avoid extremed sex but getting fucked a lot until you lose, at which point you get fucked harder by more tentacles.</p><p></p><p>Both Jungle Girl and Demon Girl were game-changers because they were side-scrollers. Most hentai games at that point were visual novels. LineMarvel’s games were the kind of extreme action you’d expect from an arcade, albeit one drawn in MS-Paint by your perverted nephew. You can play either one on New Grounds, but honestly they’re not worth your time. (Check out my full review of NewGrounds on MissAVDH, though. There’s some other stuff you’ve got to see.)</p><p></p><p>LineMarvel got famous among a certain demographic of deviant masturbators, who flocked to his website. It turns out the dude was some kind of walking encyclopedia of hentai. People wanted him to make another avoid-sex-until-big-gangbang game, but he seemed to prefer to just talk about comic book vaginas and shit like that.</p><p></p><p>You’re probably wondering why a dude who made a game more than a decade ago still has an unofficial forum dedicated to him. While there’s an active sub-board on ULMF where you can talk about LineMarvel, his hentai, and his blog, it’s no longer the busiest forum on the site. They’ve moved on to newer things.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Perving Out to Hentai Games</h3><p></p><p></p><p>There’s a sub-sub-forum about Hentai Games, but I’m a little more interested in the Games link in the header. If LineMarvel was originally known for his games, shouldn’t ULMF be the source for the same kind of content?</p><p></p><p>Weirdly, there’s only one game here. Maybe the whole section is brand new, because game was uploaded yesterday. The Overview explains it was first released about a year ago, but ULMF just got it.</p><p></p><p>The game is a “life simulation” that lets you play in real cities using the Unreal Engine. There’s supposed to be 3D sex scenes that allow player control without forcing it, enhanced by well-written erotica. A banner at the top says the newest version added femdom, same-sex extreme sex and cum effects.</p><p></p><p>I’m intrigued, but not enough to download a game I just heard of on a forum from Mega or MediaFire. I’m not the kind of guy to take chances; I double-bag it if I see barnacles on a bitch’s clam. I might feel differently if there were more reviews, but nobody has said anything.</p><p></p><p>After being disappointed by the tiny Games section, I realized the Hentai Games forum is chock-full of exactly what I was looking for. ULMF really threw me off with the nonsense link in the header, but hopefully, that’s just some shit they’re working on.</p><p></p><p>Most of the hentai games on ULMF have evolved away from that outdated Flash nonsense. Most are built with RPG Maker, but others are labeled as Text adventures, Sims, and a handful of more obscure styles. The list of games in the forums stretches over a hundred pages deep, so make sure you’ve got the synthetic 18+ schoolgirl vagina all lubed up.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Where’s the Beef Flaps?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>That’s not to say there isn’t any media. There’s plenty of it in the hentai forum, you just have to dig a little to get to it. The games were impressive, but this is kind of a jumbled mess.</p><p></p><p>The non-game hentai media discussion seems like it’s mostly people asking where to find hentai. When people do post things, they’re often zipped up and filed away on sites like Mega.</p><p></p><p>The Media link implies this is something they’re working on. I was curious to see a comic based on Demon Girl, which I saw mentioned on the wiki, and just assumed it’d pop up under Media. I could use that Search bar in the corner, I guess, but there’s other stuff to look at.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Playing With Perverts</h3><p></p><p></p><p>The Role Playing Section has a bunch of sub-forums of people roleplaying different scenarios. There’s a mix of science fiction and fantasy here, with names like Abandon All Hoap, Sci-Fi Multiverse and Smokefish games. The whole thing smells like the panties started coming off at a particularly freaky Dungeons and Dragons session, and I mean that in the best way possible.</p><p></p><p>There’s also a thriving Play By Post section. It’s more role-playing, just played a little bit differently. By post, like it says in the name. There’s a Lewdified Pathfinder area, so pull the D20s off your string of anal dice and let’s slay/fuck some orcs and loot/fuck their corpses.</p><p></p><p>A lot of the sessions read like erotic hentai fan fiction. It makes me wonder how many people aren’t interacting with the site but are still playing at home. I couldn’t even estimate how many thousands of pages of dirty stories are written out in this section of ULMF.</p><p></p><p>ULMF.org’s biggest strength is its strong sense of community. Other sites have hentai games, though maybe not as many. Other sites have better stashes of non-game hentai. What other sites don’t have is a bunch of like-minded gamer perverts, and all the fun you can have you with your freaky online friends.</p>"}},{"id":"0bb7308786b8","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"0bb7308786b8","title":"Undertow Club","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"Undertow.Club is an adult gaming blog with over 100,000 members.

My fans are already fully aware of how fun gaming can be. Besides stroking your man horn, it's all you dip shits get up to. I'm surprised you take breaks to eat, drink, and sleep.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>The Next Level</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Trust me. That is much easier said than done. Transforming from a beta to an alpha is almost impossible. I've only ever seen one man pull it off, but he had to surrender it all to regain everything.</p><p></p><p>There's no way you have the proper constitution for such a life-changing personal journey. But who cares? It's fine as long as adult gaming exists. However, you'll need to grow some talents that best make use of adult video games. How lucky are you guys that I'm here to help?</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Skilled Hands</h3><p></p><p></p><p>I advise you rehearse rubbing your belly with one hand while patting your head with the other. It will help your brain to mentally divide your limbs so they can perform different tasks simultaneously. If any of my readers happen to play instruments or juggle, you'll have a head start on the competition.</p><p></p><p>Once you have the basics down and start to feel comfortable with your hands, you can practice massaging your balls while working the shaft and tip. Beginners will think it impossible, but with the right approach, you can pleasure your wang and fondle your cum creators. Trust me when I say it's worth the effort of learning. Even if you don't play porn games, you'll find room to make use of your new talent.</p><p></p><p>However, there is no better use than jerking off on The Undertow Club. They have a superb collection of porn video games to hone your skills. You may never watch traditional porn again.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Switch Your Slippery</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Cleaning your controller will become a part of your regular routine if you make a habit of beating off on The Undertow Club. Lotion is a grimy bitch. It stains, doesn't rinse off, and barely evaporates, so either exchange that shit for lube or buy a new controller every month for fifty bucks. It's up to you.</p><p></p><p>Some of you dumbasses assume you can pussyfoot around this advice by using your mouse and keyboard instead of a controller. I hate to break it to you, but that's not happening. You won't be able to use your computer at all if you hose down the keyboard and mouse in lube and cum. I don't know about you, but that sounds like a horror movie to me. I can't live without my daily supply of internet porn.</p><p></p><p>Now that you have the basic skillset needed to appreciate erotic games, it's time to acquaint yourself with the scene. Porn gamers are a dedicated crew who don't mess around with their masturbation. These are some of the world's most reliable and committed fap freaks.</p><p></p><p>The best way to ingratiate yourself with porn game society is through blogs. Blogs have always been home to the most faithful porn watchers and meat-beaters. It's where the best of the best share tips and tricks, trade porn and swap war stories.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Riptides and Tropes</h3><p></p><p></p><p>A big part of adult gaming is tropes. Many games include one or more classic tropes that continue to arouse gamers no matter how many times they are used. You can read blog posts on the subject on The Undertow Club, but I'll fill you in on a couple of my favorites right now.</p><p></p><p>One of the most beloved tropes featured in many hentai games is breast expansion. Who doesn't want a bitch's tits to get bigger? It doesn't matter how large they are already. Tits can always get bigger.</p><p></p><p>You'll read about breast expansion often on The Undertow Club. As I'm sure you inferred from the term, breast expansion is when a slut's boobs suddenly start growing, generally due to some magical energy. I wish I had this power in real life. Small tits would be a thing of the past. The world would be on an all-Z-cup diet.</p><p></p><p>More often than not, games that fuck with breast expansion also fuck with body horror. Depending on how you play, a bitch's bones could be broken and reformed, their flesh punctured and burned, or their face disfigured.</p><p></p><p>Another central trope around porn games is giant Amazonian cunts. My fans are already very acquainted with these kinds of cunts. Amazonian beauties are huge sluts with massive muscles capable of ripping your dick off and tossing it into the ocean deep. These bitches only like two things: fucking, and beating dudes up. Death by Snu Snu.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>To Boldly Go</h3><p></p><p></p><p>\"Boldly coming\" doesn't have to involve aliens. It could be about fucking demons, bigfoots, loch ness monsters, chupacabras, ghosts, or mummies. The key is that the bitch isn't human.</p><p></p><p>My readers gave up on fucking humans years ago. Fucking a human woman is so far out of the realm of possibility that fucking a cryptorchid sounds more likely. That's a sad state of affairs.</p><p></p><p>Blogs are only as good as their design. A lot of information is disseminated on blogs, so if the place is chaotic, it can make easy use impossible.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Keeping Things Organized</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Down the right-hand side is a navigational menu to help you get around the place efficiently. It's split into five sections. First up are member links to their Discord accounts. At the time of this review, there were fifty people online. There are plenty of folks to make friends with and swap war stories with.</p><p></p><p>The second section lists all of the members online now. I bet people like Feet Gobbler, Big Futa Balls, and Sticky Fingers 69 have some intelligent shit to say. You might learn something if you listen.</p><p></p><p>The third section is a list of the latest posts on The Undertow Club. This currently includes shit like a list of the Best XXX games, Nude mods for traditional games, and Mod requests.</p><p></p><p>The penultimate section covers the latest resources on The Undertow Club. Right now, I'm looking at a Ruby Dragon mod for EM and a sexy Diablo 4 mod.</p><p></p><p>Last but not least is a block of site statistics. The Undertow Club contains fifteen thousand threads, Two hundred and fifteen thousand messages, One hundred and fifteen thousand members, and the last member to join was Bobo the Hobo.</p><p></p><p>Forums on the front page are split into the Social club and the Rec room. Social Club includes shit like Club announcements, The greeting room, General discussion, a Guest room, and an area to report site problems.</p><p></p><p>The rec room focuses more on gaming and includes Kinks and fetishes, Super deepthroat, Game modding, Game development, Adult and hentai games, Visual art, Fiction, and Roleplay.</p><p></p><p><strong>As you can see, The Undertow Club has everything you fuckers need to expel sperm while playing video games</strong>. You'll love how interactive jerking off to porn games is. The Undertow Club will teach you everything you need to know to maximize your experience.</p><p></p><p>It would be fun if The Undertow Club had a couple of games you could play on-site. I bet members would be happy to support them.</p><p></p><p>You've got a lot of research to do, so I won't stand in your way any longer.</p>"}},{"id":"3062c7a40e74","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"3062c7a40e74","title":"FreeOnes Board","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"Board.FreeOnes.com is FreeOnes Message Board Porn lovers can talk about their favorite porn porn star fetishes and fetishes here for free XXX pictures and videos","canonical":"https://theporndude.com/zh/36/freeones","affiliate_url":"https://board.freeones.com/","rating":4,"siteOrder":35,"price":"free","tags":["免费"],"features":[],"categories":[{"id":"best-porn-forums","collection":"categories_en"}],"screenshot_url":"https://cdn.staticstack.net/assets/img/r-thumbs/386bbf4-freeones_small.png","image_alt":"FreeOnes Board, Porn Forum","scraped_at":"2025-10-28T23:43:13.084Z","iconSpritesheet":"custom-favicon-spritesheet.png","iconPosition":"-112px -0","iconClassName":"ctm-icon36","logoIconClass":"icon36","pros":["porn discussion forum","tons of activity - ~11 million messages and counting","a range of sex- and porn-related discussions","tons and tons of free xxx pics and videos","no registration required to browse"],"cons":["not many download links compared to other forums"],"detailedDescription":"<p>The FreeOnes forum just might be as much fun as the rest of their website, depending on what you’re into. They call themselves the “Ultimate babe site since 1998,” which is more than just an empty brag. Just the fact that they’ve been around since the twentieth century says a lot about the quality of the smut they’re peddling, as do their traffic stats, with close to eight million perverts stopping by last month. A discussion board of any type is only as good as its members, so it’s nice to see a healthy volume of perverts around here.</p><p></p><p>I’ve mentioned FreeOnes.com a time or two here at MissAVDH, as they’re one of the original pornstar databases and a pretty solid source of free masturbatory content. <strong>Their forum is a worthy extension of their brand, offering smut fans a thriving hub of conversation on all things pornographic</strong>. Pretty much all my friends are absolute sexual deviates, porn addicts and compulsive masturbators, so I knew right away I was going to be in good company. Let me tell you all about my visit today.</p><p></p><h3>Chitchat with a Million Likeminded Pervs</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Even though it’s just a minority of users actually posting, they stay busy as hell. As of this writing, <strong>there are over 11 million messages posted by nearly a million members in almost as many threads</strong>. Sometimes I’m really in awe of the internet. A hundred years ago, you’d need a fucking building just to house the pornographic content and conversation contained on this message board alone. Times sure have changed.</p><p></p><p>Visually, the FreeOnes.com forum looks like pretty much any other forum. I do suspect they’ve gone through an occasional upgrade over the decades, though, as they don’t look as crusty as some of the other long-lived sites out there. The color scheme, gradients and overall presentation feel modern enough, but at the end of the day, it’s still a forum. The text-based format hasn’t changed much over the years, and doesn’t require much sparkle to function properly.</p><p></p><h3>What’s the Good Word, and Is It Sexy?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Seems I was painting with too broad a brush. <strong>The FreeOnes.com discussion forum hosts a wide variety of sex- and porn-related conversations</strong>. While you will find a ton of X-rated pics and videos, this isn’t the kind of forum where every post has a Keep2Share link to download a movie. I feel like the setup of the average forum lends itself to collectors looking to settle in for a fap a little later after a download session, while the FreeOnes forum will be of more use to those who are horny right now.</p><p></p><p>The breakdown of Free Ones subforums is a bit different than you find on the typical porn-sharing forums. I think it’s simpler. They’ve got the expected About subs for FAQs, updates, news, help and legal concerns, though there’s very little activity in any of them. There’s also a handful of forums labeled For The Curious, where you’ll find discussions on shemale pornstars and gay porn sites.</p><p></p><p>Most of the activity takes place in a batch of subforums simply labeled FreeOnes. Watch That Video is one of the most popular subforums here, with close to half a million messages in threads with titles like Interracial Lesbian Clips, Pantyhose Ripping, Hairy Women and Anal Penetration. As you’ve probably guessed, the posts consist of porn and discussions about that porn.</p><p></p><p>One of the things that really strikes me about the FreeOnes.com forum is that it really is a genuine discussion board. There’s very little chitchat on the average adult message board, but this place is full of fans and connoisseurs voicing their opinion. A Watch That Video thread on lesbian anal scenes offers not just examples, but recommendations on starlets who perform these types of scenes.</p><p></p><h3>Porn Nerds Almost as Knowledgeable as Myself</h3><p></p><p></p><p>I got curious if anybody had written up a review of my other site, MissAVDHCasting. Nobody has done a full writeup just yet, but I did find some fans writing about my work on the Favorite Babes and Watch That Video boards. There are dozens of messages about MissAVDHCasting, typically containing at least a little bit of content to shake your dick at.</p><p></p><p>The wealth of free content is definitely one of the big draws for the Free Ones forums. While download links are relatively rare compared to elsewhere, almost every post is full of nudie pics and sex videos. Content is often offsite, so you’ll have to follow a link and open a new tab, which shouldn’t be a dealbreaker for anybody but the most OCD weirdos.</p><p></p><p>For example, somebody mentioned my video with Jessica Starling in a thread about titfucks with hands-free finish. The poster included a RedGifs link so you can watch me stuffing my hot dog between her buns until they’re thoroughly sauced. A thread about Sarah Jessie on the Favorite Babes board included a link to her scene on MissAVDHCasting. Even if you haven’t signed up for an account, you still get a 47-second sample of me nailing the gal. Likewise in threads about Savannah Bond, Aria Valenica, Penelope Kay, Coco Lovelock and a bunch of other visitors I’ve had. (What can I say? I’m a stud!)</p><p></p><p>The FreeOnes forum is a hell of a resource for masturbators for a variety of reasons. It’s obviously useful as a smut source if you’re actively cranking off, but I’m also impressed by the sheer volume of actual information you’ll find here. Boards like Porn Scene and Model Requests, as well as Name the Babe, can help fans figure out who their favorite starlets are and find more of that precious masturbatory gold.</p><p></p><p>Case in point, somebody last month was looking for a video they once saw of Little Caprice fucking an old guy. They’d seen GIFs but couldn’t find the full scene anywhere. Their question went unanswered for two weeks, at which point somebody else posted a link to the original video, along with some bad news: the images that had enticed OP in the first place had been doctored, because she doesn’t actually blow a grandpa in the original scene.</p><p></p><p>Free Ones ain’t the only forum where people post questions like this, but it is one of the only ones where the questions actually get answered regularly.

Do you regularly watch pornography? Are you the kind of person who can’t go a day without watching pornography because fapping to internet porn keeps you sane? Do you like to soothe your life’s frustrations by squeezing one out every now and then and getting that good old dose of dopamine that you oh so desperately crave? Well then you sir, are what’s called a serial masturbator and are definitely in need of some help – if you don’t cut out your fap-filled routine of jerking off to overly visually-stimulating internet fuck flicks then you’re destined to end up in the deep end of online porn, and it’s definitely not for the faint of heart.</p><p></p><p>Pornography itself has come a long way from the days of nudie magazines piled up in the very last rafts of gas stations. Back then the most extreme porno would be some girl bent over with her pussy glaring right at you while the hairs are shooting off in every direction (yes, girls were hairy back in the days, fact). Nowadays, there are all kinds of porn-related themes and sub-genres spread across every orifice of the internet – the average porn consumer will definitely be surprised and most likely disgusted at just how extreme pornography has become in the modern day, with people pissing, spitting and shitting all over themselves on various extreme XXX domains on the World Wide Web.</p><p></p><p>Sexuality as a whole has definitely evolved since back then too, so it’s no wonder that pornography has evolved alongside it – now whether or not sexuality was the thing that evolved after pornography or vice versa is probably a conundrum that needs its own separate article, but one thing is for certain; pornography has definitely taken an approach towards various extremes, and a rapid one at that. I’ve seen it evolve with my very own eyes, and I can definitely tell you one undeniable truth about porn right now; It’s as extreme as ever, and there’s definitely more than enough of it to satisfy any caliber of porn consumer, especially with websites like “Extreme-Board”.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Contains All The Stuff You Can’t Find on Popular Porntubes</h3><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Doesn’t Get Hardcore Until Classic Scat Porn Is Involved</h3><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>But It Doesn’t Get More Classic Than BDSM</h3><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>It Only Gets More Brutal</h3><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>And There’s Also The Vanilla Porn Section</h3><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>This is a Forum-Based, Community-Driven Domain</h3><p></p>"}},{"id":"df1c8e52a879","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"df1c8e52a879","title":"XNXX Forum","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"Forum.xnxx.com is a great website where people can share their sexual fantasy and pornographic images with others for free.

Mostly because people have moved on to some more interactive things which include clean user interfaces where you can jump straight to the content without having to browse through an entire post just to get to it. Forums were really popular back when porn sites weren’t a thing because this was the only place where you could actually find some erotic content to jerk off to for free. This means that you were no longer confined to your Playboy magazines and the rest of the physical mediums that you’ve gotten used to at the time. Most forum sites aren’t that active anymore, but there are many out there which are including Forum.xnxx.com.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Community being put first on a porn site</h3><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>So many threads to explore and content to enjoy</h3><p></p><p></p><p>So first of all, you’ve got all these different sections on the website that you can check out.

So, we’ve got a forum on our hands, have we? Well, I’m here to dissect every porn site and that includes adult forums that you might have or might never have heard of. Forum.AdultDVDTalk.com is certainly one of those places that deserves our attention because it’s a fairly massive forum that has a lot of engagement and we’ll see exactly why that is. I mean who even buys porn DVDs these days. A lot of people apparently, I didn’t really expect that if I am to be completely honest with you.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>A huge community that stands at your disposal for all porn movie information</h3><p></p><p></p><p>There’s just so much going on with this website it’s pretty insane. Forum.AdultDVDTalk.com sports over 3.3 million posts in some 215000 topics. I mean just imagine how much that is per every person on the website. That’s a lot of engagement. And we can probably assume that some members are less active than others so that leaves you with a set of people that are just fanatics for porn DVDs that roam around Forum.AdultDVDTalk.com giving you all sorts of useful and free advice.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>The design is lacking as with most porn forums out there</h3><p></p><p></p><p>This one just looks old and ugly. It’s definitely going to be harder to make your porn DVD purchase when you’re all gloomy and sad and possibly asleep from seeing this awful design. I mean just a few sprites here and there wouldn’t hurt, and it’s not like you’ll be fundamentally changing the functionality of the forum either. I know forums follow a strict set of rules with how they’re supposed to function, but nobody said that you can’t put an interesting skin over that, you know.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Maybe the reason behind the old design is the old dudes who watch DVDs</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Forum.AdultDVDTalk.com is for people who buy porn DVDs so immediately we know that we’re dealing with a bit of an older populace here. They certainly don’t like new shit when it comes to change and technology. So that’s one reason, and the second one is probably that the person that made the website just doesn’t want to waste time by updating the looks of it. You know what they say, if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it. I usually agree with this, but I would argue that a shitty design can break the site. Just like a good design can make a site that much better.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Well organized forum will help you find whatever it is you need immediately</h3><p></p><p></p><p>So, if you’re in need of advice when it comes to which DVD you should (or shouldn’t) buy, you can rest assured that you’ll probably find your answers in this section. There are a lot of helpful people out here and a lot of the DVDs and adult movies have already been talked about so you can peep in on the already existing posts and topics, or you can create your own asking about a specific adult movie that perhaps hasn’t been discussed about yet which would obviously be a great addition to Forum.AdultDVDTalk.com, since you might help some other poor bloke figure things out in the future.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Buy, sell, and trade porn DVDs with other members of the community</h3><p></p><p></p><p>If you have made your decision when it comes to purchasing a porn DVD, and need to find where to do it, then this section has all the answers that you seek. Doesn’t matter if you’re looking to buy a used DVD, or if you’re looking to just buy it virtually, or even if you want to buy a completely new edition, it’s all here. Trade it, buy it, do whatever it is you’d do at a flea market, but with the realization that you won’t find much else except for porn in this marketplace, that’s for sure.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>There’s even a section to talk about some non-related topics</h3><p></p><p></p><p>I’d say that Forum.AdultDVDTalk.com is a great website for all discussions surrounding the purchasing and watching of porn and adult movies, as well as just generally any kind of porno that you have to pay for on the internet. Whatever it is that you’re looking to buy, you can definitely expect a lot of helpful analysis on this website, coupled with many friendly faces that are looking to help out a brother in need.

Some people would say if you’ve never heard of 4chan, you should consider yourself lucky. Well, that’s not really the kind of company we keep around here. I know you’re a pervert, just like me, and you like seeing the weirdest, freakiest, sexiest and nastiest shit out there. That’s one of the 4chan’s big claims to fame.</p><p></p><p>The site has been around since 2004 and has had its share of controversies. I’ll touch on that a bit, but there’s always Wikipedia if you need the full history lesson. I’m MissAVDH, so I’m going to focus on the porn stuff.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>The Asshole of the Internet</h3><p></p><p></p><p>The site is a giant set of message boards about different subjects. They’re technically an “image-based bulletin board”, or imageboard. Posting images with or in lieu of texts is encouraged.</p><p></p><p>4chan is an American site, but moot, the dude who started it, was really into Japanese shit. There are boards on 4chan dedicated to Anime and Manga, Mecha, and even one devoted to Pokemon. There’s also a Hentai board, if you prefer your anime bitches with tentacles up their twats.</p><p></p><p>If you’re not into Japanese culture, you could always dig into Sports, Science and Math, or Literature. There’s a pretty wide range. What do you like? Music? Auto? My Little Pony?</p><p></p><p>Actually, I know what you like. There’s a whole Adult subset of imageboards: Sexy Beautiful Women, Hardcore, Adult Cartoons, and about a dozen others. That’s where you’ll find all the dirty stuff you’re looking for.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Who Are You? I’m Nobody</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Look, I know what kind of freaks read this website. You heard the whole place is anonymous and your perverted mind is thinking of all the different kinds of freaky shit you could do and see in a place like that. You’re entirely right, too.</p><p></p><p>The Random board, also called /b/, regularly has discussions about taboo. Actually, they usually call it wtaboo. You won’t believe the shit people are willing to cop to when everybody is a stranger. Granted, most of it is probably made up, but it’s hotter than most of the shit on erotic story sites.</p><p></p><p>Honestly, /b/ is where a ton of the action on 4chan is. Anything goes here, so half of it is boring as hell, but the whole thing is really fast-paced. Scroll the down the page once and by the time you refresh, you’ll have a whole new set of shit to look at.</p><p></p><p>I’m a big fan of the /b/ threads where people share social media pics of their hot sisters, wives, and co-workers. Do you know what’s even better, though? Pics You Aren’t Supposed To Share threads. /b/tards serve up their exes and currents in all their naked glory.</p><p></p><p>In the spirit of sharing, the stoners like to show off the fat nugs they’re smoking this evening, and the elaborate glass pieces they’re doing it with. You’ll also find threads detailing problems getting laid, unrelenting cuckold fantasies, and furry threads for the fans of dog-person anal scenes. Strangers are so accepting!</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Anonymous Trolls, Anonymous Freaks</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Even though you’re “anonymous”, your IP address is still being recorded. If you try to use 4chan to do any illegal shit, you’ll still get arrested and will potentially get ass-fucked for decades in prison. It ain’t worth it.</p><p></p><p>That said, the anonymous posting style of the website has lead to some interesting shit. You know that hacker group, Anonymous, that sometimes makes the news? I’m talking about the dudes in the Guy Fawkes masks like V for Vendetta.</p><p></p><p>You’ll notice the name field on 4chan posts defaults to “anonymous”. You win a free Internet if you put two and two together and figured out where Anonymous originated.</p><p></p><p>There have also been some darker incidents where people confessed to murders or posted to 4chan before committing them. As I said, anonymity can turn people into fucking idiots. Keep your head on straight and just use it to do regular pervert shit.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Let’s Do Pervert Shit</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Fortunately, there are other 4chan boards that serve up porn with a much lower chance of simulated torture gifs mixed into the pile. Sexy Beautiful Women, or /s/, is a board full of Sexy Beautiful Women.</p><p></p><p>The posts on /s/ are curated, so less free-flowing and wild than on /b/. They don’t even want you to start a thread unless you have a bunch of sexy photos that share a theme. Right now, there’s a thread of disabled women, another of babes in pantyhose and tights, one of hot Black girls, and another of bitches using toys. I’m saving a bunch of images from the “girls whose pussies salivate during the photo shoot” thread.</p><p></p><p>Whether you actually get off to hentai or not, it’s worth taking a look at /h/, 4chan’s Hentai board. There’s a thread right now where everybody is sharing their favorite pics. I see a squirting 18+ schoolgirl, a stepbrother/stepsister footjob, and a little catgirl getting boned.</p><p></p><p>If you download porn torrents, /t/ has what you need. There are a few cartoons mixed in, but it’s mostly sex movies. Like elsewhere on 4chan, you’ll see a lot of trannies, or traps as they’re called here. Bailey Jay is everywhere on 4chan, as are discussions about whether sucking her dick would make you a \"fag\".</p><p></p><p>/gif/, the Adult GIF board, is hit or miss. I thought it was going to be a bunch of porn GIFs, and it is mostly sex stuff. There is a great thread of big-booty amateur White teens, one with girls cumming, and another full of blowjobs in public. The board gets dark with a thread of people getting beaten up, and another of people getting killed.</p><p></p><p>The main thing that sets 4chan apart from other giant Internet message boards is the fact that everybody is anonymous. It gives the whole place a Wild West atmosphere where basically everything goes. That means you’ll get sexy and intimate shit people would never otherwise share, but you’ll also get people’s ugliest unfiltered thoughts.</p><p></p><p>There’s enough action across 4chan’s different imageboards that you’ll always find some interesting shit to look at or pull your pud to. Be careful, because gross shit may be mixed in with the smut. That’s the risk of a place like this. 4chan definitely isn’t for general audiences, but MissAVDH readers may appreciate an occasional poke into the Asshole of the Internet.</p>"}},{"id":"d9712c24c8e2","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"d9712c24c8e2","title":"Sexy And Funny Forums","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"Forums.sexyandfunny.com is a great forum site full of funny videos hot editing and interesting discussions and amateur hot girls.

These sites thrived even when other porn sites were first coming out. Why? Well, connections weren’t great back then. It was easier to watch a gif of some hot bitches tits bouncing on a forum than it was to try and load an entire video on shitty, dialup internet service.</p><p></p><p>They’ve been on a bit of a decline lately, but that doesn’t mean there aren’t still some great forum sites out there. Like acid wash jeans. Most chicks look fugly in them now, but then you spy that dimepiece wearing a pair with an ass that has its own gravitational field and maybe, just maybe you could see that style coming back.</p><p></p><p>I found a forum that’s still going pretty strong compared to the other sites like it. Most of them have a trickle of followers that struggles to break 100 thousand every month. Forums.sexandfunny.com blows that figure out of the water and is killing it with well over 4 million site visits every month. I can’t say for certain when they launched, but I’ve spied posts dating as far back as 2005. So, this isn’t some new forum site that doesn’t know shit. These guys have been around for a solid minute.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Site is Open for Registration and Has a Large, Active User Base</h3><p></p><p></p><p>For once, I get the honor of reviewing a forum that is actually open for registration. Give an email, username, and the other standard stuff to get started. From there you can add small details to your profile. I recommend signing up. This isn’t an anonymous message board. You won’t be able to post pictures of thick bitches without signing up. So, unless you plan to lurk, I would sign up. It’s free.</p><p></p><p>At the top of the page, in comically small text, is a header with options for forum rules, home, shop, tutorials, and the best posts of the day. Best posts are determined by votes or “rep.” Basically, if you like something you can rep it and give that user some brownie points. The more points you have the higher your social rank on the site get and the more likely people will be to listen to whatever bullshit you have to say.</p><p></p><p>I’d check out the rules before you get started. You don’t want to get banned because you were a dumbass who couldn’t be bothered to skim a page of basic rules. The shop has t-shirts if you feel like rocking the site logo and name across your chest for some reason.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Browse Posts, Play Flash Games or Head Over to the Casino</h3><p></p><p></p><p>The arcade/casino probably caught your attention. It sure got mine. Flash games. This site actually has some fucking flash games. They aren’t all sex-themed, actually, most aren’t. You can play games here and fight for the top spots on the leaderboard amongst all the other cucks on the site. In the casino, you can bet fake cash and play a variety of card games. Neat, I guess. Didn’t expect to see that sort of content here.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Sexy Threads Full of Amateur Sluts</h3><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Porn is Weirdly Scattered Amongst Other Threads</h3><p></p><p></p><p>This is more of a general forum with a touch of porn in it, which was a bit of a bummer for me. It left me wanting for more. I wanted to see dedicated sections for sharing clips, pics, and animations of hot porn videos. You can find those threads, but you might be better off fapping to another, more porn focused, porn forum if you’re just looking to bust a nut. I’m sure there’s plenty of kinky content to jerk it to on here, but having to go through the effort of finding tags or skimming through posts to get it isn’t worth it.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Poor Mobile Experience</h3><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>MissAVDH’s Favorite Features</h3><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>MissAVDH’s Suggestions</h3><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>MissAVDH’s Final Thoughts</h3><p></p>"}},{"id":"e1320759dce7","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"e1320759dce7","title":"JAV Forum","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"JAVForum.com is a somewhat new porn forum that brings together a host of English-speaking JAV porn lovers to discuss various Japanese porn topics","canonical":"https://theporndude.com/zh/15146/javforum","affiliate_url":"https://www.jav-forum.com/","rating":4,"siteOrder":42,"price":"free","tags":[],"features":[],"categories":[{"id":"best-porn-forums","collection":"categories_en"}],"screenshot_url":"https://cdn.staticstack.net/assets/img/r-thumbs/aa9a6ec-javforum_small.png","image_alt":"JAV Forum, Porn Forum","scraped_at":"2025-10-28T23:43:56.806Z","iconSpritesheet":"custom-favicon-spritesheet.png","iconPosition":"-256px -736px","iconClassName":"ctm-icon15146","logoIconClass":"icon15146","pros":["a somewhat new forum that has already built a thriving user base of jav porn fans","the forum topics within are all worth exploring and offer great value to the reader","it has a thread dedicated to ai-powered software that can de-mosaic censored porn"],"cons":["the forum could be better with an optimized about page in the main menu"],"detailedDescription":"<p>For countless porn fans around the world, the discovery of the JAV (Japanese Adult Video) industry is a game changer. This is especially true if you’re one of the many porn fans who have burned through the world of Western porn and watched every piece of smut it has to offer. In turn, they end up seeing new and exciting climes of porn that will keep their minds engaged.</p><p></p><p>To say that JAV porn often ticks all of these boxes and more is an understatement. The good people of Japan have some truly filthy imaginations, and this often shines through in their porn productions in ways you never thought possible. Yep, entering the world of Japanese porn is a true sexual rollercoaster ride that brings with it all new niches and a throbbing range of new adult stars to explore.</p><p></p><p>However, it’s not all roses. The harsh reality is that Japan is a country where English isn’t widely spoken, and this can quickly be seen in their porn productions. Trying to find out critical information about your new favorite Japanese pornstar or XXX niche can quickly become a nightmare that leads to a dead end.</p><p></p><p>So, what’s the answer? The good news is that you’re not alone. There are plenty of JAV porn enthusiasts outside of Japan, and many of them have set up dedicated adult forums to discuss everything and anything about the world of Japanese Adult Video. The bad news? Some of them are an utter fuckin’ shitshow!</p><p></p><p>I’ve been in JAV porn forums that feel like a virtual, porn-themed Battle of Iwo Jima, where the participants spend most of their time arguing over porn rather than engaging in creative discussions that help each other out. That’s why I decided to step in and help you out and start reviewing them to ensure you get balls-deep in the right forums and not bogged down in the shitty ones.</p><p></p><p>Up for review today is JAV-forum.com.

Still, our mission is to find out whether it’s able to deliver on its domain name by providing a non-Japanese audience with a solid insight into the world of JAV porn and helping them navigate it like someone who was born in the heart of Tokyo Red Light District!</p><p></p><p>Now, let’s begin!</p><p></p><p></p><h3>What is JAV-forum.com?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>A quick background check of JAV-forum.com tells us that the site was set up around 2023, and since then, it has clearly become a pretty active hub of porn chatter. At the time of writing, JAV-forum.com was approaching 4,000 members and was home to over 620 threads packed with over 6,300 messages. Next, let’s see what people are talking about within!</p><p></p><p></p><h3>What Kind of JAV Info Can You Find on JAV-forum.com?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>● Japanese Fetish Discussions - If you’re one of the many people who isn’t used to Japanese porn, then you’ll quickly find your mind blown by the kind of fetishes that seem out of this world. They’re the kind of kinks and quirks that you’d struggle to find in the world of Western porn, and the Japanese are often so damn creative that they can keep the most experienced JAV enthusiasts on their toes. In this section of JAV-forum.com, site members come together to discuss their favorite Japanese fetishes, new kinks found in Japanese porn flicks, and all of that good stuff. Overall, this can be a great way to discover new niches of JAV porn.</p><p>● JAV Idols - Keeping up to speed with the latest pornstars in the non-Japanese adult industry can be a mammoth task. However, things are a lot harder in the world of JAV porn because there’s a massive flood of Japanese pornstars (locally known as Idols) and all of the information to go with them. However, this dedicated section of JAV-forum.com is a great place to be if you're keen to keep up with the latest news, updates, and facts about some of the most prominent JAV Idols on the scene. It’s also an excellent spot to find out about some of the more underrated Japanese sluts finding their feet in the industry.</p><p>● Movie/Actress Identification - When it comes to naming and organizing their porn releases, the Japanese do things a little differently to those in the West. This means that finding out the exact name of a Japanese pornstar or the scene she is starring in can be a ballache if you’re doing it alone. That’s where this section of JAV-forum.com comes in to help because it’s home to a chunk of JAV porn fans who dedicate their time to identifying some of the hottest Japanese Adult Video scenes to ensure that their fellow Asian porn enthusiasts don’t get left in the dark about a particular scene or star who has made their dick/pussy tingle.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>The Design of the Japanese Porn Forum</h3><p></p><p></p><p>JAV-forum.com is laid out on a light gray and white background and starts with a header section home to an eye-catching logo, a main menu, and a search bar. The logo spells out the site’s name in orange, accompanied by a gorgeous graphic of a Hentai girl in a white bra.</p><p></p><p>The main menu is simple and directs you to the site’s homepage, a drop-down menu of the forum topics, and a menu showcasing the latest additions to the site. This then paves the way to the main homepage of JAV-forum.com itself.</p><p></p><p>JAV-forum.com is divided into two sections on the homepage. The first lists all of the forum's main sections: Forum, general, JAV, subtitles, and sexy girls. Each forum section has a title and a description of its contents. There’s also a real-time ticker showing the number of threads and messages contained within each section and a synopsis showing the latest user to have posted in the thread.</p><p></p><p>The second part of the homepage is a sidebar showcasing the latest forum posts. It's followed by a ticker showing forum statistics such as members, threads, messages, etc., and a share button lets you spread the word about JAV-forum.com on different social media platforms.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>What I Like Most About it</h3><p></p><p></p><p>A decent forum is only as good as the posts to be found within it, and it’s fair to say that JAV-forum.com is packed with a solid range of beneficial posts that can be of use to both veteran and newbie Japanese porn enthusiasts alike. Whether you want to find out the name of a particularly filthy JAV scene that has enticed your cock or uncover some little-known facts about your favorite Japanese porn idol, the folks in this forum can have you covered.</p><p></p><p>One of the most significant downsides to JAV porn is the fact that much of it is censored between the thighs. So I was overjoyed to see that JAV-forum.com has deployed AI technology to allow its non-Japanese users to find out about the places where they can de-mosaic their favorite Japanese porn and see the uncensored version. Nice!</p><p></p><p></p><h3>What I Don’t Like</h3><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Suggestions I Have for JAV-forum.com</h3><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p></p>"}},{"id":"42fd98a9b941","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"42fd98a9b941","title":"OnlyStans","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"OnlyStans.me is more than just a forum It is also a mature digital cult for men who love all kinds of obscene content whether you are here to find leaked information obsessed with your favorite OF models or do deeper on the best lighting for ass photos...","canonical":"https://theporndude.com/zh/20655/onlystans","affiliate_url":"https://onlystans.me/","rating":4,"siteOrder":45,"price":"free","tags":[],"features":[],"categories":[{"id":"best-porn-forums","collection":"categories_en"}],"screenshot_url":"https://cdn.staticstack.net/assets/img/r-thumbs/d317a55-onlystans_small.png","image_alt":"OnlyStans, Porn Forum","scraped_at":"2025-10-28T23:44:12.657Z","iconSpritesheet":"custom-favicon-spritesheet.png","iconPosition":"-80px -912px","iconClassName":"ctm-icon20655","logoIconClass":"icon20655","pros":["a simp sanctuary","variety of content and discussions"],"cons":["nothing"],"detailedDescription":"<p>Only Stans! Isn’t this exactly what every single one of us depraved little creatures dreams of? You sit there, pants around your ankles, sweating like a pig in a sauna, typing “OnlyFans content” into Google for the hundredth time, hoping today’s the day you strike gold. Well, guess what? OnlyStans.me might just be your ticket to the promised land. No guarantees, though, so don’t start jerking it in celebration just yet. Most of the content here is just people desperately begging for OF content like some unhinged goblin whispering, “Please, just one crumb of ass.” But if you dig deep enough—hard enough—you might just get lucky. Think of it like mining for gold, except instead of gold, it’s some chick’s private stash of tit pics that she thought were locked behind a paywall.</p><p></p><p>I’m not saying you shouldn’t support your favorite models. Hey, if you’ve got the cash, by all means, throw your dollars at them like you’re a sugar daddy on a budget. But let’s be real—not everyone can afford to drop $30 a month just to see some chick in a thong when the entire internet is drowning in free porn. So, what’s a broke, horny degenerate to do? Enter OnlyStans.me, a beacon of hope in a world that constantly tells you to “pay up” if you want a peek at the goods. It’s a forum built by the people, for the people—where everyone is united under one single, noble cause: to beat their meat without breaking the bank.</p><p></p><p>The best part? The thrill of the hunt. You can’t just waltz in and expect premium content to be handed to you on a silver platter. No, my friend, this is a battlefield. You’ll have to wade through pages of requests, sift through clickbait posts, and endure some absolute wastelands of garbage before you find that sweet, sweet payoff. It’s the internet’s version of hide and seek, except instead of looking for your childhood friend behind a couch, you’re looking for some dude’s pirated collection of Bella Thorne’s nudes. And when you do find it? Oh, that rush. That adrenaline. It’s better than Christmas morning.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>A Simp’s Paradise</h3><p></p><p></p><p>It’s basically a simp’s dream come true. Here, you’re not just some lonely weirdo hoarding thirst traps in the darkness of your camera roll—you’re an active participant in the grand tradition of online worship. Have a picture set that you’ve been using to fuel your darkest urges? Toss it up in the forum. Got a legendary bikini shot that never fails to get the blood pumping? Share it with the brotherhood. Your devotion will not go unnoticed.</p><p></p><p>But before you go on a posting spree, let’s set some ground rules. This isn’t some lawless wasteland (even though it damn well feels like it sometimes). There’s an Instagram section for IG pics, a TikTok section for TikTok thirst traps, and, of course, an XXX/Porn section for the holy grail of filth. You wouldn’t dump your cat videos in the middle of a cooking forum, would you? (Actually, knowing some of you, maybe you would.) Point is, post in the right damn place unless you want the mods to treat you like the human equivalent of expired milk.</p><p></p><p>The best part? This is a place where simping is celebrated, not ridiculed. Nobody here is going to judge you for knowing an OF girl’s entire posting schedule better than your own work shifts. Nobody is going to call you a loser for having strong, emotional opinions about which angle shows her tits the best. Here, you are among your people. It’s a beautiful, unholy brotherhood of men who just want to admire the finest digital flesh the internet has to offer.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>The Cult of Degeneracy</h3><p></p><p></p><p>There’s a general chat section where you can talk about anything—porn, life, the existential dread that hits after you’ve nutted for the third time in an hour. Then there’s the OnlyFans model discussions, where you can debate the truly important questions, like “Is this chick actually worth subscribing to, or is she just posting the same five recycled nudes?” It’s like Rotten Tomatoes, but instead of movie reviews, it’s guys arguing over whether a girl’s content is worth $15 a month.</p><p></p><p>But wait—there’s more. If you think this site is just for straight dudes looking for titty content, think again. OnlyStans.me caters to all flavors of perversion. There’s a section for camgirls, because sometimes you want to throw a few bucks at a chick who’ll actually acknowledge your existence. There’s a transgender section, for those who appreciate variety in their smut. And then—because the internet is nothing if not deeply, deeply weird—there’s an anime section. Because apparently, you need that too.</p><p></p><p>And don’t even get me started on the tips and advice section. You wouldn’t think a forum dedicated to porn would be a place for genuine self-improvement, yet here we are. Need help figuring out which OnlyFans models are worth the money? Someone’s already made a spreadsheet. Wondering how to avoid getting scammed? The community has detailed survival guides like it’s some kind of OnlyFans apocalypse prepper forum. I mean, Jesus Christ, these guys have done more research on OnlyFans scams than the FBI has on actual crimes.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Your One-Stop Shop For Everything</h3><p></p><p></p><p>What does that mean for you? It means you don’t have to fap alone anymore. Well, technically, you’re still going to be alone when you do it (unless you’ve got some questionable hobbies), but mentally? You’re part of a tribe. A brotherhood. A collective of like-minded, hard-dicked warriors all striving toward the same goal: access to the finest selection of online thirst traps known to man. And the best part? You don’t have to do much to get in on the action. Signing up is easy as hell—you can do it the old-school way with your email, or if you’re too lazy to even do that, just log in with Reddit or Google and get straight to the good stuff.</p><p></p><p>Once you’re in, the world is yours. Ever wanted a database of your favorite Instagram models’ spiciest pics, conveniently compiled and sorted so you never have to go on a wild goose chase again? Boom, done. Craving some high-quality discussions about OnlyFans models, where men come together to weigh the pros and cons of different girls like it’s some kind of smut-based stock market? Got that too. Hell, there’s even a section dedicated to general chat, where you can stop pretending to be a respectable human being and just let your freak flag fly. Because let’s face it, where else are you gonna go to have an intellectual conversation about the best angles for an ass shot? Certainly not Twitter.</p><p></p><p>And look, we both know you’re going to come back to this site. You can lie to yourself all you want, tell yourself you’re just here to “check it out,” but let’s be real. Once you experience the convenience, the camaraderie, and the sheer level of depravity available at your fingertips, you’re hooked. So do yourself a favor and bookmark that shit right now. No more wasting time trying to remember what the hell the website was called. No more losing your best fap sources to the abyss of forgotten browser history. Be smart. Prepare for the future. This is your new home now.</p>"}},{"id":"93590ee3afd3","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"93590ee3afd3","title":"NWorship","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"NWorship.com is a veteran sex forum centered on interracial sex.

You know exactly what I'm talking about, and you can't sit there and deny the fact that you've found yourself becoming embroiled in a porn watching session for hours on end and becoming hypnotised by the filthy combinations on your screen that are nothing short of being pure XXX art!</p><p></p><p>Whether it's the glorious image of a pair of dramatically huge pleaser heels bouncing around in mid air as a 12 inch cock slams into the pretty wet cunt of the woman wearing them or the glorious sight of 29 loads of semen dripping down the face of a woman that is already caked in ruined make up, there's so many gloriously aesthetic sights and sounds to be enjoyed in the world of porn that it can be hard to keep up!</p><p></p><p>But I know that all of you are probably sitting there and wondering why I haven't mentioned one of the most powerful aesthetic forms of filth that exists in this world, but just chill out because I'm getting there, alright? Yep, it's time to talk about the glorious sight of interracial sex that often sees some of the most gigantic BBCs you've ever seen in your life sliding bareback into pretty pink pussies with some of them most gorgeous contrasting colours you've ever been lucky enough to witness before.</p><p></p><p>Still, did you know that there are two different types of people who enjoy interracial porn? First, some simply watch it in their goon sessions and do nothing more than appreciate the glorious aesthetics to be found within. On the other hand, some people take their love of interracial sex out into the real world, often with cuckolding, hotwifing, and sissification running flawlessly alongside!</p><p></p><p>Does the latter kind of lifestyle sound like something that you have always dreamed of being a dirty little part of? If so, it's also worth pointing out that this is the kind of lifestyle that shouldn't be taken lightly, and it's a good idea to go into it prepared for everything that is going to come your way. Many people will tell you that this is where interracial sex forums like Nworship.com can play a vital role, and I'm here to find out whether that's true!</p><p></p><p></p><h3>What is Nworship.com?</h3><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>What's the Interracial Sex Forum Like on Nworship.com?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>1. Double Chocolate For a White Wife While the Hubby Watches - This first bit of content to be found within Nworship.com is a gorgeous amateur interracial sex tape that shows two muscular black studs roasting a brunette Russian girl while her white husband stands to the side with his hands obediently behind his back and his useless slim cock locked inside a chastity cage. These black bulls take no mercy on this Russian slut’s eager holes and, judging from the layer of sexual sweat caking her body from head to toe, you can pretty much assume that they've been fucking for hours on end. They show no sign of stopping any time soon, though, because they're enjoying fucking this white bitch in front of her subservient husband far too much, and one can probably go ahead and assume that they're gonna dump loads of hot sperm into her mouth and her pussy at the end, too!</p><p>2. Beta Cucks Show Off Their White Wives - Now this is a particular forum thread that I love on Nworship.com because it's a dedicated space where husbands can consensually show off pictures of their white wives. The latter of whom are often looking for BBC to ride while the former watches. The content within is absolutely glorious, with everything from pictures of white pussies before and after they've been obliterated by BBC to images of black dick loving married women who have the QoS symbol tattooed on their asscheeks to invite black lovers deep inside of their butt hole and pussy!</p><p>3. Big Blonde Seeks BBC - And last but not least, we jump into the section of Nworship.com that is dedicated to people posting advertisements to meet up for casual sex, and this one is posted by a BBW woman in the UK who boasts about having long blonde hair, blue eyes, and who gets very lonely when her white husband is away. She is keen to fill the void, so to speak, and is inviting any local black men to come over and plough her white BBW pussy and breed her like crazy. Form an orderly queue, fellas!</p><p></p><p></p><h3>The Design of the Forum</h3><p></p><p></p><p>After this, Nworship.com then divides itself into two sections, with the first being a vertical list of all of the different categories of discussions that can be found, ranging from alternative sex and sissies to straight and bisexual, and everything in between. The other part is a right-hand side bar which shows you how many members are currently online, the latest posts to have been added to the site, forum statistics, and a link to the official Telegram channel.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>What I Like Most About it</h3><p></p><p></p><p>I also love how Nworship.com really shines a light on the beating heart of the interracial sex community from Germany and the UK to Italy and the United States. My particular favourite was the place where cucked husbands come to show off their proudly dick obsessed white wives who are looking for BBC to stick into their holes!</p><p></p><p>Not only is the design of Nworship.com making the platform really easy to use and navigate but I also found that the site isn't shy about showing you an insight into what goes on with inside of the threads without demanding you sign up as a member first as the latter is something that a lot of other sex forums often tend to do so this makes a nice change!</p><p></p><p></p><h3>What I Don’t Like</h3><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Suggestions I Have for Nworship.com</h3><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p></p>"}},{"id":"139dd5fef97a","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"139dd5fef97a","title":"SocialMediaGirls Forum","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"Forums.Socialmediagirls.com is the best place to get a lot of obscene content featuring your favorite social media actresses, whether it’s blowjobs for your boyfriend or showing your private parts, these girls love to be on camera when they’re not making family friendly content...","canonical":"https://theporndude.com/zh/6177/socialmediagirlsforum","affiliate_url":"https://forums.socialmediagirls.com/","rating":4,"siteOrder":90,"price":"free","tags":[],"features":[],"categories":[{"id":"onlyfans-porn-sites","collection":"categories_en"},{"id":"best-porn-forums","collection":"categories_en"}],"screenshot_url":"https://cdn.staticstack.net/assets/img/r-thumbs/6944ca7-socialmediagirlsforum_small.png","image_alt":"SocialMediaGirls Forum, OnlyFans Nude Website","scraped_at":"2025-10-28T19:36:51.276Z","iconSpritesheet":"default","logoIconClass":"icon662","pros":["top tier content","endless supply of smut","it’s all free","a lot of hard-working perverts"],"cons":["a bit hard to browse through"],"detailedDescription":"<p>Have you ever watched a YouTube video that got so raunchy that you just couldn’t help but rub one-off really quick to some random babe’s side-boob? Don’t lie to me; we’ve all been there. Besides, all the famous YouTubers these days are practically pushing porn on the damn platform. And sure, they have to skirt around the no-nudity rule, but that doesn’t stop them from making some hot ass shit. Hell, Belle Delphine marketed her fucking OnlyFans on YouTube. And yes, it eventually got taken down, but that’s just because it racked up the views. There are tons of lesser entertainers out there who make all kinds of fantastic fap-worthy shit that you should be jerking off to, especially if you prefer some more softcore, tease-oriented smut.</p><p></p><p>If this sounds like your cup of tea, I’ve found the website for you. The forums over at SocialMediaGirls are the place to be. If you’re the kind of guy who stalks chicks’ accounts trying to find bikini shots to fap to, then you’ve found your next bookmark. Forums.SocialMediaGirls.Com should be your next destination. This is a smut den of many super-active perverts who scour all the popular social media and video sites trying to find content to jerk off to. They don’t stop there, either. They talk to each other and work hard to catalog this shit so you can fap easier. They make entire collections of softcore smut for perverts across the globe. They’re doing God’s work.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>The Popular Categories</h3><p></p><p></p><p>I guess that’s what it comes down to – how fuckable the bitches are. After YouTube, you’ll see Instagram, then a smattering of random popular sites like TikTok, Periscope, Live Me, YouNow, and the like. The posters are really covering their spread here. Pro-tip, check out Periscope. For some reason, there are tons of perfect whores there. If you’re looking for the kind of bitches who have no chill, the type of bitches who shove shampoo bottles up their asses, this is where you’ll find them. This site is a fucking godsend. I especially love the fact that there’s no real preference for one single site. All that matters is finding the absolute best pussies from around the globe.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>The Kinds of Smut</h3><p></p><p></p><p>And when I say real, I mean real, as in, not staged. 99.9% of the smut on this site is actual amateur fucking. For the longest time, the word amateur used to refer to smut that’s trying to look realistic, but it was all still professional-grade pornography. I hate that shit. I don’t like pretending that the smut I’m watching is something that I know it isn’t. It’s insulting to my intelligence. So, if you’re like me and you appreciate actual amateur pornography made by young lovers in the comfort of their homes, you’ll love this fucking forum. Social media girls are real girls. They have real jobs. And most of all, their thirst for cock is real.</p><p></p><p>They might be profiting off of this smut in one way or another, but the passion for the cock is real. Don’t get it twisted; most of these girls are genuine whores. Pornstars are different because those get paid to fake it.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>How it Works</h3><p></p><p></p><p>The various posts across various threads are mostly people sharing links to specific chicks and discussing what they want to keep an eye on in the future. Some ask questions about particular chicks that may or may not have sexy content out there. They’re curious, and they want to see if anyone else is too. It’s a well-oiled machine that works towards finding the most fap-worthy content from social media babes. I sometimes look at how amazingly well these kinds of porn forums run and wonder what it would be like if these same perverts ran governments. They’d do a better job than politicians, that’s for damn sure.</p><p></p><p>Anyways, the links that they post are all external since the forum itself doesn’t support video hosting. It makes sense to me. Offering unlimited video posting on a forum site is a sure-fire way to set the damn thing on fire and guarantee that it crumbles to the ground. Luckily, the sites that they use for uploading the videos are pretty much free across the board. There will be a premium link here and there, once in a while, but for the most part, they use video sharing sites and not file sharing sites. The difference is, on video sharing sites, you can watch the video immediately. You don’t have to wait an hour for it to download or whatever.</p><p></p><p>So, in other words, even though SocialMediaGirls’ forum is a bulletin board, it functions as a tube fap station, thanks to the external links. You’re going to have a great time on this website. I can guarantee that much.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>It’s Fucking Fantastic</h3><p></p><p></p><p>You get all of your favorite smut in one place. That’s why I recommend that you check this place out. And sure, it can be a bit annoying to browse through smut across a textual forum. I know. But, the format works. Also, it encourages people to come back and post more content. That’s sort of the point.</p><p></p><p>People keep coming back to this place to share more smut because they feel welcome. They’re hanging out, chatting about their favorite pussy, and generally having a good time. If you’ve got a lot of time to kill, you could consider befriending these perverts and posting your own smut. It’s a great way to make like-minded friends you can share smut with. Go wild.</p>"}},{"id":"0db3386223f5","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"0db3386223f5","title":"xBunker","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"xBunker is a place to get content on OnlyFansTikTok and other websites!","canonical":"https://theporndude.com/zh/8064/xbunker","affiliate_url":"https://xbunker.nu/","rating":4,"siteOrder":91,"price":"free","tags":[],"features":[],"categories":[{"id":"onlyfans-porn-sites","collection":"categories_en"},{"id":"best-porn-forums","collection":"categories_en"}],"screenshot_url":"https://cdn.staticstack.net/assets/img/r-thumbs/ff3000f-xbunker_small.png","image_alt":"xBunker, OnlyFans nude website","scraped_at":"2025-10-28T19:36:57.755Z","iconSpritesheet":"default","logoIconClass":"icon1038","pros":["over 685,000 members","browse content from social platforms, including tiktok, and more","new content posted regularly","sexy as hell content that will get you off"],"cons":["nothing"],"detailedDescription":"<p>xBunker is a platform where you can enjoy all kinds of social media pornography. Here, you will find an abundance of XXX content, allowing you to blow your load to a variety of material from your favorite social platforms.</p><p></p><p>So whether you love looking at gals on Twitch or masturbating to camgirls, chicks from ManyVids, or other types of platforms, xBunker has just what you are fucking looking for. Take a look at all of the content the forum has available for your horny ass and get off to the kind of content that you crave the most!</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Over 685,000 members</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, far too many XXX forums out there leave much to be desired. They do not have the user base you have come to expect when looking for porn that will get you off. And well, we all know that any kind of porn site lives and dies based on the number of people who submit content to the site and use the site regularly. When the number of users that frequent a porn site – whether we are referring to a forum or otherwise – is small and insignificant, this can seriously hurt how the overall porn site functions.</p><p></p><p>xBunker is a forum that can really put a damper on the situation. And considering that so many people no longer visit forums, thinking that the platform does not have that many people visiting, to begin with, wouldn’t be far-fetched. Well, you’d be dead wrong!</p><p></p><p>I say that because, currently, xBunker has over 685,000 registered members on the platform, which is fucking amazing when you think about it! And considering that there are over 10,220 threads and over 70,200 messages available for you to browse and look through, it’s a fantastic achievement in and of itself, especially for a porn site that is essentially a fucking forum that isn’t precisely modern by today’s standards.</p><p></p><p>I can understand why one would feel that forums belong to the past, but you would be doing yourself a disservice not checking this site out. Even though forums are fucking out of date as hell, the reason for visiting this porn site is the same as it is for every goddamn porn site: you want to jerk off to hot as hell pornography. So if you are coming just for the content and could care less about the fucking layout of the forum, you will be pleased with everything you find on xBunker .</p><p></p><p>Besides, by normal standards, xBunker is a user-friendly porn site. So you will not have any kinds of problems finding the type of content that will get you the fuck off, especially if you are a dude that appreciates social media pornography from your favorite social platforms. Trust me; the content is hot as hell. Head over to xBunker and see what kind of content they have in store for you!</p><p></p><p>But before we dive balls deep into the porn featured across platforms like Twitch, OnlyFans, and more, we need to check out the smaller, unique sections on xBunker. I am talking specifically about the various camgirl content, and the like. The truth is that one can easily disregard these sections. But if you take your time to explore them, you may just fucking cum your brains out from the hot as hell content featured in those sections.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>The ‘Other’ section shows you Camgirls, and more</h3><p></p><p></p><p>However, you can browse all of the content posted in ‘other.’ The content you find in the ‘other’ section is from camgirls, Mygirlfund, and more. It’s sort of a ‘best of the rest’ section on the forum, and it’s worth browsing if you want to see absolutely everything.</p><p></p><p>As I was looking around in this section, I noticed that new submissions were added all the fucking time. Each listing has a tag that tells you a bit of the category or genre of the porn that you can find within. And as I was looking through the threads on ‘normal,’ I found a couple of them showcasing 18+ teens, sexy bitches from Twitter, cosplaying Asians, and so much more.</p><p></p><p>Other threads didn’t have tags. Such a thread is one devoted to guys that love armpits. Or a thread that is all about the women from Naked News. See, I told you that the ‘other’ section had the ‘best of the rest’ here! There are over eight pages of threads in the ‘other’ section. So while it isn’t nearly as much content as you will find in the other sections, it is still worth exploring and perusing if you want to see a little bit of everything on xBunker.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Look at social media porn pertaining to favorite platforms</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Get over yourself already! Head over to xBunker and look through all of the platforms that feature tons of porn waiting for you to jerk off to. I noticed that just about every fucking day, there were new threads posted to each section devoted to a specific platform. You can see the latest activity on the right side of each thread to see which sections have the most recent activity. Then again, you will notice that there is constant activity in each nudes section of the forum.</p><p></p><p>But which threads/platforms have the most activity? Well, Instagram, OnlyFans, and TikTok seem to be the most prevalent social platforms on the site. Though, I will say that the Patreon section is also pretty fucking active.</p><p></p><p>If you want to see the very latest activity on xBunker, look to the right of the homepage. There’s the ‘latest posts’ section which shows the freshest posts across the entire forum. And to get a sense as to which threads have the most activity on xBunker, the ‘latest posts’ section will show you in real-time where the members are flocking to in droves.</p><p></p><p>With new posts every fucking hour, the ability to request new content, the option to browse trending threads, and a forum that is overall active as fuck, you are going to be in for a fucking treat whenever you browse xBunker. It’s fucking awesome, though there’s still room for improvement.</p><p></p><p>Some sections – specifically the celebrities and deepfakes sections – need more content. Paige VanZant is essentially the only good thing about the celebrities’ section, and if you want to look at her OnlyFans material, it’s available. Beyond that, though, expect a variety of content that will have you cumming in your pants every time you visit! Good luck and happy jizzing!</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Suggestions</h3><p></p>"}}]

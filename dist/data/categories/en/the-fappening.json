When I first saw the link, aznude.com, I thought it might have been an all Asian porn site. It didn’t take me long to figure out, however, that I was way off. It’s not AZN nudes, but, instead, AZ nudes, as in nudes from A-Z. Hey, I would have been happy either way.</p><p></p><h3>Dressed to Impress</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Scroll below the newsfeed banner and you will find a greeting from the site: “Find huge and comprehensive collection of nude celebrity images and videos FOR FREE. Newest videos will be found in the playlist below. Just click play and enjoy.” Okay, so now the site makes a little more sense to me. Not only is Az Nude an A-Z database of nude images and videos, but AZ Nude is also an A-Z database of nude celebrity images and videos. Ah, now I get it.</p><p></p><h3>Who Doesn’t Love Naked Celebrities?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Aznude.com is a hell of a lot more organized and easier to navigate compared to other nude celebrity sites I’ve seen. On the top of the page, you have your A-Z search bar—just click on “S,” for example, and be taken to a list of celebrities whose names start with “S.” To be more specific, you’ll be taken to a list of celebrities whose first names start with “S.” Warning: there are 120 pages of them, so if you’re looking for Sandra Bullock, you’re probably better off just searching her name.</p><p></p><p>Each femme fatale featured on the site has her own profile and user rating. Her profile will have all the content Aznude has on her. Feel free to rate your favorite (or least favorite) celebs too. Katie Perry, for some reason, had a rating of 4 stars, which I felt to be way too high for her, so I made sure to vote her 1 star to try and bring her rating back down to reality a little bit.</p><p></p><p>In addition to browsing the site by celebrity name, you can also search by movie title. This is actually very convenient. How many times have you been watching a movie, seen a hot little thing in some hot and steamy scene, and did not know who she was, or how to find more of her? Well, worry not, on Az Nude, just search the movie and find images and videos of all the nude and sex scenes that are in it. Problem solved.</p><p></p><h3>Porn Stars are Celebrities Too…</h3><p></p><p></p><p>As far as their real porn goes, don’t expect to find the latest premium scenes in-full, but I was impressed by how up to date they were with their content, even if all they offer are clips. A portion of Rebecca Volpetti’s, “The Farmer’s Daughter,” for example, is on there, and Brazzers just released that like last week. Aznude even keeps up with celebrity Instagram and Snapchat stories. They are so current, it’s amazing. They are kind of like Huffpost, but for perverts.</p><p></p><h3>No Fakes, No Tributes, No Porn Music Videos</h3><p></p><p></p><p>On Aznude, you also don’t have to worry about being duped by lookalike videos or Porn Music Videos (you know, those videos people make where they cut back and forth between hardcore porn scenes and, say, an Ariana Grande music video…okay, now that I’m typing it out, maybe those aren’t so bad…). You can sit back and fap away knowing that you are, without a doubt, fapping to the real Miley Cyrus and not to the off-brand Miley May (who, for you Miley Cyrus fans out there, is actually pretty hot and looks quite a bit like her).</p><p></p><h3>The Invasion of the Ads!</h3><p></p><p></p><p>The most fucking annoying part about the website, though, are the goddamned pop-up ads that create a new tab every fucking time you click on something. Aznude doesn’t even load what you clicked on when these ads pop up, which is the absolute least they could do!</p><p></p><p>Nope, instead, they make you go and manually exit out of the new tab they created for you and come back to their page and click the link again. You literally have to click on everything on the website twice before you can access it. What kind of donkey dick horseshit is that? Fuck those ads, for real. My computer probably fucking has digital herpes now. Great.</p><p></p><h3>Cheers and Jeers</h3><p></p>"}},{"id":"557a30ab4b7b","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"557a30ab4b7b","title":"TheFappeningBlog","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"TheFappeningBlog.com also known as TheFappening.soThe Fappening Blog is the earliest celebrity leaking nude content website on the Internet to watch the illegal leaking content here from the earliest classic content...","canonical":"https://theporndude.com/zh/1013/thefappeningblog","affiliate_url":"https://thefappeningblog.com/","rating":5,"siteOrder":2,"price":"free","tags":[],"features":[],"categories":[{"id":"the-fappening","collection":"categories_en"}],"screenshot_url":"https://cdn.staticstack.net/assets/img/r-thumbs/e276648-thefappeningblog_small.png","image_alt":"TheFappeningBlog, nude photo website","scraped_at":"2025-10-28T17:10:25.072Z","iconSpritesheet":"favicon-spritesheet.png","iconPosition":"-240px -400px","iconClassName":"icon1013","logoIconClass":"icon1929","pros":["free celebrity photo blog","a wide, international range of beautiful famous women","thousands of galleries and videos","dozens of posts added daily","draws material from a wide variety of sources","thriving forum"],"cons":["unwieldy index","lots of non-nude pics labeled as nudes"],"detailedDescription":"<p>The Fappening Blog is arguably one of the most popular blogs on the internet, even if most people ain’t bringing it up over dinner with the fam. They get close to 25 million visits every month, putting such famous brands as Gawker, Engadget and LifeHacker to shame. What could be the secret to their popularity? Honestly, it ain’t complicated at all, but I bet you already knew that.</p><p></p><p>Just in case you only got on the internet for the first time and haven’t heard yet, <strong>TheFappeningBlog.com is one of the web’s best sources for free celebrity nudes and sexy photos</strong>. The current version of the blog has been around since 2017, though the site’s actually a few years older than that. Some of you may remember the initial explosion of celebrity sex pics around the same time, and if the blog’s any indication, those naughty photos never stopped coming—and neither have I!</p><h3>Fapping to The Fappening Blog</h3><p></p><p></p><p>The brand recognition is no doubt a huge part of their traffic formula, but having a well-known name will only carry you so far. (Just ask any of the wannabes who’ve tried to rip off MissAVDH with copycat titles and lame, generic mascots!) The real draw here ain’t the domain name and it sure as hell ain’t that barebones layout. Really, it's all about the women.</p><p></p><p>If you’ve ever seen a blog before, you know how TheFappeningBlog is laid out. Every front-page post has a little blurb and a photo, each of which leads to a full gallery of the lovely famous lady in question. <strong>They’ve featured a very wide, international range of beautiful, well-known women</strong>.</p><p></p><p>I had to toss “international” into that last paragraph because Americans often get confused about the existence of a world outside the US. Looking at the front page right now, I see fresh galleries of American chicks like Chloe Grace Moretz, Victoria Justice, Brooke Shields and Kylie Jenner. They’re interspersed between knockouts like Leonore Capell (Germany), Ruby O. Fee (Costa Rica), Carolina Cardoso (Austria) and Olga Katysheva (Russia).</p><h3>Who’s Who in the World of Celebrity Nudes</h3><p></p><p></p><p>I saw Gigi Hadid (Aaliyahhadid) near the top of the list and gave her a click. That gave me quick access to the small handful of Gigi galleries TheFappeningBlog has posted since she started blowing up the internet. They’re not huge; the smallest current Gigi gallery is just half a dozen pics, while the largest is only 18.</p><p></p><p>The no-frills layout is deceptive, because you might not guess how deep this thing stretches when you actually get in there and start poking around. The Fappening Blog has thousands of galleries in the library, and they’re still building the hell out of it.</p><p></p><p>I’m proud of my own blog here at MissAVDH, but between reviewing adult websites and banging pornstars on MissAVDHCasting couch, I don’t have time to update it nearly as much as TheFappeningBlog. Very few blogs update as much as these guys, who add dozens of fresh posts every day. Every single post contains photos and/or videos, giving you ample reason to include the blog on your daily masturbatory rounds.</p><h3>An Even Better Fap Than Netflix</h3><p></p><p></p><p><strong>TheFappeningBlog.com is drawing material from a wide range of sources</strong>. Other Jenna galleries have featured Instagram pics, red carpet shots, promo stills and magazine covers. I found another post with her full Hot Ones interview, the video embedded from YouTube, as well as an Insta reel where she shows off some new shoes and those stunning legs. There’s also a nice, fat gallery of photos from the 29th Annual Screen Actors Guild Awards, with 79 pics of the Wednesday actress.</p><p></p><p>She’s an absolutely gorgeous babe and talented thespian, and The Fappening Blog’s got a beautiful stash of her pics. As a professional masturbator, porn stud and smut reviewer, though, I couldn’t help thinking something was missing. Namely, the naked boobies and butts.</p><p></p><p>Over the years, TheFappeningBlog’s focus has shifted a bit. They used to specialize only in celebrity nudes, sex pics and the occasional naughty video, but these days, it’s a more diverse smattering of material. They do stick to the sexiest shots they can find of famous women, but not all of these babes have appeared nude on camera. At least, not that we know of.</p><p></p><p>The softer content wouldn’t be an issue in and of itself, but they’ve also got a lot of misleading labeling. The page title for the full index of Jenna posts is called Jenna Ortega Nude, and the most recent post about her is titled Jenna Ortega Nude and Sexy Collection. She’s sexy as fuck, to be sure, but she clearly ain’t naked.</p><h3>Show Me All the Famous Naked Babes</h3><p></p><p></p><p>I think they’re just tossing around the “nude” label to pull traffic, regardless of whether or not the celeb in question has nudes on the internet. That’s a pain in the ass for obvious reasons, and a pain in the balls if you’re trying to whack off right now. I wish there was an easy way to tell who was nude and who wasn’t on the site. Perhaps a separate tag or even just a little asterisk on the naked (18+)girls among TheFappeningBlog’s List page would do the trick.</p><p></p><p>While the main section of The Fappening Blog labels everyone as nude, the forum gets a little more specific. In fact, there are conversations going on right now about whether actresses have ever appeared without their clothes on. Somebody started a thread recently about Emilia Clarke, posting a topless photo and asking if it was really her.</p><p></p><p><strong>The Fappening Forum is even more active than The Fappening Blog</strong>, making it an excellent resource for celebrity nudes even before they hit the main page. I’m reviewing this on a Monday afternoon, and there are over a thousand members online, chitchatting about famous chicks and swapping pics.</p><p></p><p>At this point, TheFappeningBlog.com is practically an internet institution. There’s nothing flashy or fancy about it, but they’ve earned a reputation for themselves as one of the go-to sites for celebrity nudes, sexy photos and wank-worthy videos. The thriving forum is just another illustration of what has made the site so popular over the years, because how many porn sites can you name with a community this strong? Even if you ain’t interested in the gossip or the banter, The Fappening Blog is a fucking goldmine of beautiful famous women looking hot enough to shake your dick at. Try not to get kicked out of Starbucks while you’re at it.</p>"}},{"id":"797664a41501","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"797664a41501","title":"Celeb Jihad","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"CelebJihad.com Some of you may have heard of CelebJihad and you didn't see it from a list of porn sites but from some news reports How can a porn site appear in news reports so often?","canonical":"https://theporndude.com/zh/1969/celebjihad","affiliate_url":"https://celebjihad.com/","rating":4,"siteOrder":3,"price":"free","tags":[],"features":[],"categories":[{"id":"the-fappening","collection":"categories_en"}],"screenshot_url":"https://cdn.staticstack.net/assets/img/r-thumbs/cbd6131-celebjihad_small.png","image_alt":"Celeb Jihad, nude photo website","scraped_at":"2025-10-28T17:10:31.008Z","iconSpritesheet":"favicon-spritesheet.png","iconPosition":"-16px -736px","iconClassName":"icon1969","logoIconClass":"icon1969","pros":["lots of celebrities","some of the satire is pretty funny","a few videos are okay"],"cons":["even shittier web design"],"detailedDescription":"<p>CelebJihad?

Yeah, you fuckers know that I look at a lot of weird and whacky smut, but Celebrity Jihad is something completely different. Sound too good to be true? Well, keep reading to find out.</p><p></p><h3>Smut Combined with Satire?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>“CelebJihad.com is not a pornographic website, at least officially. However, this Website contains adult content which may include images, text, sounds, and videos of a sexually-explicit nature and are intended for a mature audience, by visiting this website, you understand that the subject matter contained herein may concern matters of sexuality.\"</p><p></p><p>Yeah, way to skirt around what you actually are. Blog section or no, if you’re posting enough hours of porn to last a hospice patient a lifetime, you’re a fucking porn site.</p><p></p><p>Anyway, there are a lot of in-depth satire and opinion pieces on the blog section, but to understand you have to follow the character that the writer (or writers) who upload blog posts, and this part of the site is actually a little amusing.</p><p></p><p>As the name might suggest, CelebJihad is a “not-porn porn-ish site”, which has been made by Islamic fundamentalists.</p><p></p><p>In all seriousness or at least as close as I can be, the author(s) knows how to churn out off-color content.</p><p></p><p>Kind of like someone else I know. ;)</p><p></p><p>Assuming you can navigate the site to the blog section (more on the web design later), if you scroll through the site's blog posts, you’ll find ranting and raving posts which sound exactly like something you’d here Osama and his buds bitching about in the caves of Afghanistan.</p><p></p><p>For instance, one article I found reviewed the first Harry Potter movie, Durka writes about the glorification of paganism and even \"perverse sexuality.\"</p><p></p><p>(If you don’t know what that is, it’s just as fucking creepy as it sounds.)</p><p></p><p>So, yeah. Whoever runs CelebJihad really likes to rip the piss out of radical religious types and write up a few good jokes, too.</p><p></p><h3>Celebrity Gossip Columns</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Apparently, in an attempt to elevate themselves from being just another digital gossip rag, CelebJihad's disclaimer says…</p><p></p><p>“CelebJihad.com is a satirical website containing published rumors, speculation, assumptions, opinions, fiction as well as factual information. Information on this site may or may not be true and is not meant to be taken as fact. Celeb Jihad’s owner makes no warranty as to the validity of any claims.”</p><p></p><p>So outside of the occasionally funny satire and there is some content with nudes (more on that later), much of the rest of the written content doesn’t really have any useful information, isn’t funny, or have anything sexy to read or look at.</p><p></p><p>What a fucking waste of time!</p><p></p><p>So to sum up, the blog section is hit or miss, and the rest of the site is crap at best.</p><p></p><h3>Decent Basic Video Content…</h3><p></p><p></p><p>To give you an idea, you can see soft-core, grainy footage of Paris Hilton's second sex tape. There are also compilations of pictures and videos of celebrities in sexy scenes like Emilia Clarke’s nude and simulated sex scenes from Game of Thrones.</p><p></p><p>It’s not bad, but you can get the same stuff elsewhere and for much better quality.</p><p></p><p>Oh yeah, there’s also a bunch of stupid photoshopped stuff depicting certain celebrities doing all kinds of dirty things. If you’re into decent digitally altered pictures, you might like it, but I’m not really into it.</p><p></p><p>To be honest, this kind of stuff is just weak wank material.</p><p></p><h3>…But There’s Porn…</h3><p></p><p></p><h3>…And Shitty Web Design</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Well, that might be an exaggeration, but the way the site is set up is super sloppy. Trying to find specific videos or celebrities is easy, but that’s about the only thing done well. The layout sucks, there are no preview thumbnails, and finding the quality blogs are a pain in the ass.</p><p></p><p>On top of that, damn near every time you click on a link, the page opens up into a new window, and the original tab switches over to a cam site or some other stupid spam.</p><p></p><p>My firewalls are pretty good, so I don’t have to worry about my computer getting infected. But I bet that someone who has only basic malware protection could get their machine fucked up after only cruising around the site for a few minutes.</p><p></p><h3>Responses to CelebJihad</h3><p></p><p></p><h3>Summing Up the Site</h3><p></p><p></p><p>On top of that, the jackass who runs this site, don't even own up to be pornographers.

Do you want to see social media influencers naked at SexyYoutubers? With the rise of social media and the popularity of sites like Youtube that allow people to become “internet famous,” there has also been an increase in the number of sexy chicks who are in the public eye. There are now tons of hot Youtube personalities, Instagram models, Twitch streamers, private Snapchat accounts, Patron girls, and sites like Only Fans that let you subscribe to girls’ pages for a monthly fee in order to view exclusive pictures and videos of them either scantily clad, fully nude, or rubbing their pussies for you.</p><p></p><p>The internet, among all of the good that it has done for us fanatical fappers, has provided a whole new tier of celebrity. Which means, of course, that it has also offered us a whole new tier of celebrity nudes to drain our cocks to. I’m talking Sexy Youtubers like Jenna Marbles and Anna Zapala, droves of beautiful girls who use Youtube as a medium to post wildly popular ASMR videos of them creating soothing, relaxing noises that some people have a near-orgasmic reaction to.</p><p></p><p>Personally, I’ve always wanted to bang Jenna Marbles. God, she is so sexy. Although there haven’t been any sex tapes or masturbation photos of her (yet), Sexy Youtubers does have a bunch of really sexy photos of her in lingerie and tiny little short-shorts for me to enjoy in the meantime. Now whenever I stumble upon her stuff on Youtube, I have a whole new dimension of viewing to enjoy. Once you’ve seen a girl nude (or at least mostly nude), it becomes infinitely easier to picture her as such in any situation from that point on.</p><p></p><p>Although there aren’t nearly as many sites dedicated to naughty pics and videos of social media personalities (I believe some people have started referring to them as ‘influencers,’ which seems accurate enough, seeing as they are pretty good at influencing me to cum) as there are celebrity sites, there are still a handful to choose from. And, as is the case anytime there is more than one site of a particular type on the web, some are going to be much better than others. That being said, let’s take a look at how Sexy Youtubers stacks up.</p><h3>Awesome, Minimalist Site Design</h3><p></p><p></p><p>At the top of the page, you’ll find a centered logo and menu bar. In what appears to be Times New Roman font, the logo bears the name of the site; underneath it is a brief description in a much smaller font which reads, “The home of Hot and Sexy Youtubers. Nudes. Nipple Slips. Bikini Pictures and More!” The site’s title and subtitle as a whole also function as a convenient “home” button when clicked.</p><h3>Professional Layout</h3><p></p><p></p><p>As far as this menu bar goes (save for maybe the games link), I’d say that it’s fairly helpful. It definitely gets the job done and allows you to navigate the site easily and conveniently without much confusion. The only gripe I do have here (and, admittedly, it is a small one) is that the term “categories” seems to be used somewhat freely. I’m talking about their “Main Categories” and “Popular Categories” sections. It seems to me as if one is actually a list of categories (the stuff in “Popular Categories”) and the other is something else.</p><p></p><p>Maybe, just to avoid any possible confusion, I would refer to this section as ‘Sources’ or “Girls.” Again, not a big deal … I know I’m being a little nitpicky. But, hey, that’s kind of my job.</p><p></p><p>The site’s layout reminds me a little bit of a news site, with the main ‘articles’ (or, in this case, posts of girls) slightly left-justified, and links and references to the right, so that as you scroll down the main content, you also find new lists and sections to check out in the process. To the right of the main posts (which take the form of giant thumbnails and a brief description/tagging), you’ll find a list of the entire directory of girls that Sexy Youtubers has posts of (“All Social Media Girls), as well as a few additional links to a couple of cam sites and some free porn sites (hentai, amateur, reviews, tubes, etc.). Overall, a very convenient and straightforward site layout.</p><h3>Slips, and Pics</h3><h3>Time to Kill the Buzz</h3><p></p><p></p><p>The ads on Sexy Youtubers aren’t even small, negligible, or non-invasive either. They are all over the site; right under the menu bar, to the right of the articles on the home page, to the right of the content when you click into it. There are even popups that open new tabs and windows. Plus, many of the ads move and feature solo dicks mid-fap—definitely not what I’m trying to see when I look at porn. This is just un-fucking-acceptable as far as I’m concerned. It is, contrary to popular belief, possible (and not so difficult, actually) to have an ad-free porn site that doesn’t charge (just look at mine).</p><p></p><p>Speaking of my site, however, Sexy Youtubers does link to MissAVDH.com. So, even though their ads are really fucking annoying, this does cushion the blow a little bit (at least they have good taste).</p><p></p><p>All in all, if you are looking for an easy to use, well-designed site with tons of photos, videos, and sex tapes of the internet girls you know and love, Sexy Youtubers is a great place to do it. You’ll have to put up with some annoying ads, sure, but maybe they’ll eventually come around to the idea of taking them down … Until then, happy fapping, and good luck on the never-ending hunt of pussy pics.</p>"}},{"id":"ab91636b8846","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"ab91636b8846","title":"CelebGate","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"Celeb.Gate.cc Whenever you feel a little slutty and want to watch lewd pictures and videos of celebrities, you should think of celeb.gate.cc This website is full of such content.

I remember the first time I visited celeb.gate.cc, their design and overall presentation was pure shit, which made me quite sad, since who does not want to see some hot naked pictures of celebrities? Well, today, their design has completely changed, for the better, and while I think that they could have made a darker layout instead of pure white, I can’t complain since their content is fucking hot.</p><p></p><p>When it comes to the content CelebGate has to offer, it really does not matter if you prefer videos, galleries, or just specific shit, because who could resist watching the images and clips of hot celebrities who did not know that their shit will go viral? The site also states that these are the banned videos of celebrities, and I am sure that you will love this place as much as I fucking do.</p><p></p><p>Everything is already straight-forward, but I am here to explain all the shit I explored and saw, just to make the browsing easier for you lazy fuckers. Honestly, I do not mind talking about such things, since searching for new, legit, porn places online is actually my hobby. This is why when I say that a site is worth a visit, you better fucking believe that it is.</p><p></p><p>The homepage is made in a very simple way, and if you look on the right side, you can see what the site has to say about themselves. I always read this section, just to see if they are idiots who enjoy lying to the audience, or if they are actually genuine. Honestly, while they do have a description on the side, they do not really say anything special; even if that shit was not there, all that was said was already implied.</p><p></p><p>Now, the first thing that made me cringe when I visited this shit, is the fact that you cannot really see anything unless you create an account. I do not know about you, but creating an account on a site that I am not even fucking sure if it is legit or not is quite bullshit. Lucky for you, I am here to check it out beforehand, and tell you all about this place.</p><p></p><p>The only shit you are allowed to do as a non-member is browsing the celebrities who do have something naughty here. You can open their profile, where they will have their fucking bio written, for I do not know what reason. I mean, writing the bio of a pornstar is understandable since most of us do not know much about those bitches… but why the fuck would I need to see a bio of an existing celebrity.</p><p></p><p>You have the fucking Wiki for that shit, there is no reason to list their bio here. Besides that, you can see some of her other details, such as her birth, birthplace, as well as the number of videos, pictures and content she has, and that is currently on the site. The pictures you can open without a problem, but for the clips and content, you should create an actual account.</p><p></p><p>Keep in mind that the videos suggested on this site are not all home sex tapes and all that crap, which is probably the shit we all thought about at first. Some of these videos include naked or sex scenes from their movies and nothing else, and the same shit applies to pictures. Of course, there is a special section for the clips as well, otherwise, I would probably not even suggest this place.</p><p></p><p>The registration process is simple, and if you intend to browse the shit here quite often, then I really do suggest you create an account. On top of Celeb Gate, there are a couple of ways to list the shit here, as well as some other options I will mention now. For example, you have a special Blog page, that should be self-explanatory.</p><p></p><p>In the Blog section, you can read posts, news, and stories about crap from celebrities, which I honestly do not know why you would. Who gives a shit about the story behind it, we all came here to watch some content and not read erotica. However, if you are interested in this, you should know that such a section does exist.</p><p></p><p>There is also a section called ‘The Fappening’, which will show beautiful celebrities who are masturbating. Everything about this section, what it offers, and what you can expect is all listed on that page. So if you are interested, you should check it out yourself, because if I start talking about this crap, I will never fucking stop.</p><p></p><p>The last section of the site is called ‘Playboy’ and I am pretty fucking sure you all know what the hell you can see here. That is right, gorgeous celebrities who were in some way, connected to this beautiful magazine, which is now a porn site. Again, everything concerning Playboy and all the shit it offers will be listed in that section so make sure to check it out, since I am too fucking lazy to mention everything.</p><p></p><p>One very annoying thing on the site is that they did not really offer any sort of search options, just a search box. I understand that people would be searching by the name of their favorite celebrity, but I prefer to search by the naughty act instead. Hopefully, they will add that in the future, and make this place even more attractive.</p><p></p><p>Basically, if you like to see your favorite celebrity chicks in a naughty act, I suggest you visit this place. Celeb.gate.cc is a great site, with a good design, and a lot of gorgeous celebrities who have posted or been featured in a couple of naughty videos or images. So have fun browsing!</p>"}},{"id":"35d0893bb0d8","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"35d0893bb0d8","title":"TheFappening.pro","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"TheFappening.pro is a website that collects sexy magazine pictures and photography works of celebrities from iCloud streaming content and all sexy celebrity singers and models.","canonical":"https://theporndude.com/zh/2348/thefappeningpro","affiliate_url":"https://thefappening.pro/","rating":4,"siteOrder":6,"price":"premium","tags":[],"features":[],"categories":[{"id":"the-fappening","collection":"categories_en"}],"screenshot_url":"https://cdn.staticstack.net/assets/img/r-thumbs/1d91ce0-thefappeningpro_small.png","image_alt":"TheFappening.pro, nude photo website","scraped_at":"2025-10-28T17:10:48.272Z","iconSpritesheet":"default","logoIconClass":"icon80","pros":["a considerable array of nsfw centered around celebrities going wild or flashing","a handy alphabet of all featured stars, which is easy to navigate","a contact page detailing all lines of communication to the site staff"],"cons":["the overall design of the website is really boring","a lot of their ads tend to be blocked by mainstream antivirus"],"detailedDescription":"<p>Look, even though their behavior often makes us sing the 2010 Exodus song Burn. Hollywood, Burn, it’s hard to deny that many of the world’s celebrities equally make our cocks hard and leave us unable to fight our inner temptation and picture what they look like naked and doing some downright perverted sexual stuff.</p><p></p><p>But, my fellow porn fan, what the fuck are you imagining for? Did nobody tell you that celebrities are just like you and me and love to get down and dirty as everybody does? I’m not sure I believe you, MissAVDH; it’s hard to see your average celebrity on a porn site doing the same shit my favorite pornstars do. I hear you cry. Listen here, Negative Nancy, it’s a lot easier than you might expect. You’re probably just looking in the wrong places.</p><p></p><p>I’ve been around since the foundations of modern porn were first laid and have been ringside (literally) through some of its stickiest highlights. But did you think I’d overlook the filthiest sexual antics of the world’s most well-known celebrities that have been caught on camera? Not fuckin’ likely!</p><p></p><p>I’ve fapped to Kim Kardashian’s interracial sex tape masterpiece more times than I can count, and don’t even get me started when it comes to the amount of damage I’ve done to my cock while watching Pamela Anderson’s VHS-era porn masterpiece. As a result, I’ve become the go-to guy for discovering the best places to see celebrities going wild and the places you should avoid at all costs.</p><p></p><p>Today, my journey through celebrity tits and famous pussies takes me to a site called TheFappening.pro. Its name sounds ominous, and it’s said to be one of the wildest corners of the internet when it comes to seeing celebrities going wild. However, I was keen to know if it was all it was cracked up to be. Yep, it’s time for a classic MissAVDH review, TheFappening.pro, so pull your cum-stained socks up!</p><p></p><p>Now, will TheFappening.pro be a site that’ll impress me more than seeing pictures that confirm the weird-ass blonde chick from Die Antwoord is as sexually freaky as you’d imagine her to be? Or will it be an experience worse than waiting four hours to download what you think is Kim Kardashian’s big black cock beatdown only to find out it’s actually a 4K snap of Till Lindemann’s cock?</p><p></p><p>Let’s find out!</p><h3>What is TheFappening.pro?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Maybe you want to jerk off to Elle MacPherson sunbathing on a yacht with her gorgeous tits hanging out? This site will likely have you covered. But for the love of Christ, I’d highly advise you to jerk off to the second example rather than the first. I respect all kinks, but not cumming over Bill Gates’ unbridled lust!</p><p></p><p>According to Wayback Machine, TheFappening.pro can trace its roots back to 2017 and has gone on to build a pretty impressive array of celebrity porn and erotica in a relatively short time. Now, without further ado, let’s slide balls-deep into the kind of smut this site offers!</p><h3>What’s the Content Like on TheFappening.pro?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>So, where the fuck do you actually begin? You and your cock are undoubtedly overwhelmed at this point but try to calm him down because I”m here to help. I didn’t need to ask twice when it came to browsing through this site’s entire portfolio of celebrity-focused filth to find the highlights and, with a cock as red as a dress at The Oscars, it’s time to introduce you to the highlights I found!</p><p></p><p>● Mikaela Spielberg - Fellas, have you ever seen Steven Spielberg’s big titty daughter? This mixed-race 23-year-old has some of the finest tits you’ll ever see, and guess what? She’s started making her own porn, and TheFappening.pro covered it! I’m sorry, Steven, I love your work, but my cock comes first, and your daughter’s gigantic milkers are way too good to resist. I’d love to wrap my Jaws around her erect nipples before sliding into her dripping wet pussy and shouting ‘’Jurassic Park!’’ as I cum inside her before hastily leaving and saying, ‘’Catch Me if You Can!’’.</p><p>● Yolandi Visser from Die Antwoord - The instantly-recognisable face of the bizarre South African group Die Antwoord looks like she’d be able to give you extra-terrestrial levels of sex in the bedroom, and these pictures confirm it! This alien-looking chick looks being photographed naked and has a smoking hot body covered in tattoos. Better yet, she’s also a wild card on stage and can’t help flashing her pussy at the crowd. A great way to boost a slump in ticket sales!</p><p>● Abigail Shapiro - If you have ever seen a pair of milkers that make you scream out, ‘’Awooga!’’, then you’ll appreciate those of Ben Shapiro’s incredibly well-formed sister. TheFappening.pro has collected a badass series of snaps of Abigail with her gorgeous tits in all their glory. Her brother was notorious for saying, ‘’Facts don’t care about your feelings’’. Well, Ben, me neither, and the fact is your sister has some of the most wank-worthy milkers I’ve ever seen!</p><h3>The Design of the Site</h3><p></p><p></p><p>TheFappening.pro uses a basic Wordpress-style blog design and starts off with the site’s name in a generic font and a hashtag before it. This is then followed by a ten-link main menu that takes users to the homepage, the extensive list of celebrities to explore, their contact page, and more.</p><p></p><p>The site's homepage then displays a series of the site’s posts that seem to be randomized rather than a collection of the latest posts. This main feed is bordered on the right-hand side by a sidebar stuffed with widgets showcasing stuff like the latest comments added to the site, famous celebrities to explore, featured posts, and a handful of third-party ads.</p><p></p><p>In the site's footer, you can find all the boring stuff, like terms of use and disclaimers, alongside a horizontal menu of links leading users to some of the most instantly-recognizable celebrities currently being searched for on TheFappening.pro.</p><h3>What I Like Most About it</h3><p></p><p></p><p>It might not have explicit categories, but it does have a handy alphabetical list of well-known celebrities featured on the site, including some very obscure ones. So, chances are, you won’t have trouble finding the kind of smut you’re seeking on here.</p><p></p><p>Having a contact page is a crucial part of any site, yet it’s an area that so many web admins fail to cover. TheFappening.pro, on the other hand, has added a damn fine contact page that lets you reach out to the admins via various communication channels. However, it’s arguably one of the lamest positives an NSFW site can have.</p><h3>What I Don’t Like</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Navigation of the site is far from smooth, too, because there are no instantly relatable categories for people to choose from, such as sex tapes, topless sunbathing, etc. There is a search bar, but it’s not the easiest to find as it’s a small one tucked away in the sidebar. This would be better placed in the header of the site.</p><p></p><p>Also, I found that most of the site's ads were blatantly blocked by my antivirus. Not a good look, my dudes.</p><h3>Suggestions I Have for TheFappening.pro</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Reassess which third-party ads you’re putting on the site. When an antivirus blocks them automatically and imprints a warning message on your site, it doesn’t leave a good impression on your visitors.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p></p>"}},{"id":"99e90905dfee","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"99e90905dfee","title":"Scandal Planet","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"ScandalPlanet.comScandal Planet is a website focused on sharing various pornographic content related to celebrities.

Most people with a functioning libido have at some point in their life developed a celebrity crush for a certain actor/actress, diva, pop-star, fashion model and so on. Most of the world would love to see some A-list celebrities naked or getting fucked, and the paparazzi have been trying to get evidence of that for literally decades now. But with the introduction of the internet and better technology in general, it’s become easier and easier to peek into the private lives of celebs.</p><p></p><p>Everyone’s seen and probably fapped to High School Musical’s Vanessa Hudgens' nudes, alongside Rihanna and Scarlet Johannson’s. There’s a LOT of celebrity XXX content on the internet at this point, and the fine people running ‘Scandal Planet’ have decided to amass a wide collection of it and categorize, allowing millions of horny wankers from all over the world to jerk off to it (or so it may seem that way).</p><p></p><h3>More than Just Nudes</h3><p></p><p></p><p>One of the most recent examples of popular celebs filming sex scenes is Lady Gaga’s ‘A Star is Born’, which is a movie about her life that has her in a few nude and sex scenes. If you decide to explore beyond the home page, you’ll quickly find many more sex scenes on the site’s ‘Celeb Porn’, category, which contains movie clips featuring celebrities from all over the world getting fucked by their co-stars. There’s also the very specific ‘Roleplayed Forced Sex’ category which has authentic sex scenes, although this time the starlets are featured in sex scenes from various movies from all over the world, which brings me to my next point…</p><p></p><h3>The Material Here is from All Over the World</h3><p></p><p></p><h3>Categories Are Extremely Vague and Not Very Helpful</h3><p></p><p></p><p>The next ‘Celebrity Sex Tapes’ category is strictly celebrity sex tapes, and all of them were also featured on the previously mentioned ‘Celeb Porn’ category, which again shows me that the categorization on this website is a total fucking disaster.</p><p></p><h3>Lots of the Stuff Here is Fake</h3><p></p><p></p><p>This exact same situation is also apparent with many other celebrities like Selena Gomez, Emma Stone, Lauren Cohen and so on. It’s one thing to have shitty categories, but putting up fake sex tapes of famous celebrities is just plain fucking evil, because you get the hopes up of thousands of people and later on betray them when they find out that the video they’re fapping to isn’t authentic. But there’s one more major flaw about this website that makes it completely not worth your time…</p><p></p><h3>Most Videos Are Just Snippets…</h3><p></p><p></p><p>I decided to actually press on the gateway prompt out of curiosity, praying I don’t get a virus, and I end up on a site called ‘Celebpornarchive’, which leads me to completely lose trace of the original video I wanted to watch. I realized that this is just another one of those endless rabbit hole situations where shitty XXX sites lead you to other shitty XXX sites through the promise of delivering good porn via attractive thumbnails. After this, It’s safe to say that this website really isn’t worth your time at all no matter how horny you are.</p><p></p><h3>Don’t Bother With It</h3><p></p>"}},{"id":"33df6dafcda7","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"33df6dafcda7","title":"CelebsRoulette","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"CelebsRoulette.comCelebs Roulette is a website that shares videos of celebrities nude and fucked to see if your favorite female celebrity has ever taken off her clothes in front of the camera, no matter if she has taken off in a scene in a movie...","canonical":"https://theporndude.com/zh/1576/celebsroulette","affiliate_url":"https://celebsroulette.com/","rating":4,"siteOrder":8,"price":"free","tags":[],"features":[],"categories":[{"id":"the-fappening","collection":"categories_en"}],"screenshot_url":"https://cdn.staticstack.net/assets/img/r-thumbs/df87103-celebsroulette_small.png","image_alt":"CelebsRoulette, nude photo website","scraped_at":"2025-10-28T17:11:04.189Z","iconSpritesheet":"custom-favicon-spritesheet.png","iconPosition":"-336px -144px","iconClassName":"ctm-icon1576","logoIconClass":"icon1576","pros":["all free","huge collection of celeb nude/sex scenes","high-quality vids","hot celebs","lots of pornstars/pornos mixed in"],"cons":["no roulette/random feature","missing thumbnails on model page","lots of pornstars/pornos mixed in"],"detailedDescription":"<p>Celebs Roulette! Pornstars know their fans are ruining their eyesight and growing hair on their palms every time they watch their movies. What about regular, “clean” celebrities? Surely, Eliza Dushka knows people are beating off to her even if she’s never flashed her beaver at the camera. It’s something to think about while you’re beating off to Eliza Dushka and other celebrities over at Celebs Roulette.</p><p></p><p>The site’s been around for about four years and currently gets almost 3 million views a month. That’s a lot of horny motherfuckers trying to see famous titties. It’s funny, the entire rest of the Internet is dedicated to pornstars showing off the goods, but it just ain’t good enough for you? Ah, the heart wants what it wants, am I right? Let’s get to it.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Nude Celeb Videos On Tap</h3><p></p><p></p><p>There’s no Random or Roulette button in the header, so I guess this Being Watched section is the closest we’re going to get to a built-in fap roulette. Come on, CelebsRoulette, it’s in your name. You know people are going to look for the feature.</p><p></p><p>I do see a pretty delicious cross-section of material currently being browsed. Somebody’s waxing the carrot to Kim Basinger in 9 1/2 Weeks. Another pervert is flogging the bishop to Penelope Cruz in Ma Ma. I’d like to extend thanks to whoever was spanking the monkey to Rosamund Pike in Women in Love. I had no idea that gorgeous, dead-eyed broad ever took it off in a film.</p><p></p><p>The New scenes turned me on to further shit that turns me on. Did you know Patricia Arquette did nudity? It’s peak Patricia Arquette, too--1988. I’m going to have to come back to that. There’s another Rosamund Pike scene in there, too, so I’m a happy motherfucker.</p><p></p><p>While CelebsRoulette keeps track of which celebrities have gotten naked in movies, it focuses on famous broads, not dudes. If you’re looking for every nude scene Aubrey Plaza has done, CelebsRoulette has got you covered. What you won’t find, for example, is an extensive cataloging of every time Harvey Keitel has shown his dick in a movie.</p><p></p><p>Speaking of, the guy has a real commitment to male full-frontal nudity on the silver screen. Not a lot of people realize this, but Harvey Keitel has been in almost 300 movies, and he’s shown his penis in each and every single one of them. Google it if you don’t believe me, numb-nuts, ‘cause it ain’t on CelebsRoulette!</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Rosamund Pike Is A Future Sex Doll</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Naturally, I had to check out one of her scenes pretty much as soon as I saw her on CelebsRoulette. Women in Love came out in 2011, but I’d never heard of it until now. It doesn’t sound like my kind of thing. If it was called Women in an Anal-Fisting Threesome, well, that’d be another fucking story altogether.</p><p></p><p>The video loads up in a clean, simple player. If I was supposed to see an ad first, my pop-up blocker caught it.</p><p></p><p>The scene opens with Pike in a bathtub with some dude. It’s a sexy enough image, but I have to turn off the sound because blah blah blah feelings blah blah lady stuff. Thankfully, she’s out of the tub and fully nude in the next scene a few seconds later, making out with some buff dude. Dude has erectile dysfunction from what I can tell, but I was hard enough to dent a car.</p><p></p><p>It’s actually a montage of clips from this film (or series, I’m not quite sure). In another scene, she’s skinny dipping with a different broad. She’s got full make-up on in the water, which is exactly what you’d expect from a Humanoid Sex Android. It won’t wash off with either pond water or a hot eruption of jizz.</p><p></p><p>At the end of the montage, we get some of the better stuff again, this time in slow motion. I might have been distracted by Rosamund’s perfect, perky little tits, engineered by sex-doll technicians, but I still haven’t seen the supposedly human actress blink.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Also Featuring… Who?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>The appeal of a celebrity site is you’re going to see celebrities naked. You see them on TV or in a movie first, you have some dirty thoughts, and then you check a site like CelebsRoulette to see if they have any nude scenes.</p><p></p><p>I’ve reloaded the front page and I’ve got a few new ones I recognize. Rachel McAdams, Elizabeth Olsen, and Jennifer Lawrence all have some material on CelebsRoulette that I’m going to have to check out.</p><p></p><p>The rest of the videos look hot. In fact, some of them look like straight-up porno. I just don’t recognize any of the other “celebrities”.</p><p></p><p>There is a scene from Nymphomaniac on the list. The flick is basically a porno masquerading as an art film. It’s got Shia LaBeouf, though he claims it was really a pornstar’s dick that got computered in during post-production. I’d probably say the same thing, because “his character” couldn’t get it up.</p><p></p><p>Just clicking randomly on videos, it looks like a lot of the movies have a similar wine-and-cheese vibe. I’m so glad the art fuckers are openly perverts these days. Also, thanks to sites like CelebsRoulette, I don’t have to sit through stuffy art films just to see the parts with penetration.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Seriously, Who?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>The Top Sites on CelebsRoulette are places like PlayBoyTV, LustCinema, and BoundHeat. That helps explain why so many videos just look like porno. It turns out, they’re actually porno. I like porno, yeah, but it seems like throwing that in is adding noise. People are here for the celebs, right? Maybe I’m wrong.</p><p></p><p>The Top Models are just baffling. On a site called CelebsRoulette, I’ve heard of literally none of their “Top Models”. Lana Sue? Pau Pappei? Lina Bembe? WTF?</p><p></p><p>I clicked Samantha Bentley, because I thought she at least sounded familiar. CelebsRoulette has two scenes with her.</p><p></p><p>Oh, right. Now I know why Samantha Bentley sounded familiar. That said, she’s really not what people are looking for when they’re trying to knock their junk around to a celeb site. Samantha Bently is what people are looking for when they’re trying to knock their junk around to a porn site.</p><p></p><p>A trip to the Models section reveals more pornstars, each with scenes to view on CelebsRoulette. It’s a weird gallery of names you don’t recognize. Most don’t even have an image, just a black box for a thumbnail.</p><p></p><p>CelebsRoulette.com (often misspelled as \"celebsroullette\") has some great celeb material, but you have to know which famous broads you’re looking for. The site has a decent selection of pornstars with a ton of good content, but it may get in the way if you want a true celebrity wank session.</p>"}},{"id":"626ef3b506f6","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"626ef3b506f6","title":"Ancensored","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"Ancensored.com Are you tired of using Netflix?

After I rub it raw reviewing porn sites all day, I try to cool off with some regular primetime TV or blockbuster movies. I always end up spanking it to the famous broads on the screen, whether they flash their shaved twats or not. They usually don’t, ever, but when I see a chick like Brie Larson on the screen I hold out hope. The fuckers at Ancensored.com ain’t sitting on their thumbs waiting for it.</p><p></p><p>The About Us section of Ancensored.com lays it out pretty clearly. This crack team of perverts has spent the last decade building a platform for storing, sharing, and watching the biggest collection of celebrity nudes in the world. Every porn site claims they’re the best, but these numbers back it up. The stash includes over 150k videos and nearly a million pics of naked actresses, singers, athletes, and even politicians.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Naked Celebrities and A Wild Ejaculation of Spam</h3><p></p><p></p><p>After I typed that paragraph, I clicked the background on Ancensored to get back to my browser. The site repaid the favor by giving me a dose of full-screen pop-up spam, puncturing the condom of my ad-blocker. Not a great way to make an impression.</p><p></p><p>Today’s Featured and Popular Celebrities scroll by in a box toward the top. Maisie Williams took her top off on Game of Thrones the other day, so she’s at the top of the list. I didn’t know who Daniella Pineda and Sara Cardinaletti were before now, but I’ll definitely be checking them out. Scarlett Johansson and Kelly Preston are Featured and Popular today on Ancensored, just as they are on every celebrity site ever.</p><p></p><p>Instead of a page of Sansa Stark nudes, I got a pop-up that was supposed to look like a Windows error screen. It took up the whole page while three robot lady voices told me my computer had been compromised and I needed to call a phone number to get it fixed.</p><p></p><p>You’ve seen this kind of spam before, but it’s been a while since one this bad made it through my blocker. The window was very difficult to close, popping up a new one each time until my browser intervened. Some old dudes are going to have a heart attack over this shit when they were just trying to spank it to Elizabeth Olsen content.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Your Favorite Girls from Movies and TV, Naked</h3><p></p><p></p><p>One thing I really hate about the site? The first time I clicked the TV Show link in the header, I didn’t go to the TV-Show page. Instead, I got another full-screen ad. Good goddamn. I’m just trying to see some premium cable titties!</p><p></p><p>It turns out the chick I was looking for is named Emmy Rossum. I’m in luck, because Ancensored has 26 pics and 5 clips of her. Emmy’s nudes are all from Shameless.</p><p></p><p>I actually only caught a couple of episodes a few years ago, so I was surprised by the wealth of material it’s given to Ancensored. There are two pages of actresses from the show, each with their own collections on the site. Naturally, every TV show and movie has its own gallery of scenes as well.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>An Encyclopedia of Celebrity Nudes</h3><p></p><p></p><p>(If you actually want to play Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon, you’ll have to start at IMDB or something first. He’s not on Ancensored’s master list, but so many of his gorgeous costars are.)</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Sneak Peeks</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Nestled beneath the sex scenes from Badbarbies (2014) and The Work Wife (2018), the Top 100 also features many other celebrity entries. I’m interested in the newer one, but that looks like Olivia Munn in the 2014 thumbnail, so I need a closer look.</p><p></p><p>Ancensored is really a mixed bag. There’s one thing I absolutely love about this celebrity nude site, and another I fucking hate. Whether or not the site is worth your time depends on how you feel about those things.</p><p></p><p>What’s a good trade for access to a giant collection of famous naked chicks, both video, and photos? Let’s say it’s also indexed really well, so you can find things easily and browse in a really fun way. A little bit of spam, right? Every free sex site supports itself with a few ads.</p><p></p><p>Ancensored doesn’t show you just a few ads, though. The site looks pretty clean and banner-free with an ad-blocker, but I had a serious issue with pop-up spam. Some of it was pretty malicious stuff, aimed at basically robbing you. I’m not saying Ancensored will steal your wife’s purse, but they ain’t keeping the bad guys out. Be careful.</p><p></p><p>If you can handle some serious and dangerous spam, Ancensored (often misspelled as \"ancnesored\", \"ancesored\", \"ancencored\" and \"acensored\") actually has a great collection of celebrity nudes and sex scenes.

Then celebrate and thank me for linking you to Nudography.com.</p><p></p><p>(Technically, I suppose you should also thank the site’s webmaster, but if you’re reading this, how else would you know about it if it weren’t for me.)</p><p></p><p>Anyway, this compilation is one of the best resources for those who like keeping tabs with the photos, public nipple slips, and nudie scenes of your favorite celebs.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>What’s the Point?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>“I created this site when I was continually running into the same problem. I would see a movie, and some pretty girl would capture my attention. And the first thing I would think of is, “Where can I see her naked?” (Sick, I know, but I’m pretty sure most guys go through the same process.)…”</p><p></p><p>Yeah, we do, bro. Anyway, back to the quote!</p><p></p><p>“And later, when you come home, you rush to your computer and Google her name. Usually, you get 10000+ porn sites telling you to pay $30 to see her naked. Unfortunately, a lot of the times, this is just a way to lure you in where they have all her pictures, but it usually turns out that she hasn't done any nudity.</p><p></p><p>So I thought of creating this site. We try to research all nudity material, essentially telling you if there actually are any nude photos or not.</p><p></p><p>Lately, we also try to post all nudity related news, list of future nudity…”</p><p></p><p>To give you my TL;DR summary of Nudography, it's essentially a cumpilation…I mean compilation of regularly updated information on the hottest female celebrities. Using this site, you'll see daily news and photos about these ladies in sexy outfits they wear at award events, accidental (and also \"accidental\") wardrobe malfunctions, as well as risque photos from recent movies which range from a flash of sideboob to full-on frontal nudity.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Blogs About Famous Boobs</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Talk about variety!</p><p></p><p>Anyway, every post thoroughly links you to detailed celeb profiles (more on that later), tightly written information, and new nudie pics.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Lovely Celebs Lists</h3><p></p><p></p><p>On their Top 100 page, you'll get a list of the top-ranked celebrities, their onsite rating, how many votes they got from the site's users, and a ranking of how much skin they've shown on camera.</p><p></p><p>Of course, you’ll love it that all the babes on this page have exposed a lot of their erotic areas. Furthermore, unlike other tanked lists, this list changes weekly due to constant Nudography member voting.</p><p></p><p>Are you interested in seeing all of the girls on the site in one organized section? Then check this website’s A-Z list, which has all of the hundreds of famous foxy babes just like <a href=\"https://MissAVDH.com/1882/aznude\" target=\"_blank\">AZNude</a>. You can even filter your results by country of origin.</p><p></p><p>On top of that, the Highlight’s page features larger pictures showing off a bevy of famous babes. Seriously, check out their December 2018 pics, they’ll really warm up your cock.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Celeb Profiles</h3><p></p><p></p><p>In addition to giving you some of their biographical information, site rank, and user rating, you might also get a link to a celebs IMDb or <a href=\"https://MissAVDH.com/578/mrskin\" target=\"_blank\">Mr Skin</a> page. By checking these resources out, you'll get even more information about these ladies' first and latest nudity scenes.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Porn Pics</h3><p></p><p></p><p>How strange, right?</p><p></p><p>It's probably because, unlike other websites, all of the pics are from third-party websites and aren’t unique to Nudography. Worse, though, to maintain the same level of quality, all pics are roughly the same size, usually a measly 150 by 150 pixels. Talk about some tiny tits, or at least pictures of them.</p><p></p><p>So, you’ll get a nice peek at some porn pics, but what you'll see is frustratingly small and low-res.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Sex Tapes</h3><p></p><p></p><p>But there is no plugin to see the footage or even a preview trailer. Worse, most of the sex tape pages tease you with a \"Watch IT!\" button – only to lead you to other offsite platforms like Vivid and Banned Sex Tapes. If you don't know, these are pay-to-view websites, and neither are particularly cheap.</p><p></p><p>Talk about a fucking bullshit tease.</p><p></p><p>So, this platform doesn’t actually host any fuck footage at all.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Registration Benefits?</h3><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Web Design</h3><p></p><p></p><p>The onsite search function works great and even adjusts for misspellings. Great news for you less than perfectly literate fuckers and those of you who’re typing one-handed.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Community Interaction</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Moving on, by holding a membership, you can comment on articles, rank your preferred celebs, and vote on who you think is hottest. However, just because you have a subscription doesn’t mean that you get better picture quality or any video footage.</p><p></p><p>On the other hand, it’s easier to get a hold of the webmasters to link them to a story they missed, and you can even add pics that are relevant to the site.</p><p></p><p>Overall, there are some excellent community features, but not as many as you’d get on a proper porno site.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Summing Up This Sex Site</h3><p></p><p></p><p>For sure, this website is well put together, but it's not really my thing. The nudes are great, but the quality isn't the best, and there aren't any videos.</p>"}},{"id":"4ea5448f13a4","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"4ea5448f13a4","title":"Motherless Celebrities","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"This is a celebrity-themed sex video on Motherless.com.

It’s a fact of life as fundamental as gravity. It’s a force of nature that cannot be stopped by beast, man, or God. It’s an eternal truth and a divine mandate. As sure as the sun will rise, men will attempt to view as many women naked as they possibly can. Any man not doing so is either a sad or a gay one.</p><p></p><p>This means that any woman a man sees regularly is mentally stripped down during every interaction. If any women are reading this article for some god-forsaken reason, I want you to know that every man at work pictures you naked every day, even if you are ugly. We can’t help it - our minds are endlessly curious about the nude female form. Then again, our species depends on it.</p><p>Anywhere men and women are together in the same room, dirty thoughts follow. It doesn’t matter if it’s a church or a strip club. The male brain can even adjust sexiness to help us fuck ugly bitches if that’s all that’s available.</p><p></p><p>There’s a term known as boat goggles among Navy brats and fishermen. When a bunch of men and women are trapped together on a small boat, tons of fucking happens. At the end of a three-month journey, there isn’t a single surface on that boat that hasn’t been blasted with cum. You could put the hottest models on a boat with the ugliest old dudes, and someone is still getting fucked. What happens on the ship stays on the ship.</p><p></p><p>Maybe that helps to explain the recent popularity of fake taboo. I suppose it’s not recent, considering people have been fucking relatives for one reason or another for thousands of years. It was foolish of me to think that modern man had grown out of such activities.</p><p></p><p>As I think of it, though, isn’t the family unit kind of like a boat. You see these motherfuckers day in and day out. Perhaps that makes people with weak minds want to dick down their stepsister. It certainly didn’t do that to me. I want to make it clear that the reason I don’t watch taboo porn is that I’m better than you. You guys should join me. I may have an idea of how you got here, but I still don’t approve. That should cut deep.</p><p></p><p>The world is more connected than it has ever been. As a result, the boat called planet Earth is getting smaller and smaller. No one feels far away anymore, between jets, the internet, and smartphones. But who are the real denizens of this boat?</p><p>We all may be floating on this bitch, but no one knows your name outside of the parents you want so desperately to fuck. The same can’t be said about celebs, though. Celebs are entities we all want to fuck.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>A Brand New Age of Naked Celebs</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Perhaps back in the day when the cellphone camera was first invented, you could hide your nudes like treasure, but everything is on the cloud these days. You could try to hide your nude pics, but someone will find and release them. This goes doubly so for famous bitches.</p><p></p><p>One of the best moments of my life was The Fappening. I still remember waking up that morning and hearing the news. Being connected to the porn world as I am, I had heard rumors that there would be a massive release of celebrity nudes, but I didn’t fully believe it. Fortunately, luck would have it that I was very wrong.</p><p></p><p>For the uninitiated, The Fappening was a massive dump of celeb nudes hackers stole and had the hearts kind enough to distribute. Looking back, I don’t know how I made it so long, not knowing what Kate Upton looked like nude. My life is so much better now.</p><p></p><p>The Fappening was a massive file dump. There’s enough porn here to keep a man busy for many moons. The only question is, where is the best place to view it. The content has made its way to many places, but they are not alike. One of my favorite places to get my Fappening content is Motherless.</p><p></p><p><strong>Motherless has tons of great content of every variant, but they did a particularly great job hunting down all the Fappening content they could</strong>.</p><p></p><p>Motherless has been around for a while now and has developed a superb site in that time. The main menu sits up top and has the options Home, Search bar, log in, Sign up, Random image, Videos, Images, Categories, Shouts, Cams, Groups, Galleries, Community, Girls, Chat, Store, and Upload. As you can see, Motherless is a fucking massive porn site. They even have their own store and blog community. These guys are passionate about their porn.</p><p></p><p>Once you have searched for The Fappening, a filter menu will pop up above the thumbnails with the options All, Videos, Images, Galleries, Boards, Groups, and Filter by. The filter is a drop-down menu that allows you to search by upload date or video duration.</p><p></p><p>I wasn’t lying when I said Motherless did an excellent job hunting down as much Fappening content as possible. As a result, they have over a thousand videos and almost ten thousand images. That’s one of the largest collections I’ve ever seen.</p><p></p><p>Because of how much content there is, my favorite videos tend to be compilations, and of those, I find myself returning to the jerk-off challenges over and over again. I’m a competitive guy, so if you put a jerk-off challenge in front of me, I’m going to take it.</p><p></p><p>Most jerk-off challenge compilations are themed around one celeb. I’ll take you through some of my favorites, starting with Miley Cyrus. Miley has no qualms about showing off her naked body. Her tight little body drives me wild. She might not be able to twerk, but she can sit on my cock anytime she likes.</p><p></p><p>Similarly, the Natalie Dormer challenge made me launch a nut well before the video ended. I love that resting bitch face she has. It says, “your tiny cock will never please me, but I guess I’ll let you fuck me anyway.” That’s what we call doing the lord’s work, Natalie.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Hosing Down the Cervix</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Eva Longoria is another universally loved hotty. There’s not much I wouldn’t do to have her whispering dirty talk into my ear while she rides me cowgirl style. If I’m fucking Eva Longoria, I want it to be in a room full of mirrors, so I scan every inch of her nude body. I would remember every second of that encounter until the day I drop dead. Heaven won’t have anything on busting a nut in Eva’s mouth.</p><p></p><p>The Fappening is one of the best things to ever happen to humanity. I’m not sure where I would be right now without it. Probably out on the streets begging for coins and jerking off to a doll I made out of bottle tops and six-pack rings. Fortunately, I live in a timeline where nude celebs abound.</p><p></p><p>There are many places to look at Fappening content, but few are as efficient and well designed as Motherless. They did everything they could to hunt down every last drop of content and post it in all its glory. There’s no pixel loss from shitty uploads or photoshopped nudes. This is the real shit right here, ladies and gents.</p><p></p><p>There’s so much to love about Motherless, but that doesn’t mean that it’s perfect. I love the random image generator in the top right hand of the page. I would love to see that spread so that I can specifically get random images from the Fappening dump. Sometimes you don’t know who you want to see and need an algorithm to assist your selection.</p><p></p><p>Motherless has one of the best Fappening collections on the internet. If you like nude celebs, you will love Motherless.</p>"}},{"id":"394e4b88faa8","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"394e4b88faa8","title":"CelebMasta","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"In addition to the weird page about us, Celebmasta.com is also a good website with rich celebrity nude content and a series of sexy Hollywood actresses' sex scenes","canonical":"https://theporndude.com/zh/13201/celebmasta","affiliate_url":"https://celebmasta.com/","rating":4,"siteOrder":12,"price":"free","tags":[],"features":[],"categories":[{"id":"the-fappening","collection":"categories_en"}],"screenshot_url":"https://cdn.staticstack.net/assets/img/r-thumbs/fd6c8c4-celebmasta_small.png","image_alt":"CelebMasta, nude photo website","scraped_at":"2025-10-28T17:11:28.502Z","iconSpritesheet":"custom-favicon-spritesheet.png","iconPosition":"-416px -656px","iconClassName":"ctm-icon13201","logoIconClass":"icon13201","pros":["a bastion of erotic celebrity content with tonnes of celebs and actresses represented","the site is well-optimized, and it’s effortless to find your desired celebrity","almost all photo and video posts are accompanied by a well-written writeup"],"cons":["the about page of the site is a weird experience and needs a rewrite"],"detailedDescription":"<p>Celeb Masta!

This site is rocking a pretty badass logo of a sunglasses-wearing martial arts master dominating the site’s name. The logo has clearly been professionally designed and offers a great introduction to Celebmasta.com.</p><p></p><p>After the logo is a main menu that takes you to some of the site’s most critical areas, such as the homepage, an alphabetical list of celebrity names featured, nude celebrity content, and celeb sex scenes from TV shows and Hollywood movies. All of this is underlined by a long search bar that allows you to search for any specific celebrities you have in mind.</p><p></p><p>After this is the homepage of Celebmasta.com, which is divided into two sections. The first section on the left-hand side is a vertical list of featured celebrity names that each come with a large featured image showcasing each one. When you click on one, you’re taken to the site’s content portfolio surrounding each featured name.</p><p></p><p>Then, there’s a sidebar on the right-hand side of the homepage, which provides a smaller vertical list of some of the most popular celebrities featured on the site, such as Elizabeth Olsen, Billie Eilish, Doja Cat, and Margot Robbie.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>What I Like Most About it</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Also, there’s a fuck tonne of celebrities out there, and the list is growing by the day.

I mean, when you see the ‘wiki’ in the name, you can already expect the city to be a bit more informative than action-driven, and that somewhat applies here. While they do have loads and loads of content, there are no actual videos, just images.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Just a basic-looking site for naughty pictures.</h3><p></p><p></p><p>There is no structure, you will just have o randomly browse to see what they have to offer, and the crap that you find is not as satisfying. However, this is just my opinion, because I am really not a fan of porn images in general… you could say that I just do onto see the point of that shit, this does not fall under my ‘must-see’ category.</p><p></p><p>Unless there is some actual action on the screen, my willy will not get hard. I can see how people can get interested in the content thefappening.wiki has to offer, since here you will mostly have images of celebrities… you know, the shit everyone gets bat-shit crazy over. Well, this is a site dedicated to that, if that is what makes you happy.</p><p></p><p>On top, you can choose to browse the home, where everything is hella messy… or you can browse celebrities instead. There are a shit-ton of celebrities, so I think it is safe to say that you will find whoever you are looking for. The browsing and all that shit are rather simple, so I do not think I need to speak about that bullshit.</p><p></p><p>Though, I do want to say that their flashy ads were fucking annoying. I understand the fact that free sites will use ads and all that crap to earn a living, but at the same time, I was hoping that they would not have all those gif kinds. They can be rather distracting when you are in the right mood for some fapping… and well, I fucking was.</p><p></p><p>If you like picture sites I am sure you will appreciate everything thefappening.wiki has to offer, because, at the end of the day, that is what the site is all about. You will probably think I am full of shit when you see the “Sex Tapes” offered on top, but do not get your dick or hopes up because that is basically a link that will take you to a premium site where you can subscribe if you want to see that type of content.</p><p></p><p>The last tab is labeled as “Webcam Girls” and that is exactly what the fuck you will get. You will be taken to onlinegirls.com, which basically looks like any other porn site out there, and then you can choose which bitch from the crowd you would like to watch. The webcam site is not bad, but then again there are many better ones out there.</p><p></p><p>Now, this goes without saying, but if this place is not enough to satisfy your dirty desires, you should explore my site first. I have taken my sweet time and explore the online world for the best porno websites out there, and I have also listed them neatly under the categories. However, if you love to browse and look at nudes from celebrities, there is no doubt that you will love thefappening.wiki.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>So, what kind of content can I expect?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>The first time I opened the site, I was welcomed by countless of nudes and some articles on the side. The first article featured Emma Watson. However, is that proof really enough to get my donger hard, I did not think so… I need solid proof before I will believe that Emma Watson will do such shit.</p><p></p><p>While we are on the topic, there were a couple of categories featuring the same Harry Potter chick, but it was so fucking obvious that all those images were photoshopped. I want to know who takes time out of their life to do this… but whatever. You have a little bit of everything here, from actual nudes to photoshopped shit. If you squint your eyes, they all look real.</p><p></p><p>There are a total of 1965 celebs (at the time I visited the site), with over 42500 photos. It looks like they do update the site quite frequently or well they follow the crap that is happening, which I a good thing. In the beginning, I saw all the known celebrities, such as Jenifer Lawrence, Kate Upton, Rihanna, Kim K, Miley Cyrus and so on.</p><p></p><p>So, as far as the celebrity variety goes, I think that you will find the beauty who suits your taste, or you already have one chick in mind. I tried searching for a couple of celebrities I wanted to see here, and I was able to find everything. However, they do have a couple of issues that I would like for them to work on.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Search options are shitty.</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Now, that is all fun and games, but you do not really have a search box, you do not have the categories or the tags… basically, what you need to do is choose the first letter of that chick’s name and then either manually browse until you find the celebrity you are looking for or Ctrl+F and then search that way… there is no other way to do it.</p><p></p><p>I refuse to believe that they were not able to create a proper search system, with just the basic categories or at least the actual search box… oh well. At least, this is one of the biggest celebrity databases I have seen so far, and when it comes to the nude content, they have not disappointed me… obviously.</p><p></p><p>Now, one thing I do wish that they would change or add is the fact that they have no celebrity tapes. I understand that thefappening.wiki is a site dedicated to just the images and that crap, but I cannot help but wish for them to add the videos. However, those who are here for that nudes, will surely be satisfied, believe me.</p><p></p><p>I mean, when it comes to the number of naughty celebrities they have to offer, I am pretty sure you will find a beauty you are searching for. They have everyone, from the known babes who are active in the industry currently, to the old-school actresses who were famous once, and now nobody talks about them anymore.</p><p></p><p>Keep in mind that some of these images are photoshopped, and I think that it is quite obvious which ones are legit and which ones are not, with just one glance at the shit they have to offer. Overall, there is a lot thefappening.wiki has to offer, and if you have a favorite celebrity you would like to see in some dirty action, you are more than welcome to explore what this place has to offer.</p><p></p><p>The best part about thefappening.wiki is the fact that they have the biggest database of hot celebrities out there, and to make things even better, everything they have to offer is free. You can browse as much as you want, read what they have to say about each celebrity photos, and do whatever comes naturally; whether that’ll be fapping or saving these images to your PC.</p>"}},{"id":"0691b280c5f3","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"0691b280c5f3","title":"Fappenist","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"Fappenist.com If you are looking for a website that won't ask you for money or use ads to bother your website when you browse its endless ocean of pornography, then you don't have to keep looking for it anymore.

What should we move on to? Stuff made by these huge studios just won't cut it for most of us...so what should we turn to? Well, most people would say that we need to check out some top tier amateur porn, which isn't a bad suggestion indeed. Matter of fact, it's the best possible suggestion you could get. You'd know that your pleasure should always come first, and so, you should know that you should only get the best possible amateur porn for yourself, right?</p><p></p><p>Seeing as this kind of stuff usually isn't too easy to find seeing as amateur pornography doesn't get that much traffic going and all that jazz, you need a proper good website to help you get the good stuff. You'll find that a whole lot of these pages that are supposedly all about amateur pornography are absolute scams and that they will not help you get what you want. So, where should you go? What should you do? You should turn to a porn expert such as me, MissAVDH, and you should ask for some advice. Luckily, I know just the right place that you should head out to if you're looking for some good amateur pornography.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Well, it's about celebrities. Nasty, dirty celebrities that is</h3><p></p><p></p><p>For example, if you're looking for Kim Kardashian's famous sex tape, that's exactly what you'll find on Fappenist.com, furthermore, if you're looking for videos of Cardi B working as a stripper before the fame and showing off that gorgeous body of hers, you'll find that in here as well. All in all, this page really has a whole lot of interesting stuff. However, this page isn't all about nudity as well. You'll find out that there are tons of nip slips on Fappenist.com, too. That's pretty great if you're into that kind of stuff. Furthermore, you'll also find that this page does post tons and tons of sexy gifs as well, which is a huge plus.</p><p></p><p>Why bother watching these lame ass videos where you can only find a few boring scenes, and that's all when you can just look up a gif and wank away to that one good part of a certain video while it repeats itself indefinitely? Well, that's what the \"gif\" section on this website is for, so make sure you head out and give it a look, you surely won't regret it. Now that we've mentioned one of the many sections of this website, shouldn't we talk about the others? There are tons that we should talk about in here, so let's make sure we give them the attention they deserve!</p><p></p><p></p><h3>The sections of Fappenist.com</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Then, you'll notice three rather juicy tabs right next to the \"categories\" tab, and you'll want to give them a whole lot of attention. First off, let's start with the \"videos\" header tab, a tab where you'll find nothing but...well, videos, and that's about it.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Pictures can say a thousand words</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Last, but not least, we find the \"Gifs\" section right next to the \"photos\" section, and this one is pretty damn good as well. If I had to single out one of these sections, though, that would be a very difficult task, seeing as all of these are pretty good. The only section that I won't be looking up at any point in my life is the \"news\" section of Fappenist.com since I really don't see anything too interesting in here, but some of you might want to see what the page has in store for you. I'll be honest, though: I really don't care that much.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>What about the categories</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Because the meanies of Fappenist.com aren't willing to tell you what's up, MissAVDH will tell you what's up: They ain't got no categories. That's what up. All in all, the header tabs you find in the upper right corner are essentially the only \"categories\" you will find on this website. There's the \"videos\" category, there's the \"gifs\" category, and there's the \"photos\" category, and that's about it. There's nothing else to see.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Thoughts about the visuals</h3><p></p>"}},{"id":"a0f9aa4ce7fc","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"a0f9aa4ce7fc","title":"HeroEro","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"HeroEro.com has free celebrity nudes and movie sex scenes activities!

Arguably, your dirty old friend MissAVDH is usually that pantless champion you need, pointing you toward your ideal fap material, whether it’s lesbian threesomes, hentai or some wild fetish porn for the real freaks. Today, though, I’m going to talk about another hero making his lifesaving rounds on the Internet smut scene. Thanks to this magnanimous fucker, I think I avoided another indecent exposure arrest at the local cineplex.</p><p></p><p>The titular HeroEro is represented in golden silhouette beside HeroEro.com’s logo. He’s buff, he’s tough, and <strong>he’s here to help you jerk off to gorgeous nude celebrities and movie sex scenes</strong>. Yes, ladies and gentlemen and aggressively masturbating perverts, this right here is a free celebrity sex tube. They ain’t the only library of famous naked folks on the web, but they are a lot more popular than some of the other contenders; every day, more than 4,000 celebrity fans are touching themselves while perusing the collection.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Sexy Movie Stars in Sexy Movie Scenes</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, even the “average” chicks on the shittiest daytime soaps are fucking gorgeous. The leading ladies in the big movies are often supermodel quality, and the best mainstream flicks often have at least a little sex. It’s not the hardcore crotch-shot footage you get on sites like Brazzers, but the women are goddesses and the production values are fucking insane.</p><p></p><p>What’s a horny dude to do? I stopped getting invited to movie nights with friends and I can’t even go to any of the local movie theaters without putting on a disguise. Fortunately, <strong>HeroEro features some of the hottest famous chicks in some of their sexiest, most naked scenes</strong>. You can watch the dirty parts over and over without sitting through the boring parts, and at the low cost of nothing, it’s even cheaper than fapping to Netflix.</p><p></p><p>The front page of HeroEro.com has the typical tube setup you expect. It’s a wall of thumbnails featuring popular celebrity sex scenes and the latest famous sluts added to the site. It ain’t just Hollywood flicks, either, but an international collection of nude scenes from around the world. Many people think of foreign films as arty bullshit, but sometimes they get a lot more on-screen humping than Americans are comfortable with.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Cheaper and Easier to Beat Off to Than Netflix</h3><p></p><p></p><p>The very latest clip features Stacy Martin in The Lady In The Car With Glasses And A Gun. It’s only a one-minute scene, but at least it’s in HD. I don’t speak French, so I’m not sure what the voiceover is saying in the beginning as we’re treating to some sexy photos of this babe. Seconds later, she’s stripping down in front of this angry dude before being mounted.</p><p></p><p>The scene is over before it gets too steamy, which I’m already sure is going to be one of my minor complaints about the site. The short scenes aren’t HeroEro’s fault, but rather a consequence of the format. I’m happy to report that most clips are longer than this one. Right before the French clip was added, they uploaded a 10+ minute Korean scene with a ton of flesh. I don’t see a ton of Korean porno come by my desk, so I was surprised by just how explicit it was.</p><p></p><p>I guess I should admit, I ain’t necessarily a film buff unless we’re talking about reality porn or vintage orgy films. I didn’t realize Amanda Seyfriend and Julianne Moore had a lesbian sex scene together in the movie Chloe, but you’d better believe I enjoyed it with my hands full as soon as I found it on HeroEro. The montage also contains footage of Amanda riding a dude in the flick, saving me the time and effort of renting it and searching through myself.</p><p></p><p>If you ever have a problem deciding what to watch on Hulu, you might be a little overwhelmed trying to decide what to crank it to on HeroEro. The front page shows new vids starring celebs like Charlize Theron, Natalie Portman, and Jennifer Lopez, not to mention a bunch of foreign starlets I’m currently acquainting myself with.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>A Picture Menu of 5,000 Nude Celebs</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Holy shit. The thumbnailed menu of celebrities stretches on and on for hundreds of pages. All together, <strong>they have nearly 5,000 babes on the list so far</strong>. That’s pretty fucking comprehensive, so this is exactly the place to look if you’re searching for a particular nude scene from some obscure actress none of your friends have heard of.</p><p></p><p>A lot of the hottest chicks have multiple scenes on the site. Scarlett Johansson is in nearly 30, and they’ve got 22 with the always beautiful Salma Hayek. There are 16 apiece from Nicole Kidman, Monica Bellucci and Frankie Shaw. Amber Heard is in 15, proof that she’s done more with her life than just pooping on Johnny Depp’s bed.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Fap to the Naked Beauties of Cinema</h3><p></p><p></p><p>I guess I was too busy jacking off to see Sunlight Jr. when it came out. To be honest, I’d never heard of it until I saw it on HeroEro. It’s another short scene running just a few minutes, but Naomi takes it all off to bang Matt Dillon. I heard actresses wear various secret crotch protectors to prevent actual genital contact during these scenes, but dude’s face is right up in there and I’m sure he smells it.</p><p></p><p>Since HeroEro.com posted the best part of the movie, I don’t have to watch the whole thing. <strong>They also have convenient one-click downloads</strong>, so I saved the clip for my permanent collection. It ain’t the hardest hardcore scene in the world, but it’s fucking nice for a celebrity nude scene. Her little tits are gorgeous, and her fuck-me faces always make me hard as a rock.</p><p></p><p>HeroEro.com also has screenshot galleries to go with each of the movie sex scenes. You’ll find some decent screengrabs in there, but they’re really hit or miss. The pics look like they’re grabbed automatically by a machine, and the machine ain’t smart enough to pick out the sex parts. You’ll get a lot of scenery and talking faces mixed in with your lingerie shots and boobies.</p><p></p><p>I have to admit; I got to the HeroEro party a little bit late. I just found out about the joint, but they’ve been building the collection for a few years now. <strong>To date, there are around 30,000 movie sex scenes in the library</strong>. Netflix doesn’t even have 4,000 movies, which helps tell you how impressive HeroEro’s stash is. You ain’t going to get bored or run out of wank material anytime soon.</p><p></p><p>HeroEro.com is one of the web’s better celebrity nude tubes out there. They focus on sex scenes from movies and pull material from films made all over the world, working diligently to build and index a truly world-class selection of masturbatory content. The setup makes it easy as hell to find the scene or actress you want to jack off to, so there’s really no good reason not to spend the rest of your day doing just that.</p>"}},{"id":"60aced13c211","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"60aced13c211","title":"DrunkenStepfather","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"DrunkenStepfather.comDrunken Stepfather is an adult blog.

It’s all about celebs and babes, and almost every post has some nipples, butts or just sexy underwear of girls you know (or may not know). You will find SFW cam girl clips, nip slips, pussy slips, celebs caught in compromising situations and much more. If you are the kind of sick individual that likes peeping under girls’ skirts, wardrobe malfunctions featuring celebs, unintentional displays of pussy and that kind of stuff, welcome home motherfucker.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>First impression</h3><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Site design and navigation</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Everything works perfectly well when it comes to site navigation. The top menu will allow you to access the newsletter, videos, steptv, step news, and step links. For convenience purposes, there is a link to access safe for work content as well as the NSFW. There is a search option at the top right corner, and the site has also included links to their social media pages including Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. One thing I can guarantee you is you will enjoy the time spent here.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Hundreds of posts</h3><p></p><p></p><p>You can enjoy the posts right from the homepage where there is an unending supply of girls intentionally getting naughty while others have either been caught unawares or are merely very good at pretending. Either way, you will love seeing women with wet bikinis, stretching their pussies, displaying their asses, and so much more.</p><p></p><p>Occasionally you will bump upon short videos, and although there is no sex involved, they are clearly not safe for work. There are women out of control with their boobs, others getting totally fucking wasted beyond recognition as they party wildly and pour alcohol all over their titties, others devouring each other’s boobs and such. Sadly, they cannot be downloaded, but they will still provide plenty of erotic entertainment.</p><p></p><p>Posts are accompanied by fitting descriptions just to get you in the mood. In one of the posts titled Sofia Richie New Tits In A Bikini Of The Day, part of the description reads: ‘Sofia Richie the bootleg Kardashian who works on the Kardashian show as one of the Extras that is paid in having some old dirty dick shoved inside of her like the blow-up doll she is…’ Others follow a similar pattern, and you will have a field day sampling various erotic pieces. Below each post is a list of related posts and options for you to leave your reaction, just like on Facebook.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Fun videos</h3><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Daily updates</h3><p></p><p></p><p>You may head over to the step news section where you can crawl through their impressive archive of posts dating as far back as 2009 and for the curious souls, the site’s very first topic was “Cougar Convention In San Francisco Of The Day.”</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Forum</h3><p></p><p></p><p>If the numbers are anything to go by, this place is teeming with active freaks. You can join in on the fun and give your worthless opinion, only that you will need to be a registered user. The process is short and straightforward and will only take a minute of your time. It’s the only way you will be able to view the messages in the subforums anyway so if you want my opinion, get that fucking user account.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>What I love about the site</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Even better, the site has provided a comprehensive list of celebrities, well arranged in alphabetical order for your perusal. Click on any celeb and see their other side they probably don’t want you to see. They include the likes of Beyonce, Alicia Keys, Amy Winehouse, Fergie among many others. The site also has a good mixture of fun and eroticism and will provide the perfect erotic entertainment. Linking the site’s social media pages is also a stroke of genius from the team.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>What I hate about the site</h3><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Suggestions I have for the site</h3><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p></p>"}},{"id":"8e6266bb9651","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"8e6266bb9651","title":"wikiFeet","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"WikiFeet.comWiki Feet is the world's largest collection of celebrity foot photos ever and is constantly expanding and perfecting under thousands of beautiful arches with neatly trimmed toes and the cutest feet you've ever seen.

Ask a dude what his favorite female body part is and you’ll get a handful of expected answers. Guys really like boobies, they like butts, and they’re also usually pretty fond of cooters and hoo-has. Of course, if the room is big enough, you’ll get some other answers thrown in there as well. First and foremost amongst the body part fetishists are the foot fans.</p><p></p><p>What is it about the lower extremities that make them so sexy to so many people? Is it the manicured toes or feminine arches, or is it the fragrant locker-room aroma of skin bacteria breaking down the sweat coming from the pores? Fuck if I know, but WikiFeet is the world’s biggest Internet archive of celebrity feet photos.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Shake Your Dick to Pretty, Famous Feet</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Some of you foot perverts already know where I’m going with this. Nearly every single time you add the word “feet” to your search for Jennifer Lawrence, Ariana Grande, Aubrey Plaza or any other hot famous girl, Google spits out the same top result: WikiFeet.</p><p></p><p>To say they’re the most popular site in the world for foot fanatics may be something of an understatement. They get around 11 million visits per month. That’s a teeny, tiny fraction of Wikipedia’s 5.4 billion, but let’s be honest here. WikiFeet is maybe a little bit smaller in its scope. Wikipedia covers pretty much everything on the sun. WikiFeet only does pretty, famous feet.</p><p></p><p>The two don’t look terribly similar from the front page. Wikipedia is all covered in words, but WikiFeet is mostly pictures of beautiful women. Look a little closer at those thumbnails out front and you’ll see that each and every photo features exposed feet. Some girls are barefoot, others in sandals or open-toed heels. Footwear that obscures those soles, toes and arches have no place here.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Easier to Jerk Off to Than Wikipedia</h3><p></p><p></p><p>At WikiFeet, you type in the name of a beautiful woman who has been sneaking into your masturbatory fantasies, which brings up a gallery of her photos. You stare at those photos, which feature her feet prominently, and you aggressively stroke your penis until climaxing and ejaculating into an old gym sock or a ball of tissues. Now you’re satisfied until your dick gets hard again thanks to your constant obsessing over celebrity pedicures.</p><p></p><p>The Home screen does give you a handful of material to crank it to if you don’t feel like digging in too deep. It’s not a porn site, so there isn’t any hardcore penetration or bouncing titties anywhere, but we all know why you’re loading up the page. It’s because, for whatever reason, painted toenails peeking over the edge of a sandal get you so hard you spend all day dripping in your pants until you can pull up the site. Ain’t nothing wrong with that.</p><p></p><p>The front page features a Random Gallery, as well as the broads who have earned places as their Feet of the Day or Feet of the Week. Today, I’m seeing Nora Ordog, Estee Lalonde, and Valentina Gallego, respectively.</p><p></p><p>One thing you may wonder is, “Who the fuck are all these people?” If it’s supposed to be celebrities, how come there are so many bitches that you don’t recognize at all? Well, it’s actually pretty fucking simple.</p><p></p><p>WikiFeet is an international site, masturbated to by foot fetishists around the world. That’s why you see a ton of different broads from all over the place, and you’re not even going to recognize a lot of them. The site takes user uploads, but they are not catering to your neckbeard obsession with comic movie actresses or the girls from your sitcoms. You’ll find them there, of course, mixed in with a ton of beautiful women you’ve never heard of.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Big Feet, Little Feet, Pretty Feet, Ugly Feet</h3><p></p><p></p><p>When in Rome, though, right? I snorted a Viagra and pulled out a used gym sock I stole from my sister at the last family reunion to help put me in the mood. Then I clicked the Celebrities tab to start digging into the pile.</p><p></p><p>Jesus fucking Christ. WikiFeet has nearly 3500 pages full of celebrities, and each celebrity has their own massive gallery of photographs. Thankfully, they’ve included a bunch of filters to help you sift through all those open-toed wedge photos and barefoot beach pics.</p><p></p><p>One of the first things I did was bump the Popularity filter up to Extremely Popular. That way I’d be sure to only find the chicks with feet worth jizzing all over. Then I adjusted the Site Rating filter all the way up to Beautiful Feet. If you’re a glutton for punishment or just like nasty bitches, you can also slide it down to the Ugly Feet. Who knew?</p><p></p><p>If you’ve got a thing for the womanly feet of a certain country, the Nationality filter will help you narrow down those exotic ladies. It is a shockingly deep list. I was expecting broad categories like continents, but you can narrow it down to individual islands and third-world shit holes. Seriously, every fucking country on the globe is on this list.</p><p></p><p>If there’s a particular shoe size you’re into, there’s a filter for that, too. The range is really fucking wide, from a tiny US size 4 all the way up to a 15. You like big bitches, or little sluts with enormous hobbit feet?</p><p></p><p>The trouble with these filters is that you can only use one of them at a time. I can’t narrow down the American chicks wearing size 7, or the Quite Popular girls with Nice Feet. I can search for girls by Birth Dates, but once I’ve got them I can’t narrow them down to just the popular ones.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>And a Thousand Feet Videos, Too</h3><p></p><p></p><p>The standards are little bit lower here. I see a lot of YouTube videos of Home Shopping Network presenters hyping products that go on their feet. There are scenes pulled from TV shows and movies, and honestly it just seems like random stuff people have found that happen have feet in them. If that’s what gets you off, more power to you, but it would be better and easier to jack off to with some kind of vague organization.</p><p></p><p>WikiFeet has some overall organizational issues, but I guess that can be expected from such a massive site that runs on user uploads. If you’re into feet, there’s no archive on the planet that can compare to WikiFeet.com’s stash of celebrity foot photos or even come close. They may not have porno, but where else are you going to find such an extensive collection of famous chicks with exposed toes? All you foot fetish fanatics who are just discovering the Internet are going to really thank me later.</p>"}},{"id":"93d331ae95b9","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"93d331ae95b9","title":"TheNipSlip","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"TheNipSlip.comThe Nip Slip is a website that shares hot celebrity sex videos with transparent dresses and any indecent photos and videos of celebrities taken by paparazzi.

Here they bring you the naughtiest celebrity nip slips, embarrassing wardrobe malfunctions, the barest of bums, up-skirts, topless candid and more. Anything nasty that involves a celebrity, you will find it here.</p><p></p><p>Nearly every post here is explicit. Whether it is bikini candid featuring Lais Ribeiro, cameltoes featuring high profile names like Lucy Hale, Kourtney Kardashian’s full nudes, nude models and so much more, there will be plenty of naughty photos to browse. Celebrities are not backward when it comes to flashing some flesh, either intentionally or otherwise. That’s why we have to give thanks to the paparazzi who are always on hand to record that nip-slip, side-boob or knicker-flash. TNS is the manifestation.</p><p></p><p>Isn’t it beautiful to live in a world where women are unafraid to show some flesh? Lots of tits get captured on camera these days with little hassle, but there is a special gratification in seeing celebrities in embarrassing moments, and if you are the dude that gets off such moments, there will never be a dull moment with TNS.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>First impression</h3><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Site design and navigation</h3><p></p><p></p><p>It is the site navigation that might cause a few problems. The site seems determined to promote as many third-party sites as possible, and the site is teeming with links leading to outside sources. The top menu, for instance, has 9 links, all of them leading to external websites. If someone in the team thought this would be funny, they are gravely mistaken. Needless to say, you will be confused as to which links to pick and that will obviously ruin your experience. The next/previous browsing menu is also far from ideal especially considering there are loads of pages to browse through. That said, there is a search feature and a list of categories to improve your browsing experience, but ultimately, the navigation won’t have you jumping around in excitement.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>The content</h3><p></p><p></p><p>The pictures are accompanied by telling titles and fitting descriptions to give you a clue about where they were taken. For instance, one of the posts read: Sexy spread of Kourtney Kardashian showing bare ass in the December issue of GQ Mexico! Another featuring Madison Beer reads: The Madison Beer Miami bikini show continues with these candids of her in a lavender bikini at the beach! The camel toe is way better in these ones + bonus pokies as well!</p><p></p><p>Click on ‘see the pictures’ to browse the photos with posts having a differing number of photos. For instance, the Madison Beer camel toe gallery has 20 fap inducing photos, and if you harbored dreams of seeing her naked, this is as close as it gets. Of course, you will thoroughly enjoy the cameltoe. Most of the images are high res although you will have to click on the individual photo to see it in full, in which case you will be directed to the site in the photos are hosted. All in all, you will have access to hundreds of galleries featuring celebs in various levels of nudity for your pleasure.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Videos</h3><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Categories</h3><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>What I love about this site</h3><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>What I hate about this site</h3><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Suggestions I have for this site</h3><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p></p>"}},{"id":"e77cec91b843","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"e77cec91b843","title":"Egotastic","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"Egotastic.com is home to all sexy celebrity gossip leaks and entertainment news.

Well, it is the best film making hub in the world. But I’m not here about that; I’m all about the people Hollywood has made famous. That’s right, the freaking sexy celebrities. The place is an incredible, ideal climate, sunny and mild terrain which makes me be like “I want to see some titties”. Not that we don’t love the movies, just the craving for a little more thrill from the show.</p><p></p><p>When a site is about movie stars, like Egotastic, it would be disappointing not to see some porn, sexy shoots, the holy upskirts and sure all the naughty deeds in Hollywood. Luckily for you, Egotastic doesn’t fall short and instead prefers to mash it up with a little gossip, rumors, and entertainment news. Well, what can I say, just what the doctor ordered!</p><p></p><p></p><h3>The erotic bit of Hollywood</h3><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Simple blog design that works just fine</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Having a simple design doesn’t sum up to an easy navigation journey. On the contrary, it might be quite a tussle moving around as the only major navigation features are the top menu and a search option. Sure, viewing the recently updated pics and videos is a piece of cake by scrolling up and down, but what if you want to dwell on the archives. Categories like “nude celebs only”, “show me sexy” would be in order for this case, it all we come here for. Folks, the content is incredible, and it would be even better with nicer navigation options.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Dick deep into Egotastic</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Still, it is disappointing. However, the neat and straight to the point design eases the pressure. Being a blog-like site, it is easy to check through on the latest especially if you are in a hurry; you can scroll through the main page and get a glimpse of the latest gossip and maybe a little more . But if you got time on your hands, why not take your time and go through section by section.

They sure do keep them coming and updates every day, and we keep consuming that crap.</p><p></p><p>Sexy Hollywood; I have to agree, sexy Hollywood is way better than just Hollywood. I bet it is actually this place is so fancy. You wouldn’t know that until you see it yourself, and Egotastic is the best platform for just that.</p><p></p><p>Simple design; a blog format is simple. It would be a shame to offer the goodies on a complex platform that confuses the users. Kudos folks, the trick works just right.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>The ugly</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Ads and pop-ups; yeah these are the worst. This platform has the weirdest adverts I have ever seen; I would rather not. The pop-ups too are a nuisance, and I’m sure everyone prefers a clean experience.</p><p></p><p>No porn; the platform is not about porn, but who would mind a little twist. In any case, that would be far much better than the movie trailers.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>What I think should be done</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Remove ads; everybody hates those, just do it already folks.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Final Remarks</h3><p></p>"}},{"id":"e2211e51cc22","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"e2211e51cc22","title":"TaxiDriverMovie","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"Taxidrivermovie.comTaxi Driver Movie is a colorful porn site that focuses on sharing all the best and latest celebrity under-skirt scenery and leggings content.

Sometimes you just don’t want to settle for the easy, low hanging fruit. No, I’m not talking about that GILF down the street with the massive water-balloon tits. Pornstars are easy. Same with cam girls. You can hit up any porn site and watch do all sorts of kinky shit, but where’s the thrill? You’re supposed to see their tits, ass, and pussy. They’re not shy about that shit. Even the amateur content is meant for your eyes. The good shit is the stuff you were never meant to see. The accidental flash, upskirt, and nip slip. I’m talking about celebrity mistakes. There’s nothing like getting a secret glimpse at Jennifer Aniston’s panties as she bends over. I’d say getting a look at her nips was great, but just check out any episode of Friends and you’ll get plenty of that.</p><p></p><p>Celebrity slip-ups are more common than you’d think. There are thousands of moments caught on camera revealing exactly what they don’t want you to see. Often these pictures are behind premium paywalls, but have I got a treat for you today. Taxidrivermovie.com houses a huge catalog of free pinned porn images of all of your favorite actresses, singers, stars, and more! I’ve got no idea why the site takes on the theme and title of the 1976 classic mystery film Taxi Driver, but whatever. Doesn’t make any damn sense to me, but maybe I need to see the movie.</p><p></p><p>Anyway, this site is a decent contender as far as pin porn sites go. It’s got a solid monthly following at around 3 million site views. The site itself has been around since early 2004, so they have had plenty of time to beef up their catalog of sexy, celebrity mistakes. Now, the actual Taxi Driver movie has a pretty high rating on Rotten Tomatoes with a 98 percent. I have my doubts, but let’s see if the site lives up to the legacy of its namesake.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Basic Front Page, But Lacking in Useful Search Options</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Looking around the front page, I found that you can’t even sort these images by anything except for category. No sort by rating, newest, top, etc. At least there are categories, but even those are pretty slim. You’ve got “Cameltoe, Movies, Nip Slip, Safe for Work, See Through, Topless, and Upskirt.” Honestly, that’s not a huge selection even for a niche site like this. Oh, and I don’t know how they consider the “Safe for Work” section to actually be SFW. It’s got see-through outfits and upskirts just the same as the other pages. I don’t think many offices would consider that appropriate.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Previews Don’t Give Enough Information About the Gallery</h3><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Ton of Ads Disguised as Categories and Menu Options</h3><p></p><p></p><p>The only real menu this site has that is usable is the categories tab. All of the other tabs take you off-site to somewhere else, so we’re going to ignore that shit. We’re here for the celebrity nudes! When you click through on an image, you have a few options. You can scroll through and check them all out in a row. You can “zoom” in on them and flip through like a gallery, but the zoom function just made the pictures appear smaller than they originally did for me. You can favorite it, comment, or share it to social media if you want.</p><p></p><p>When you scroll past all of the photos, there will be a list of links that take you offsite for some reason. Lots of hidden ads here. Below those are a block of “suggested for you” images that all take you to different sites as well. At the bottom where the comments are, you can pin the image and follow the poster. I feel like that should be up top with all of the other buttons. It’s all ass backwards here. I did find that there is a little bit more in the way of search options if you use their search bar. You can type in a name and search by category, and most recent or most popular. Still not a lot, but better than nothing.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Some Nice Profile Features, But No Visible Way to Upload Content</h3><p></p><p></p><p>The mobile site is alright. It works, but it’s laid out weird. The previews are really big, and you have to scroll and scroll and scroll to get through anything. I don’t have that kind of time if I’m trying to get a quick nut. Having almost zero search options doesn’t help. The ads suck on mobile as well. All of the same shit I mentioned above though. At least they don’t try and push notifications. But the galleries load up just fine and the rest of the site works.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>MissAVDH’s Favorite Features</h3><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>MissAVDH’s Suggestions</h3><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>MissAVDH’s Final Thoughts</h3><p></p>"}},{"id":"958c21d4c436","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"958c21d4c436","title":"CelebKingdom","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"CelebKingdom.org collects a lot of nude and semi-nude celebrity pornography but the website design is dull and lacks text content pop-up ads are a headache","canonical":"https://theporndude.com/zh/13303/celebkingdom","affiliate_url":"https://celebkingdom.org/","rating":4,"siteOrder":21,"price":"free","tags":[],"features":[],"categories":[{"id":"the-fappening","collection":"categories_en"}],"screenshot_url":"https://cdn.staticstack.net/assets/img/r-thumbs/eebe668-celebkingdom_small.png","image_alt":"CelebKingdom, nude photo website","scraped_at":"2025-10-28T17:12:26.285Z","iconSpritesheet":"custom-favicon-spritesheet.png","iconPosition":"-432px -672px","iconClassName":"ctm-icon13303","logoIconClass":"icon13303","pros":["a decent collection of dick-hardening content of nude celebrities","a well-functioning gallery system that lets you browse photos flawlessly"],"cons":["the huge pop-up ad on every page quickly becomes a pain in the ass","the overall design of celebkingdom.org is boring as fuck","there’s a disappointing lack of written content accompanying each celeb"],"detailedDescription":"<p>Celeb Kingdom! These days, porn has never been so easy to access. We can open our laptops and access some of the most hardcore gangbang porn imaginable at the click of a mouse. If we’re seeking something even more convenient, we can pull the smartphone out of our pocket and open up a two-hour porn movie in 4K, and jerk off anytime, anywhere. What a time to be alive!</p><p></p><p>However, things weren’t always this straightforward. It wasn’t long ago that many of us were forced to rely on semi-erotic Hollywood movies as a source of wanking fuel. I fondly remember burning out my copy of Basic Instinct due to the number of times I reminded it to catch a glimpse of pussy in the interrogation scene.</p><p></p><p>Others would go undercover and seek out copies of sex tapes released by celebrities or try to find photos that showed them flashing their pussies as they got out of cars and shit. Desperate times called for desperate measures, my friends.</p><p></p><p>But just because we’re now granted flawless access to hardcore smut from anywhere with an internet connection (and potentially a VPN), that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t keep in touch with our roots and remember the countless hours of wanking fuel that celebrities have given us. I’m not alone in this opinion, either. I recently realized this when I came across a site called Celebkingdom.org.</p><p></p><p>From Salma Hayek and Lindsay Lohan to Gal Gadot and Amber Heard, this is a site that is said to have curated a wank-worthy collection of celebrity porn in all of its forms, whether it’s some famous chick sunning her exposed tits on a beach or a particularly passionate sex scene in a movie that is on the verge of being porn-grade.</p><p></p><p>However, that’s what I’ve heard from the porn rumors on the street, but whether it’s true or not is a different story. But the truth is what I’m going to be seeking out today! Well, that and some dripping-wet celebrity pussy! My mission is to go more close-up into this site than most people did to their TV screens when they first saw Michelle Pfieffer’s exposed twat in Basic Instinct.</p><p>Now, let’s get stuck in!</p><p></p><p></p><h3>What is Celebkingdom.org?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>It’s a straightforward site with not a lot of background history to it. Still, there have been more than a few times in the past when I’ve been blown away by a site that doesn’t look too impressive at first glance, so let’s dive deeper into Celebkingdom.org and see if this is one of them.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>What’s the Nude Celebrity Porn Like on Celebkingdom.org?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>● Margot Robbie - This blonde beauty needs no introduction and is a celebrity I have to feature in this list by order of every horny dick on earth. Celebkingdom.org’s tribute to Robbie features everything from her notorious pussy teasing scene in The Wolf of Wall Street to her sexy bikini snaps from beach vacations. Holy fuck, the things we’d all do to be Leonardo Dicaprio staring into the valley of pink pleasure in the former film!</p><p>● Miley Cyrus - Next up, we have the famous singer who has a penchant for getting her titties out! Celebkingdom.org has built up a decent collection of nude Miley Cyrus snaps, from her topless sunbathing antics to the times when she has blatantly flashed her chesticles at a camera.</p><p>● Sofia Vergara - If ever there was a queen of Latinas, then it’s Sofia Vergara. Sadly, there’s a significant lack of any truly NSFW content of this iconic Colombian actress, but Celebkingdom.org has tried its best to gather as much dick-melting content of her as possible, such as her semi-topless shot of her covering her Latina tits with her hands and bikini snaps of her on a beach with her cleavage bursting out of her swimwear. This chick is fuckin’ kryptonite to any swinging dick who lusts after Latinas.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>The Design of the Site</h3><p></p><p></p><p>The site begins with a dark gray header bar home to a dull-looking menu in generic text. The menu takes you to an explore page, a list of the most-visited content, and the most recent photos to be added to the site. Additionally, there’s a search bar for you to seek out any particular nude celebrities you and your horny cock have in mind.</p><p></p><p>The site’s homepage then starts with a visually engaging portfolio of the numerous famous personalities featured on the site. These are displayed in rows of six thumbnails and are accompanied by the celebrity's name, along with a ticker showing how many photos or albums are contained within.</p><p></p><p>When you click on a celebrity to see more, you’re presented with an identical format as the homepage. This time, however, it showcases either different albums or various photos featured within. There’s also a gallery feature that displays the images in a pop-up window that lets you scroll through them with a set of arrow controls in the top right-hand corner.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>What I Like Most About it</h3><p></p><p></p><p>The gallery function on the site isn’t the smoothest one I’ve ever encountered. Still, it does do an adequate job of letting you explore the various XXX celebrity content across the site, and scrolling through different images is straightforward.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>What I Don’t Like</h3><p></p><p></p><p>It’s also impossible to ignore the lack of imagination that has gone into the site's design. Celebkingdom.org doesn’t even have a logo or stand-out features to make it memorable, and it desperately needs an aesthetic overhaul.</p><p></p><p>There’s also a disappointing lack of background info on the featured celebrities and models. For example, there’s one particular chick featured with a smashing pair of boobs who is dressed in an erotic uniform with an obscure name that yields no results when you search for her on Google. So, who the fuck is she? On top of that, nude scenes of celebrities often don’t tell people the origin of the scene so they can see it for themselves.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Suggestions I Have for Celebkingdom.org</h3><p></p><p></p><p>You’ve clearly invested a lot of time and effort into the content on the site, so it’s now time to do the same with the design. The overall style of Celebkingdom.org does nothing to get your cock pumping, it’s not optimized, and it doesn’t welcome you in at all. I’d suggest overhauling the site's design to something more modern and memorable as soon as possible.</p><p></p><p>While the visual content of nude celebrities and well-known personalities is excellent, the best way to compliment them is by adding some written information about each featured. You could really beef up this site’s content and SEO by adding a short bio of each celebrity featured, links to their work, and their naughtiest on-screen performances or their hottest moments caught on camera.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p></p>"}},{"id":"07f27adb159b","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"07f27adb159b","title":"CelebHub","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"CelebHub.net is a growing library of free sexy celebrity content including hottest actresses singer models influencer people and athletes pictures GIF videos","canonical":"https://theporndude.com/zh/10621/celebhub","affiliate_url":"https://celebhub.net/","rating":4,"siteOrder":22,"price":"free","tags":["免费"],"features":[],"categories":[{"id":"the-fappening","collection":"categories_en"}],"screenshot_url":"https://cdn.staticstack.net/assets/img/r-thumbs/755a62a-celebhub_small.png","image_alt":"CelebHub, nude photo website","scraped_at":"2025-10-28T17:12:32.861Z","iconSpritesheet":"custom-favicon-spritesheet.png","iconPosition":"-128px -544px","iconClassName":"ctm-icon10621","logoIconClass":"icon10621","pros":["celebrity nudes, sexy pics and videos","a great range of actresses, singers, models, influencers and athletes","well organized","a nice media player","thousands of pics, gifs and vids"],"cons":["spam","no easy downloads"],"detailedDescription":"<p>The logo for Celeb Hub looks a lot like the one for Pornhub, which set some high expectations even before I started poking around. Of course, it ain’t uncommon to copycat off what might be the most popular internet porn site of all time. As a professional smut reviewer, I see that kind of thing pretty much every day. What’s less common, though, is the volume of traffic Celebhub is getting. With a couple hundred thousand visitors stopping by every month, it’s pretty obvious these guys might have something worth busting out the lube and cum-sock for.</p><p></p><p>As you’ve probably already guessed from the title, <strong>Celebhub.net is a library of sexy photos and videos featuring the hottest famous chicks in the world</strong>. I’ll go ahead and tell you up front that while similar sites sometimes focus exclusively on the most perverted bits of X-rated content, nudes and sex tapes, Celebhub takes a more inclusive approach. There ain’t necessarily an exposed nipple or stretched-out pussy in every single update, but the goal is still to keep you hard and cranking to your favorite celebrities. Let me tell you how my visit went this morning.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Gawking at Celebs at Celeb Hub</h3><p></p><p></p><p>There’s a selection of Trending Celebs presented front and center at the top of the front page. They’ve got tons of gorgeous actresses, singers, models, influencers and athletes. That front-page spread includes girls like Jenna Ortega, Billie Eilish, Ariana Grande, Kylie Jenner and Bella Porch. You only see their pretty faces in the headshots out front, but I started getting hard right away as I envisioned what was on the other side of those links.</p><p></p><p>I like how they give you a handful of other categories to peruse, with selections pasted out on the front page. You might spin by hoping for a fap to Busty Celebs (like Sasha Alexander), get distracted by the Gen Z Celebs (with girls like Sydney Sweeney) and then completely fall down the rabbit hole of Latina Celebs (Melissa Fumero, Addison Rae and AJ Lee, just to name three). Further down the page and under the More menu, they’ve got Blonde Celebs, Brunette Celebs, Redhead Celebs, plus a handful of other subgenres of beautiful rich women.</p><p></p><p>It's obvious even before I started digging that <strong>Celeb Hub does a great job categorizing their content</strong>. Celebrity nude sites and WordPress porn blogs often drop the ball when it comes to tagging the material, which ultimately leads to a collection that’s harder to search and harder to browse. Whoever’s running this joint is taking the time to fill out the stats for each babe, which is going to make it a hell of a lot easier to find something to beat off to, even if you don’t have a particular celebrity in mind.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Your Favorite Celebs in Various States of Undress</h3><p></p><p></p><p>What I really came for is listed below the bio: Florence Pugh Nude Photos and Videos. They keep the actual images hidden until you click the Show button, at which point I was greeted with a GIF of Florence playing with herself on webcam. It’s not super explicit and I don’t know what movie it’s from, but goddamn, it sure made all the blood go rushing to my dick.</p><p></p><p>I was expecting the same kind of gallery view that I usually find on every other celebrity nude site, but <strong>Celebhub.net has a nice little baked-in media viewer that displays both images and videos</strong>. After the simulated webcam show, I started flicking through more sexy scenes, hot photos and social media vids. Honestly, I had no idea Florence had done this much topless stuff, but I’m thrilled about finding it. This is totally going to fuck up my productivity for the day.</p><p></p><p>The media player has some nice features like auto-play, shuffle, a gride mode and the option to show only NSFW content. If I have one immediate complaint about the setup, though, it’s that there’s no easy, readily apparent way to download anything. There’s a Download button, but I only got a dead link when I clicked it. Celebrity nude fans are often collectors of the stuff, but Celeb Hub doesn’t offer any simple way to fill up your hard drive. Sorry, guys.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>I Love Celebrities and Their Boobs</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Madelyn Cline has the top slot under Actresses right now, which makes sense given Glass Onion just came out, putting the hottie in the limelight. I don’t always know my Hollywood chicks as well as I know my famous video whores, but Madelyn’s Celebhub profile helped me get a bit more familiar with her work. There are some several-second GIFs of the athletic blonde just running, and holy fuck, I could watch those boobies bounce all day.</p><p></p><p>I was kind of blown away by just how much Madelyn content was included. The media player initially lists a couple dozen pieces, which is great, but I got more every time I clicked the Load More button. The layout of Celebhub makes it difficult to count the precise amount of content, but there are easily thousands of pics, GIFs and vids when you consider the long-ass list of celebs and how much they’ve got filed away for each lovely lady. There’s no ”New” section, either, so I can’t tell you exactly how fast they’re updating the collection with new stuff.</p><p></p><p>Underneath Madelyn’s media player, Celebhub suggested a handful of Similar Nude Celebs. It’s mostly blonde chicks like Kaley Cuoco, Pamela Anderson and Caylee Cowan. Cindy Crawford is listed, too, probably because she’s listed as American and Athletic, just like Madelyn. Remember how I mentioned the importance of tagging content on a site like this? It ain’t always apparent to the end masturbator like yourself, but the setup here is going to make for easy fap sessions as they direct you to more celebs you might want to shake your dick at.</p><p></p><p>I followed a link under Madelyn’s content to Peyton List’s Celeb Hub stash. I wasn’t even familiar with the babe until today, but she’s got a pretty face, a tight body, and couple dozen bikini clips that made me an instant fan. I didn’t see anything terribly filthy in her stash, but I’ll definitely be keeping my eye out from now on.</p><p></p><p>I did run into a little bit of spam early on in my Celeb Hub visit today, with a couple pop-ups getting blocked by my plugin as I tried clicking my way around. The issue resolved after a few minutes of browsing, probably because my adblocker was learning the ropes. I recommend using an adblocker whenever you’re using the web, whether you’re jacking off, looking at social media or just doing your boring-ass work.

Still, it was a fountain of wanking fuel in our time of need and one that should never be forgotten.</p><p></p><p>But even though we live in a renewed golden age of hardcore porn, there are plenty of folks out there who still retain their adoration for the world of celebrity porn, and, luckily for them, there’s an ample array of porn sites out there that strive to cater to their need to see some celebrity tits and pussy.</p><p></p><p>Still, it’s not all roses because some of these sites can be totally shit-tier. That’s why I’m here to guide you through them all and show you which celebrity porn platforms are capable of changing how we view some of the most famous chicks in the world of film and TV. And today, I’m bringing you into the porn pits of a site called Celebfapper.com.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>What is Celebfapper.com?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Now, I went deep into the history of Celebfapper.com on the Wayback Machine because, as you’ll soon find out, I didn’t have a choice! The site has a checkered porn history that goes all the way back to the summer of 2016, and it has been balls-deep in the world of celebrity porn for nigh on a decade.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>What’s the Celebrity Porn Like on Celebfapper.com?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>1. Kerry Katona’s Porn Pics - Let’s kick off with the gorgeous Kerry Katona. Now, if you’re not from the UK, then you might not know her well, but she was a TV personality and a member of the pop group Atomic Kitten back in the day. Nowadays, she has branched out into the world of OnlyFans and delivered people with the chance to have some atomic wanks! She might be getting on in years, but she has looked after her body and is packing some of the hottest English tits you’ve ever seen. Her porn pictures featured on Celebfapper.com show everything from her slutty lingerie photos to her naked hot tub pictures that give us a solid shot of her wet pussy and naked tits.</p><p>2. Julia Calsing Can Melt Your Cock With Ease - And now, let’s take a look at the featured NSFW pictures of Julia Calsing. A well-known influencer with a booming fanbase, the pictures of Julia on Celebfapper.com are the kind of stuff that really wouldn’t fly on mainstream social media platforms. Often dressed in porn-grade lingerie or bikinis, her massive ass and chunky tits leap out in your face, and she looks like a walking fuck doll that any man worth his salt would do anything to slide his cock balls-deep inside. Her pictures are made even hotter by the slutty eye contact she always makes with the camera because this naughty little slut knows how hot she is and is well aware that her snaps are making countless cocks melt the moment she posts them online.</p><p>3. Cibelly Ferreira Has a Perfect Thigh Gap - There are a lot of sexual rumors surrounding women with red hair, and Cibelly is a flame-haired slut who is doing a fine job of making them stronger. Her pictures on Celebfapper.com show her posing in front of her bathroom mirror and showing off her suckable tits and her equally fuckable pussy. Now, Cibelly has one of the hottest thigh gaps you’ve ever seen, and it’s the perfect space for you to put your face between and suck on her labia for hours on end. No doubt Cibelly would find the energy to ride your face all night long, too!</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Design of the Site</h3><p></p><p></p><p>You’ll then see an array of the latest NSFW photos and GIFs of featured celebrities on the site. This section details the girls in sets of five and is followed by a selection of six videos with the girl’s name and the video duration underneath. Finally, you’ll then see a selection of the latest celebrity porn albums on the site.</p><p></p><p>Clinging to the right-hand side of Celebfapper.com’s homepage is a sidebar that brings your attention to a celebrity-themed game called ‘’Guess the celeb!’’ and it tasks you with identifying girls like Doja Cat and Rita Ora. You’ll also see buttons for you to add your own album to the site and a link to a third-party site specializing in porn games.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>What I Like Most About it</h3><p></p><p></p><p>And some of the celebrity porn content on Celebfapper.com is more than hot enough for you to bust a nut over. So, I was happy to see that the site was able to display them in a way that allows you to absorb all of the sticky details, whether it’s a glistening Latina cunt or a meaty pair of English tits with a delicate glaze of post-sex sweat clinging to them.</p><p></p><p>You’ll also notice a firm pattern amongst the girls featured on Celebfapper.com. Some of them are well-known in the Portuguese-speaking world, whether it’s in Portugal, Brazil, or Angola, and there are plenty of others who have earned a wild reputation in the English-speaking nations of the world. Luckily, Celebfapper.com has two handy transition buttons at the bottom of the site that let you switch the language between English and Portuguese.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>What I Don’t Like</h3><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Suggestions I Have for Celebfapper.com</h3><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p></p><p></p><p>But the elephant in the room is the fact that the site wasn’t online at the time of writing. Whatever shit is going on behind the scenes with this site's hosting, it needs to be sorted out as soon as possible, or its current rankings and SEO will go down the sink quicker than the cum being spat out of a chick who is more of a spitter than a quicker.</p>"}},{"id":"52ca2fcb55cf","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"52ca2fcb55cf","title":"NudeCelebForum","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"NudeCelebForum.comNude Celeb Forum is a website that specializes in sharing exclusive private photos of the most popular celebrities.

As much as I love adult message boards like the Phun Forum, F95Zone and PeachyForum, noobs don’t have any idea what they’re getting into unless somebody tells them or they take a look for themselves. It’s a tradeoff that can pay off if you manage to get popular enough, but it’s still a gamble for a porn webmaster.</p><p></p><p>The straightforward title seems to have paid off here, attracting exactly the celeb-loving demographic they were shooting for. NudeCelebForum.com gets more than a million visitors a month, which certainly ain’t chump change. As you’ve no doubt inferred from the name, <strong>it’s a message board devoted to celebrity nudes</strong>, so those high traffic stats are a great sign. Let’s take a closer look and see what all these starfuckers are chatting about.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Celebrity Nudes Over the Decades</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Honestly, most of you ain’t going to give much of a fuck about what message board software they’re running on. Bulletin boards have been around since the early days of the internet, and they haven’t changed much. Nude Celeb Forum’s current software was launched back in 2010, which might be a bummer if we were talking about a high-end paysite or porn game library. Forums don’t have to look fancy, and typically never do.</p><p></p><p>Elaborate presentations don’t count for much on a message board, but the numbers do. Those million visitors I mentioned ain’t just lurking, but taking part in the community and the conversation. This place is truly hopping, with over 400 members online as I whip up this review on a Tuesday afternoon. The Forum Statistics out front paint a picture of eager engagement, with 1.2 million messages in more than 75,000 threads.</p><p></p><p>You can poke around and see the content in most of the main subforums without signing up for an account, so I was gawking at babes like Selma Hayek, Kendall Jenner and Billie Eilish within minutes of typing NudeCelebForum.com into my browser. They’ll even let unregistered guests click the links to the full-size images and videos. That said, full access to the whole stash does require membership. Registration is free and fast, so you’re just a few clicks and an email away from the full show.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Let’s Look at Naked Famous Chicks</h3><p></p><p></p><p>To me, and presumably to most other members, the real meat of this nudie forum sandwich are the subforums listed in their Celebrity Content Vault. Most users are here because they’re horny and love famous chicks, after all. To that end, <strong>you’ll find an insane volume of free celebrity nudes and videos</strong>.</p><p></p><p>I figured I’d start my tour where the most action is. The Babes and Glamour Models board currently has over a quarter of a million messages, more than double what you’ll find in second place, Celebrity Pictures. Nearly all the threads in the first two pages of the subforum have had fresh replies, some as recently as ten minutes ago.</p><p></p><p>Lucy Zara has been popping up in my masturbatory rounds a lot lately, so I zeroed in on a very active thread about the babe. One of the wild things about NudeCelebForum is how long some of these threads have been running. The first post in this one was added way back in 2011, and it’s still getting plenty of attention in 2024.</p><p></p><p>This type of long-term documentation offers a killer timeline of content that you’d be hard pressed to find elsewhere. Lucy’s thread starts off with dirty photos and downloadable BDSM galleries, and then progresses to full-on porn scenes.</p><p></p><p>In case you were wondering, yes, you can download the videos, too. NudeCelebForum.com has a shit ton of free download links, making it a goldmine for collectors of celebrity smut. You’ve got space on your hard drive, right? If not, it might be time for an upgrade…</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Oops, I Did It Again!</h3><p></p><p></p><p>I’ve been jacking off to Britney Spears longer than I like to admit. Before you get any weird ideas, keep in mind she’s been legal for a good 23 years now, you fucking perverts. The NudeCelebForum video board has a 16-page thread of clips dating back to 2012, and I wanted a closer look.</p><p></p><p>You don’t have to be a pop culture expert or a pornography enthusiast like myself to know that Britney has never done porn, nor has she ever posed nude in Playboy or had a sex tape “accidentally” uploaded to the internet. Despite the name, Nude Celeb Forum features a ton of content that’s not actually nude, but sexy enough to whack off to. That’s what you’ll find in the Britney thread.</p><p></p><p>Even though the first post in the thread is nearly a decade old, the download links still work. Dead links are a major issue on a lot of long-standing forums and sex blogs, but the mods here do a fucking hell of a job keeping links updated and removing the dead ones. You can still download a clip of Britney answering questions on the David Letterman show way back in the day.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Whacking Off to Nude Celeb Forum</h3><p></p><p></p><p>I found a deepfake video of Natalie Portman playing with a purple vibrator, and I really wanted to watch the whole thing. NudeCelebForum doesn’t actually host any of the content, so the link directed me to a file locker service. If there’s any downside to using the site, this is it.</p><p></p><p>You already know the drill if you’ve ever used a porn download blog or a forum like this one. If you’re downloading without a premium file locker account, you’ll have some extra wait times and maybe some spam along the way. The Natalie video was only a couple hundred megs, but it’s going to take me almost 25 minutes to download. I guess I’ll have to keep beating off to celebrity photos while I’m waiting. Fortunately, I’ve already got a huge archive opened up in my browser.</p><p></p><p>NudeCelebForum.com wouldn’t have survived this long if it was trash. To the contrary, the fact that a fairly basic message board can survive in this increasingly high-tech world of AI porn sites and virtual reality sex experiences tells you a lot about the strength of the community and the popularity of the material they’re posting. Message boards often get overlooked, but a good one like this can be an even better source for celebrity nudes than the free tubes and gallery sites out there. If you don’t believe me, take a look for yourself.</p>"}},{"id":"c500a0dc81b4","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"c500a0dc81b4","title":"The Fappening Forum","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"TheFappeningBlog.comforum is probably the largest and busiest message board on the web that specializes in celebrity nudes with thousands of users every day","canonical":"https://theporndude.com/zh/11591/thefappeningforum","affiliate_url":"https://thefappeningblog.com/forum/","rating":4,"siteOrder":25,"price":"free","tags":[],"features":[],"categories":[{"id":"the-fappening","collection":"categories_en"},{"id":"best-porn-forums","collection":"categories_en"}],"screenshot_url":"https://cdn.staticstack.net/assets/img/r-thumbs/a83ba72-thefappeningforum_small.png","image_alt":"The Fappening Forum, nude photo website","scraped_at":"2025-10-28T17:12:50.310Z","iconSpritesheet":"default","logoIconClass":"icon1929","pros":["thriving forum devoted to celebrity nudes","tons of activity","free, easy signup","celebrity nudes galore","free download links for videos"],"cons":["registration required to see everything (free)","videos hosted on file locker services"],"detailedDescription":"<p>I spent the morning on The Fappening Blog’s forum, and boy, are my arms tired! It ain’t uncommon for a porn site, blog, or basically any online endeavor to include a message board, but it’s rarely more than just a little sideshow to the main event. This one’s something of an outlier in that it’s arguably one of the site’s main draws. Hell, I wouldn’t be surprised if some of those forum members are skipping the blog and heading straight for the conversation and all the boobies within.</p><p></p><p>I’ve written about TheFappeningBlog.com here at MissAVDH a time or two, as it’s long held the number one position among the celebrity nude sites on my list of Fappening sites. Even if you’ve never read my review or even heard of me, there’s a good chance you know the joint. They’re one of the original sites specializing in naked famous ladies, and still get a good 22 million visits per month. Today, I’m going to take a nice, long, close and hard look at their <strong>thriving forum of celebrity smut</strong>. I hope I brought enough lube!</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Fapping to the Fappening Forum</h3><p></p><p></p><p>If you’ve ever dipped your toes into one, perhaps hoping for some insight on the women or a little bit of extra porn, you know what a shitshow they can be. I can’t count the lame, hilarious forums I’ve seen with nothing but the occasional post from a sad guy complimenting the pornstars and desperately hoping they’ll read his message and fall in love. Other times, it’s all basement dwellers posting dick pics with the same pathetic goal in mind.</p><p></p><p>TheFappeningBlog’s forum definitely ain’t cut from the same cloth. <strong>This is a legit discussion forum with a fucking ton of activity</strong>. I’m writing this on a Wednesday afternoon and there are over a thousand members online, including around 450 members and more than 600 guests. The full member count is over half a million.</p><p></p><p>They list some Forum Statistics out on the front page, and they’re similarly impressive. As of this writing, they’ve got nearly half a million messages in over 55,000 threads. It’s definitely worth noting here that while The Fappening Blog has been around since 2017, the forum itself has seen some updates and revisions along the way. If I’m reading the numbers right, the current spread of threads and subforums only date back to 2019.</p><p></p><p>That fat number of guests online today hints at the setup of the forum a little bit. Unregistered lurkers don’t congregate in these numbers without something worth gawking at, so yeah, you can view quite a lot of the posts and the content without signing up for an account. That said, full access does require a membership. Without one, you won’t be able to see all the images, and you ain’t going to see the full-size attachments anywhere.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, signup is quick, easy and free. Just offer up the same sacrificial email address you’d give them anywhere else. The verification step today asked me to name a Kardashian whose first name begins with a K, which shouldn’t be too tough if you’ve beaten off to any celebrity nudes in the last couple decades. The confirmation link slid into my DMs in a matter of seconds, and then I was in TheFappeningBlog.com’s forum.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Naked Famous Chicks You Know and Love</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Overall, though, the setup will seem very familiar to anybody who’s visited any type of online discussion board on any topic. The Fappening Forum divides their discussions into a handful of categories like Nude and Sexy Photos and Videos, Models and Community. These sections are further divided into subforums devoted to content types and sources.</p><p></p><p>If you’ve been shaking your dick at your computer screen or iPhone over the last few years, you’ve no doubt noticed the rise of social media porn content. These days, many of the posts at TheFappeningBlog.com have their roots on sites like OnlyFans and Instagram, which also have their own hopping subforums on The Fappening Forum. In fact, their OnlyFans board is one of the busiest, with over a hundred thousand messages in 13k threads.</p><p></p><p>From a porn reviewer and professional masturbator’s perspective, the massive shift in the porn scene has been interesting to watch. It’s also no big surprise to see The Fappening Blog dancing along the edge of this sea change, because they were always a low-key trendsetter in the world of online porn. The Fappening changed the world of celebrity porn in a massive way that can be compared to the shift we’ve seen OnlyFans bringing.</p><p></p><p>You could say The Fappening Forum is ahead of the curve, which is why I was a little surprised by how small their Deepfake Porn board is. It’s only got a few threads, including one lamenting the fact that most of the big AI porn generators specifically ban creating fake celebs. (I’ve reviewed a number of these services on my list of AI Porn Sites, and while that’s often a listed prohibition, many of them seem perfectly capable of breaking their own rules.) On the other hand, their Fake Celebrity Nude and Deepfakes board has decent traffic, with posts today about Elizabeth Olsen and some other famous babes.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Can’t Get Enough Celebrity Nudes?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>I dipped into their Celebrity Nude Photos board, which currently has almost 44 thousand messages. Active threads today include “discussions” on Riley Reid, Gina Barrett, Jennifer Lawrence and Stana Katic. It’s worth mentioning that TheFappeningBlog has an international userbase, which means you ain’t going to be limited to babes who are only famous in the USA.</p><p></p><p>I’ve always been crazy about Jennifer Lawrence, so I checked out her thread. There are nudie screencaps from flicks like Mother, Red Sparrow, No Hard Feelings, and a couple that look like home movies I’ve never seen. They even provide free download links so you can save your favorites for later.</p><p></p><p>There is one small catch, which you already know about if you’re a regular on any porn-sharing message board. TheFappeningBlog doesn’t host any of the videos themselves, so you’ll have to grab the clips from filehost services like Pastebin and Keep2Share. It saves the webmasters on their bandwidth bill, but the end user will run into some small hurdles along the way. Namely, you’ll have to wait for limited downloads at slow speeds. No biggie, especially for free fap fodder.</p><p></p><p>TheFappeningBlog.com looks unassuming as hell considering how popular they are, and what a fantastic source of celebrity nudes they’ve been for years now. The Fappening Forum is a major part of that formula, helping to build a thriving community of fans and photo swappers. Much of the content that hits the front page of the blog is featured on the forum first, so it’s a little like going backstage at a strip club staffed entirely by famous chicks. Who wouldn’t want to be a part of this club?</p>"}},{"id":"20ca32b7cdbe","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"20ca32b7cdbe","title":"CelebNSFW Reddit","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"This is a sub-station on Reddit.com that focuses on sharing sexy photos of girls.

A website like Reddit doesn't need a very long introduction, but you know very well that I'm about to do it, seeing as MissAVDH is very fond of kicking his reviews off in such a manner. This page has become well-known for a specific kind of humor and a specific type of things people get turned on by, Naturally, it is quite obvious that Reddit isn't the kind of website to be used as a place to deposit pictures of hot babes and such things, at least not primarily, but there are certain sections that are used for such a purpose. Now, don't get me wrong, there are pictures of naked dudes in some of the sections on Reddit as well, as they do not discriminate against genders, but this section is going to be all about girls, pretty much.</p><p></p><p>I mean, women are a treasure, no matter how much they can piss us off every now and then, They are the most beautiful creatures we have on this Earth, and for such reasons, stashes such as the one for NSFW celebrities exist on Reddit. Now, if you're not that familiar with Reddit itself, I think that you deserve a little introduction so that you know what this page is all about and how it works out!</p><p></p><p>First off, there are tons of boards on the website (which shouldn't matter to you much, seeing as we're sticking to a board that is all about nude celebrities showing off their bodies), and every single one of them has a bunch of moderators, Now, every single one of these dudes, for the most part, is an absolute asshole. These moderators are out there to ruin your life and to fuck with the things you post on the website, however, this won't matter much to you seeing as you, a good person will stick to posting things that are nothing but on-topic things. Isn't that right? Well, you better, unless you want to be slapped with a ban-hammer, and once this is done, you won't be able to enjoy a huge stash of celebrity porn, which is indeed a shame. There are some permanent bans that are given out here and there, but there are many temporary bans, but trust me, once you have developed an acquired taste for tasteful nudity you get to see on these boards, then you will regret being removed from one of the best forums on the internet.</p><p></p><p>So, to put it short, this is basically (at least this board) a board that is entirely dedicated to nude pictures of hot celebrity girls, but you need to act nice if you end up creating an account on the page, as the administrators are very active, and they are not afraid of bitch-slapping someone over the internet if that is what they see as something that has to be done. Naturally, administrators won't bother you over random things, so if you post normal content on certain boards, you're likely to be as free as a bird indefinitely. Reddit jail doesn't even have impenetrable defenses, though, Even if you do get banned you could just pretty much change the IP address with a proxy, and you're ready to go. However, the only difference will be the fact that most things on the page will now load slowly, and porn that takes ages to load is something I'm not a fan of if that wasn't obvious by now.</p><p></p><p>No one like porn that takes ages to load, but no one likes advertisements as well, and those two tend to go together, but as you can clearly see, the content of /r/CelebNSFW Reddit loads very quickly, and there are little to no advertisements on the website, which is amazing, So, if you want your porn, you'll be nice, you won't be rude, you won't harass people on the website, and everything will be completely fine.</p><p></p><p>Next, I'd like to talk a bit about my first impressions of this section of Reddit, the things I've seen there, and whether these things mattered in the end or not. First off, the website is so kind to inform you about the number of people who have subscribed to a certain forum, or rather, a \"community,\" if you will. The celeb NSFW community has over 300 people subscribed, and the number of people posting actually increases day by day, which is amazing. I am stunned by the fact that people are so curious about how their favorite celebs look with no clothes on, Now, not only does the website tell you about all the people who are subscribed to this community, but it also tells you about the people who are viewing the board this very moment, which is also quite nice.</p><p></p><p>Now, you get to see the names of the moderators of the board, but this won't matter much to you, as you probably want to avoid any kind of interaction with those greasy dudes. I'm just making assumptions here, of course, I have no idea what these dudes look like, but I'm aware of what the average Reddit moderator looks like, and things aren't looking that good for them, sadly. The page also provides you with a few other things, such as a nifty rating system that lets you upvote certain posts, and it also lets you downvote them if you believe that that's what they truly deserve.</p><p></p><p>Then, you are also given the ability to see when a certain post was made, and you get to see the name of the person that posted a certain pictures, which is quite nice, however, clicking on the blue letters that are related to their account won't bring up anything too useful, so accounts here don't work in the same away accounts work on PornHub, for example. Clicking on a certain account will show you the pornos the person has uploaded and the playlists they have made, but since things like that don't exist on Reddit, a website that isn't primarily about pornography, it's quite pointless heading out to a certain person's account, so you better just leave them be and focus on the homepage for the most part, since there truly are no other things that deserve your attention on this website, especially this section.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Dissection of the celeb board</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Now, while certain pictures may be saved directly to your computer so you can view them, some of them can be saved to your Reddit account. You may also share certain pictures, and even though you have rated the pictures and told the world whether you like them or not, you can also leave a comment below and tell everyone just how much you love or hate a certain picture, which is quite nice, A feature I like very much, but yet again, a feature that many websites have.

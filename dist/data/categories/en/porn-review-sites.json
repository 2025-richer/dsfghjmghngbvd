As the world-famous MissAVDH, it’s no secret that I love watching videos of beautiful women getting stuffed all full of big, hard cock in every hole. Hell, some of you may have even seen me plying my trade over on MissAVDHCasting couch, where I bang real, live pornstars. Still, there’s something magical about X-rated anime that just can’t be captured in a live-action dirty movie.</p><p></p><p>That’s one of the main reasons I started HentaiSites.com, <strong>the world’s finest directory of the internet’s hottest hentai</strong>. It’s set up just like MissAVDH, only I’ve devoted every last pixel to anime-oriented adult material. Yes, weebs and weebettes, this is a platform designed specifically to help you find whatever deep-niche, kinky-ass hentai makes you the hardest and the drippiest. Why settle for whatever bullshit Google serves up when your ol’ pal MissAVDH knows exactly where to find the good shit? Let’s get into it.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>You Can’t Trust a Computer without a Boner</h3><p></p><p></p><p>The big computer brain housed at Google headquarters knows damn near everything about science and technology, music and the arts. Ask it for a cat meme about politics or a recipe for Boston cream pies and it’ll hook you up in seconds. It doesn’t seem to understand what gets a human being sexually aroused, though, probably because it doesn’t have a dingdong or a hoo-ha of its own. Ask it for the best free Latina porn and you’ll just get an unordered list of all the sites claiming to be the best—which just happens to be every single one of them.</p><p></p><p>MissAVDH started as me just cataloging my own thoughts and experiences as I fapped my way around the internet. Turns out, people had been looking for a helping hand and a legit human dick to help point them in the right direction. I started getting more and more traffic from horny, well-lubed web explorers, and the rest is internet history.</p><p></p><p>As confused as Google gets about live-action porn, imagine how baffled it is about hentai sites full of ahegao-faced office ladies, furry chicks with rabbit ears and huge tits, pregnant bimbos expanding to house-sized proportions, and gender-swapped Pokemon fisting each other up their distended pee holes. Hell, imagine even a simple request, like trying to search for the best hentai streaming tube or freaky VR anime spectacle.</p><p></p><p>I’ve reviewed a ton of hentai sites here at MissAVDH, offering up ranked lists of Hentai Porn Sites, Manhwa Hentai Sites, Porn Comics Sites and more. Those are usually adequate for the casual manga fan, the kind who typically crank off to real girls but appreciate a good doujin every now and then. If you’re a true connoisseur of the format, though, there’s a good chance you’ve got more specific tastes and would appreciate some more specific lists. Well, my horny friends, that’s where HentaiSites.com comes in.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Getting Déjà vu While You’re Really Horny</h3><p></p><p></p><p>The biggest difference between MissAVDH and HentaiSites is just the focus on girls with enormous eyes and funny hair. I’m going Super Saiyan in the header graphic, but yeah, that’s still me, and the site is set up just like the one you’re looking at. You’ll find rankings and reviews of the world’s greatest hentai sites, divvied up into even more relevant, perverted and manga-based subgenres than you’ll find here.</p><p></p><p>HentaiSites.com has lists of Hentai Streaming Sites, AI Porn Sites and Premium Hentai Sites just like MissAVDH. You’ll typically find at least a few more examples of each on HentaiSites, simply because I know you guys can appreciate it and are looking for it. You’ve got to keep in mind, I get millions of visitors a day at MissAVDH, so I do have to cater the experience to a more general audience. At HentaiSites, it’s all for the anime fans.</p><p></p><p>Some of my categories at HentaiSites are hentai-oriented variations of the stuff you’ll find here. Instead of MissAVDH’s broad list of Sex Doll Shops, you’ll find rankings of the best Anime Sex Doll Shops. Likewise with the Hentai VOD Sites, the Hentai Sex Shops, Live Cosplay Sex Cams, Hentai Forums and Hentai ASMR Sites. That focus should make it even easier to find exactly what you’re looking for without your balls exploding in frustration before you get there.</p><p></p><p>HentaiSites.com has dozens of hentai site categories to choose from. I’ve even got whole-ass lists of that extra-kinky shit that can be difficult to find on the more vanilla sites, like Futanari Hentai Sites and Furry Porn Sites. Even when I’m talking about joints with a fair amount of more traditional porno, my reviews at HentaiSites pay special attention to the quality and quantity of the anime smut on offer.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>The Latest and Greatest in Internet Hentai</h3><p></p><p></p><p>The main draw at HentaiSites.com is obvious: it’s the ranked lists of hentai sites broken up by category so you can skip right to your favorite types of content. Honestly, most of you ain’t going to be here for longer than a few seconds. I get it and I ain’t hurt. You’re horny as hell, and I’ve made the best examples of your preferred fap fodder available at a click.</p><p></p><p>If you do linger for a few minutes, you’ll probably notice another draw. Ever since I launched MissAVDH, copycats have been sprouting up all around the web, each claiming to have the best lists of the best porn out there. Most of these websites are cheap, shitty ripoffs, though a few do manage to list some decent masturbatory resources. You know what they’re all missing, though? Me.</p><p></p><p>What can I say, my friends? A big part of the appeal of MissAVDH has always been MissAVDH himself. <strong>I know what I’m talking about when it comes to jacking off, and I’m funny as hell</strong>. I’m actually even more knowledgeable on the subject than when I started a decade ago, having made a lot of industry contacts along the way. I’m also “studying” the stuff constantly, filling my brain and building an incredible amount of forearm stamina in the process.</p><p></p><p>All this is to say that HentaiSites.com remains the world’s top directory of its type, with quick and easy links to hentai sites in any category you might want to shake your dick at today. The search engines might know about these joints, sure, and you could theoretically find them if you’ve got some keywords and you’re willing to spend hours sifting through search results. Alternately, you could trust a true fan of the genre who knows what makes for a good hentai site. It seems like an easy choice, but don’t let me tell how to cure your blue balls.</p>"}},{"id":"e38bdd5f7fa3","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"e38bdd5f7fa3","title":"MyGaySites","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"MyGaySites.com is a website made by the genius behind MissAVDH.com.

My Gay Sites? Well, not everyone can appreciate a good, tight pussy or a pair of nice, perky tits. Insane, I know. But there is a growing minority of you fucks out there who just can’t seem to get enough dick. Some of you obsess over jacked dudes with huge dicks and shaved bods. I shudder just thinking out it. And I’m not talking about you hot slutty babes. I already know you bitches can’t get enough dick. I’m talking about other dudes. I personally could never give up my pussy slaying habits and start fucking other dudes, but I know my fucking porn.</p><p></p><p>I was getting bombarded by emails from you jackasses for years asking where the gay sites were on MissAVDH.com. I tried to hold strong and tell you all to fuck off and find it on your own. I mean, how was I, the alpha male elite himself, supposed to pick out quality gay porn anyway? But all of you persisted. Plus, I know a good fucking opportunity when I see it. I knew there were thousands, if not millions, of you horny dudes yearning for a resource like MissAVDH.com for all of your butt-fucking needs.</p><p></p><p>That’s why I gritted my teeth and went through the grueling process of watching hours upon hours of dudes fucking each other to create MyGaySites.com. Seriously, nothing confirms your sexuality like having to sit through hundreds of videos of dudes getting fucked in the ass and cummed on. While it didn’t grow on me, I managed to get enough “gems” on there to launch back in 2014.</p><p></p><p>And, I must say, the site has been doing pretty damn well since then. It may not be at MissAVDH levels of traffic yet, but it brings in a solid 2.5 million site views every month. Yeah, I know, I’m fucking awesome. Alright, alright, I’ll stop patting myself on the back and get to reviewing this site as if it weren’t my own masterpiece.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Skilfully Written Reviews for Both Premium and Free Gay Porn Sites</h3><p></p><p></p><p>As I’m sure you’ve gathered, this site isn’t full of hot porn of dudes taking it up the ass. And this site isn’t really a directory either. It doesn’t link out videos or any of that shit. It’s fairly unique as far as porn sites go. It’s solely dedicated to reviewing, ranking, and cataloging every gay porn site on the fucking internet. Don’t believe me? Check that shit out for yourself. They’ve got all the big names on there and are adding new in-depth reviews every single day.</p><p></p><p>And, as you could probably tell, this site doesn’t just give you shitty two-paragraph reviews that look like they were written by some fuck who was hit in the head about a dozen too many times. Hell, you’re reading what one of the reviews on that site would look like right now. Reviewception!</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Browse By a Wide Array of Different Kinks, Fetishes, and Ethnicities</h3><p></p><p></p><p>The homepage is where you’ll likely see sites you know or at least have heard of. We’re talking big-name sites that have earned their place. Each section lists out sites with the top one being the best and working down until you have a long-ass list of a bunch of different sites.</p><p></p><p>And, generally, there are two lists for each category: free or premium. The site breaks those apart so you don’t get cock teased by a site that you can’t afford. It also shows you big spenders out there know where to go right away for the best possible porn.</p><p></p><p>But if you want to browse the entire list, just click on the category header to get a full list of previews for every site we have in that section. There you can also see preview images for the site as a whole, as well as read a short blurb from the review. I highly recommend checking those sections out if you’re looking to find a gem of a site that you may not have heard of. There are usually dozens, if not over a hundred, sites and reviews for every category!</p><p></p><p>Each review page gives you a full-sized preview image of what the main page will look like, provides you with a link that will take you over to the site, a user rating, quick list of likes and dislikes, a list of similar sites, and you can scroll through the entire review off on the right side. And, yeah, I mentioned the reviews are in-depth, and I fucking meant it. Each review is upwards of 1,000-1,500 words, so you know you’re getting every pro and con of the site. No more clicking on crap ass sites without knowing what to expect. Always check MyGaySites.com first to avoid a shitty experience.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Awesome Mobile Experience!</h3><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>MissAVDH’s Favorite Features</h3><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>MissAVDH’s Suggestions</h3><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>MissAVDH’s Final Thoughts</h3><p></p>"}},{"id":"ea0bc4de6cc7","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"ea0bc4de6cc7","title":"Porn Webmasters","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"PornWebmasters.com has plenty of useful resources for those who want to build porn sites.

Well, you’re in luck, because it just so happens I know exactly the guy. Do you realize MissAVDH has been around for nearly a decade now and gets a couple of millions of visits a day? I may have started as just another masturbator like you, but I’ve since turned my hobby into a full-on career.</p><p></p><p>I pride myself on my unbiased reviews of all the best and worst adult sites the Internet has to offer, but I’m probably at least a little partial to this next one. I did make it, after all. PornWebmasters.com was unveiled to the public toward the end of 2024, and my traffic stats have been climbing steadily ever since. My goal was to build <strong>the best free resource for adult webmasters</strong>, a massive directory of tools, services, sites, and software to build your free lesbian tube, hentai library, or premium anal paysite. Whether you’ve been in the business for decades or you’re still just flirting with the idea of starting your own celebrity nude blog, this site is for you.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Allow Me to Toot My Own Horn for a Minute</h3><p></p><p></p><p>And just why would all these random perverts and wannabe porn webmasters be hitting me up, as opposed to the experts over at Brazzers, the neckbeards on Reddit or the weirdo who runs your favorite golden showers tube? Well, part of it is just the fact that I’m accessible, but <strong>I’ve also got experience reviewing thousands of porn sites in pretty much every legal category</strong>. I understand what’s going to make your amateur forum visitors leave forever, what’s going to draw wankers to your porn comics, and how to stand out among the thousands of free sex tubes already out there.</p><p></p><p>I ain’t just a casual observer, either. Any determined pervert with a ton of forearm stamina and an IV drip of Viagra can review gobs and gobs of smut, but I’ve also built multiple successful adult sites. MissAVDH is the big king daddy of them, but I’ve also branched out with other review sites like MyGaySites, BestPornGames and PornGeek. I even launched my own casting porn site recently, MissAVDHCasting, where you can watch me bang some world-class pornstars. I understand the business intimately because I’m balls-deep in it!</p><p></p><p></p><h3>What Makes PornWebmasters So Special?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>There’s also the matter of cost. There are so many smarty-pants motherfuckers out there on the Internet who tell you they’ve got some valuable information that can make you a ton of money; then they tease you with a couple of data points to convince you to buy their ebook or online master class. Half the time, they’re just selling outdated schemes to trick Google with a flood of keywords. It may have worked a decade ago, but the same strategies may well get you deranked or delisted altogether if you tried today.</p><p></p><p>Like MissAVDH, I keep PornWebmasters up to date with the latest tools and resources for online porn pushers. Also, like MissAVDH, the site is absolutely free to use, with no signup necessary and no spam. You’re not going to pay for outdated tools or other bullshit, because you’re not going to pay at all.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Who Said Anything About Bullshit?</h3><p></p><p></p><p><strong>I’ve structured PornWebmasters just like MissAVDH to make it easy as hell to find what you’re looking for</strong>. My resources are grouped into more than a hundred categories like Adult Ad Networks, Porn Tube Webmaster Programs, Adult WordPress Plugins and SEO Tools. Under each category, I’ve ranked the different services and tools by how effective and useful I think they’ll be for the average adult webmaster.</p><p></p><p>Now, those rankings will help you gauge the overall quality of the different Porn Webmasters resources, but online smut ain’t a one-size-fits-all kind of game. The dating affiliate sites that convert well on an amateur porn forum may not be the right fit for a premium fisting emporium, while the adult CDN used for a massive JAV tube is probably serious overkill if you’re just running an erotic stories library. That’s why <strong>I’ve written up long, in-depth reviews of the sites and services</strong>, much like I’ve done here at MissAVDH.</p><p></p><p>It’s one thing for somebody to point you in the right direction, but I’m doing more than that. My reviews dig deep into the features, the perks and drawbacks, and that all-important factor, the cost. That’ll give you an edge when choosing every element of your porn operation, from your web host to your popunder ad network, your backlink sources to your adult SEO services. There’s no reason to stumble around blind with your dicks out, friends.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Building Your Own Porn Site with Porn Webmasters</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Maybe you’re new to this, though, in which case you’re probably wondering where to start. Well, first, consider what type of adult site you’d like to run. I’ve listed a variety of scripts, plugins and WordPress themes that can help you put together a tube, webcam sex site, video aggregator or adult forum in a matter of days without any technical experience. Hell, I’ve even got adult link directory scripts if you’d like to make your own personal imitation of MissAVDH.</p><p></p><p>Once you’ve picked a name for your brand, you’ll need to register it and then find a good webhost. Naturally, I’ve got the most reliable, cost-effective porn-friendly registrars and hosts listed on Porn Webmasters. If you need content, I’ve got sources for porn available, too.</p><p></p><p>From there, it’s largely a matter of building traffic and figuring out how to best monetize your brand. Get those visitors coming with SEO tools, link building tools, guest posts on blogs and other techniques I’ve laid out. You can earn money from popunder ad networks, webcam affiliates, CPA networks, among others.</p><p></p><p>I’ve tried to include enough info with each category of webmaster tools that you’ll learn something, and know whether it’s a good fit for your porn empire, even if it’s your very first time. I’m also confident that even experienced webmasters can learn a thing or two just by reading the site. Are you picking up what I’m putting down?</p><p></p><p>Like the Internet itself, PornWebmasters.com is in a state of constant change. I’ll be continually updating it as I come across new tools and services that might be helpful to online pornographers, and weeding out the ones that are past their prime. No matter what kind of adult website you’re running, my goal is to provide you with everything you need to build a successful and fap-worthy porn empire. What are you waiting for? Get building, and then hit me up when you’re ready so I can check it out for MissAVDH!</p>"}},{"id":"c0555777d513","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"c0555777d513","title":"最佳成人游戏","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"BestPornGames.com is a website run by your old friend MissAVDH, which specializes in making reviews and rankings for a large number of high-quality adult games on various platforms.

In another life, before I was MissAVDH, I wasted countless hours of productive company time playing cartoon porn games and X-rated incremental clickers. These days, a bit of one-handed strategy or some adult dating sims are all in a day’s work. Hell, if I haven’t blown a load to a porn game today, it means I haven’t been doing my job!</p><p></p><p>Whether you’re getting paid for it or just whiling away the hours in your mom’s basement before your new waifu pillow arrives in the mail, it’s hard to beat the joy of an interactive adult experience. It is, in fact, one of the main reasons I started <strong>BestPornGames.com, a spinoff of MissAVDH where I rank and review the world’s best porn games</strong>. I’ve been building the site for a while now, but I haven’t mentioned it much around here because I’m such a modest motherfucker. Well, today seems like a good day for tooting my own horn. Speaking of, better pass the tissues this way because I’m about to pop a huge, creamy toot.</p><p></p><h3>The Best Porn Games in Your Favorite Categories</h3><p></p><p></p><p>My point is that “best” means different things to different perverts, so there’s really no one-size-fits-all approach to the question. That’s also why I’ve divided BestPornGames.com into dozens of sex game categories. There’s no sense getting all blue-balled flipping through a list of smutty RPGs when you’re just looking for a nice, casual slot machine with naked ladies to give you those Vegas thrills. That way, at least, you won’t lose your wallet or contract the chlamydia you caught last time you visited the real Sin City.</p><p></p><p>The real question is, what’s your idea of the best porn game? I’ve sorted and ranked my lists, so it’s easy to find something that floats your boat right away. I’ve got Action Adventure Porn Games, Porn MMO Games, Porn Clicker Games, Casino Porn Games, and Furry Porn Games. In addition, there are exhaustive lists of the best Visual Novel Porn Games, BDSM Games, Lesbian Porn Games, Strategy Porn Games, and Parody Porn Games. I’ve even got Gay Porn Games for the homos, VR Porn Games for the futuristic motherfuckers with space helmets, and a whole fucking ton of RPG Porn Games for those of you who’ve been banned from D&amp;D night at the local comic book shop.</p><p></p><h3>A Few Words from MissAVDH</h3><p></p><p></p><p>The setup’s pretty much the same over at BestPornGames; only I’m reviewing video games you can jerk off to instead of websites you can jerk off to. There’s actually a bit of overlap since so many of the games can be played on the web. With games like ComixHarem, the site is the game, and the game is the site. And that’s one of the reasons you’ll find some porn game reviews on this site, but the deeper archives are on Best Porn Games.</p><p></p><p>Just like it is here, one of the main reasons to find your BestPornGames on the site of the same name is that you can read fap-worthy video game reviews by yours truly. I’d be a fucking lame-o poser if I just made lists of games without trying them myself, so I spend time with every one of them before I decide where it falls on those rankings of Simulation Porn Games, Porn Puzzle Games, or Incest Porn Games. Of course, you’ll also get that trademark brand of hilarious, side-splitting, filthy, and rude humor that put your old pal MissAVDH on the map. (You’ll also find my crude comedy over at MissAVDHCasting, along with real videos of me banging some of the world’s most beautiful pornstars and amateurs!)</p><p></p><p>I mean, sure, you could spend hours fap-testing games like Big Bang Empire, Cunt Wars, and Angry Bangers, trying to decide which is the best one to play when you’re binging on Viagra and bong hits. Alternately, you could take a few minutes to check out my reviews to see which hit those notes you look for in a good sex video game. You can also scroll to the bottom and get the tl;dr version on my checklists of Likes and Hates from each game. I’ll tell you if they hammer you with in-game purchases, ads, and lousy titty art, or if it’s got an engrossing story, killer anime animation, and high-end ASMR audio.</p><p></p><h3>Play One-Handed on Any Platform</h3><p></p><p></p><p>My review digs into the gameplay, the artwork, and even the music, which is pretty damn high-end for a free porn game. As with any of the games I review, I give you a link to play it and tell you what systems it works with, in this case, Windows, Mac, Linux, and Android. <strong>&nbsp;I’ve listed the Best Porn Games on every platform, mobile or otherwise</strong>, so you can always have something interactive to masturbate with.</p><p></p><p>You know, if I had to list the worst thing about BestPornGames.com, I’d say it might be the potential spoilers. I try to avoid giving away too much, but it’s just the nature of reviews that I’m probably going to spell out some of the storylines and mention some of the game’s high points. The Mating Season has a lot of WTF moments, so those of you who appreciate surprises all the way through may want to skip the full review and just play the game. If that’s your play style, you’ll relish how I’ve got everything ranked; you don’t have to read every review to know which game I’d put at the top of every category.</p><p></p><p>Other than that, the worst thing about the site is how badly it’s going to fuck up your productivity if you’re a gamer and have boners on the regular. Before I started Best Porn Games, there really wasn’t anywhere on the web where you could find exhaustive, categorized adult game listings with ranks and reviews. Of course, there are some copycats out there now, but we all know who’s the original and still the best. Besides, what other porn video game site has such a charismatic, funny, and handsome mascot?</p><p></p><p>Just like MissAVDH, <strong>&nbsp;I’m constantly updating BestPornGames as I find new games to shake your dick at</strong>. In fact, somebody just sent me a link for a new Patreon Adult Game that I need to check out today. I know some people think it’s all fun and games being a full-time porn reviewer, and it is, but my fucking forearms are going to be tired as hell later. Well, don’t be surprised if yours are, too, at least if you love adult video games.</p>"}},{"id":"22367ed9b283","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"22367ed9b283","title":"PornDude AI","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"MissAVDH.ai is the first directory of AI online adult entertainment online Hundreds of AI porn sites rankings and reviews","canonical":"https://theporndude.com/zh/18045/porndudeai","affiliate_url":"https://porndudeai.com/","rating":5,"siteOrder":185,"price":"free","tags":[],"features":[],"categories":[{"id":"ai-porn-sites","collection":"categories_en"},{"id":"porn-review-sites","collection":"categories_en"}],"screenshot_url":"https://cdn.staticstack.net/assets/img/r-thumbs/94444_porndudeai_small.jpg","image_alt":"PornDude AI, AI porn site","scraped_at":"2025-10-28T19:09:17.555Z","iconSpritesheet":"custom-favicon-spritesheet.png","iconPosition":"-464px -832px","iconClassName":"ctm-icon18045","logoIconClass":"icon18045","pros":["rankings and reviews of the web’s best ai porn sites","14 ai-powered porn categories (so far)","over a hundred reviews at launch","new sites added all the time","hosted by your friendly neighborhood porndude"],"cons":["i’m sure the porndude imitators will make half-ass copies of this one, too"],"detailedDescription":"<p>You don’t have to be a world-renown smut scholar like your old pal MissAVDH to have noticed the effect AI has had over the whole online porn scene. Even if you haven’t been burning all your daylight hours generating your own custom nudes, you’ve definitely seen those realistic fakes popping up in your tubes. It’s been a blast watching the technology evolve by the day, and I feel like there’s a new AI porn sub-niche popping up every few months. The developments do present a small challenge for the professional masturbator and cataloger of the web’s naughtiest sites: do I keep adding new sections to MissAVDH.com, or has AI-powered porno become big enough to warrant its own directory of rankings and reviews?</p><p></p><p>Well, MissAVDH.ai is my answer. I’m still adding new AI reviews to my main site and new categories whenever necessary, but this new one takes a tight focus on adult sites that use Artificial Intelligence to help keep those boners throbbing. It’s basically MissAVDH.com but focused on AI, similar to what I’ve done with porn anime at HentaiSites.com and sex games at BestPornGames.com. <strong>This one categorizes, ranks, and reviews all the best adult AI sites on the web</strong>. It’s another little spinoff I’m proud of, so let me tell you fine folks all about it.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>From a Wet Dream to the Porno of the Future</h3><p></p><p></p><p>A few years before AI photo undressers really exploded onto the internet, we got our first taste of deepfake nudes. They were lightyears ahead of the old cut-and-paste mashups, instantly angering celebrities and giving internet perverts a whole new niche of content to shake their dicks at. I reviewed a couple of the early “automatic” deepnude makers aimed at regular joes, but the results were never near the quality you’d find posted on Reddit. The power to make your own was still limited to the tech wizards, like your weird, smelly cousin who only comes out of his basement lair for a few minutes whenever your aunt has Christmas dinner at her place.</p><p></p><p>And then came the AI image generators. A lot of you probably played with the clean ones first, and if you’re anything like me, you tried to get them to do dirty stuff. They all had the same kinds of filters in place to prevent exactly what we were all trying to do. Weird-ass AI-generated cat memes and fake celebrity spaghetti-eating photos were everywhere, and we all had the same question: where the hell are the AI nudes we’ve long been dreaming about?</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Phase One of the AI Porn Revolution</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Soon, the simple prompt-based interfaces began evolving into picture menus of keywords. Instead of typing your request for a big-boobed blonde on the beach with wet hair and tattoos, you could just check off the boxes. Other platforms began rolling in artistic AI models, letting users create masturbatory fuel that looked like oil paintings, fantasy airbrush portraits, and Pixar-style 3D in addition to the usual realistic and hentai styles.</p><p></p><p>It wasn’t just the mechanics of these AI sex machines that were improving, but the quality of their output as well. Remember how fucked-up everyone’s hands looked when AI first started showing its faces online? The digits, the lovely mugs, the boobies and everything else got more and more realistic, with lower chances of churning out unspeakable abominations of malformed human flesh with each pull of the lever.</p><p></p><p>I’m launching MissAVDH.ai with all my rankings and reviewed divided into 14 AI-oriented porn categories. I expect that number to grow, just as it has here at MissAVDH. My original list of AI Porn Sites consisted of only image generators at first, but it wasn’t long before those webmasters, masturbatory magicians and total tech geeks applied that same AI voodoo to another niche we’d all been dreaming about.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Enter the Instant Deepfake Makers</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Again, I watched the interfaces and the output quality of the whole AI undress niche improve by the week. It was like watching a robot grow up in a science fiction movie, only that robot was designed primarily to help you jack off. Soon, AI porn sites were combining features from other platforms and promising new ones, including instant AI porn videos and virtual models of anybody, real or otherwise.</p><p></p><p>Credit card processors haven’t decided how exactly they’re going to treat AI porn sites just yet, and it’s been interesting to watch them feel it out. Honestly, it’s one of the reasons a site like MissAVDH.ai is necessary: a lot of the larger, more full-featured AI platforms have been dropping features, replacing them, or launching new sites for some of their offerings, all in response to changing rules from the payment companies. The categories on MissAVDH AI can help you find exactly what you’re looking for, despite the constant shuffling. I am hopeful this confusion will end as AI porn matures, though.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>What’s Coming Next in AI Pornography?</h3><p></p><p></p><p><strong>I’m launching MissAVDH AI with over a hundred AI sites reviewed across the various categories</strong>. That includes AI porn image generators, AI hentai machines, AI deepfake collections and AI deepfake makers, as well as everything else I’ve mentioned in this little writeup. Just like I do over at MissAVDH, <strong>I’ll be adding new sites to the lists as they pop up around the web</strong>. It’s hard work that requires constant hardness, but I’m always up to the challenge. I just hope the girls who visit me at MissAVDHCasting don’t get too jealous.</p><p></p><p>MissAVDH.ai is the first directory of online AI adult entertainment, but I know it won’t be the last. Why? Because MissAVDH.com is one of the most imitated porn sites on the internet, and I just expect it to happen again. I know they’ll never hold a candle to this one, though. There are a bunch of reasons people prefer my reviews over the next guy’s, including the facts that I know my shit and I’m funny as hell. <strong>MissAVDH AI is hosted by yours truly, and when have I ever done you wrong</strong>?</p><p></p><p>Millions of people visit MissAVDH.com every day to find exactly what they’re in the mood to jack off to right now. You can find AI porn galore among my usual reviews of free tubes, paysites, sex blogs and more right here, but MissAVDH.ai lets the connoisseurs of these burgeoning niches explore a futuristic wonderland of tech-fueled fap fodder. If you’re wondering just how many ways these horny robot brains can make you happy, here’s a place to do it without too many real women getting in the way.</p>"}}]

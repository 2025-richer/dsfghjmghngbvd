Rule 34 animated porn, aka R34 XXX, aka Rule 34 website! Since the dawn of the interwebs (or at least since wifi was a thing), there has been a rule. A rule, or perhaps a constant, which has inspired variation, intrigue, and general weirdness – rule 34 (r34). According to Urban Dictionary, this rule is defined as…</p><p></p><p>“If it exists, there is porn of it. If there isn't, there will be. Only one known exception: rule 34 itself.”</p><p></p><p>I call it, the constant which dictates that there are enough weird, horny fuckers who can draw pretty well and will find a site to upload their pervy posts for equally odd and horny people to whack it to.</p><p></p><p>No one knows where rule 34 came from or what dark corners of the net the first rule 34-esque posts came from, but it's certainly an iron law of pursuing porn on the web. If you can imagine a porn parody of something, it already exists. And if it doesn't, the good folks at rule34.xxx (and certainly user RWBY) have a made it their mission statement to make sure that it does.</p><h3>Does This Site Really Have Porn Parodies of Everything?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Besides the bevy of babes with gravity-defying tits, you’ve got your animated horses screwing, humanoid dragons cumming on each other, 18+ schoolgirls with gigantic gozongas making sexy poses, and unclassifiable creatures doing stuff.</p><p></p><p>Besides typical sex stuff, there's a lot of fetishes represented here – and way beyond what you might suspect. Between the occasional scat or trampling posts, you'll eventually find some pregnant men posing suggestively or a sexualized dinosaur laying an egg.</p><p></p><p>There’s even a pic of a cartoon chive standing on a stack of books and talking dirty while penetrating a submissive white rook. Yes, that’s right, you read that correctly. An onion fucking a goddamn chess piece.</p><p></p><p>To be fair, the effort of the artists put into each post is generally pretty good. Plus, everything is extensively well tagged, so finding other kinky shit related to the stuff you are swinging it to isn't too hard. (Yeah, of course, there's no pun there.)</p><p></p><p>That’s the amount of content and level of variety that rule 34 has generated and which the Rule34XXX website has dutifully collected. Sadly, everything is still images, no videos at all.</p><p></p><p>But, unlike other porn sites which feature a lot of hentai and hentai-inspired content, virtually everything on Rule34 is completely uncensored. No obnoxious black bars or stupid pixelation. And unlike other sites in this genre, everything is posted in English. Best of all, all content is free.</p><p></p><p>So, if you’re into inventive cartoon fetish stuff which can tickle your fancy and never fail to provide variety, this is the site for you.</p><p></p><p>Oh yeah, in case you were wondering, there are plenty of pretty attractive “normal” looking girls doing sexy poses, if you’re into that stuff, too.</p><h3>Adjusting to the Sites Aesthetics</h3><p></p><p></p><p>At worst, it looks like a digital throwback from ages ago. Seriously, despite being created in 2012, you know when database web builders like Wordpress and Wix had long been mainstream, Rule34 looks like it was coded in 1998.</p><p></p><p>There are no drop-down menus, each page is crawling with awkwardly placed ads, and the text-heavy pages are terribly formatted. Weirdly, even the search bar is only accessible from the home page and nowhere else.</p><p></p><p>To get around this, the site's designers added a \"cheat sheet\" page just to make certain forms of navigation and posting on the site easier.</p><p></p><p>To be fair, though, the site actually looks a little bit better on mobile, weirdly.</p><p></p><p>Assuming you can make it past the design crap factor, there are a low of neat sub-sections on Rule34. First, the page called pools collect all of the posts with a common theme or are best viewed in a certain sequence, like a series of comic strips.</p><p></p><p>The stats page lists the most recent top-ranked users, including commenters, image posters, forum posters, and more. By checking out the aliases and artists' page, it's easier to find your favorite site contributors. You can even check the most recent comments on popular posts on the comments page.</p><p></p><p>Technically you can search for other tags on this page but only tags. Same deal with the artists and aliases pages, too.</p><h3>Devoted and Intense Community</h3><p></p><p></p><p>However, there is a lot, and I mean a lot, of community engagement. With over 15,000 members, hundreds of people online at any time in the day, and hundreds of forum posts, there’s plenty of people to chat with about your favorite smut sketches.</p><p></p><p>You can access 90% of the site without an account, but by registering an account, you can take part in all of the forum discussions and Discord chatting. Fortunately, account registration is really easy and completely free.</p><p></p><p>To get more community engagement and to, apparently promote good artists, Rule34 does have something I’ve never seen on any other porn site – an iCame count. Users are asked to report which pic that they most recently squirted over. Top posts are ranked with an interesting iCame counter. So if you're looking for novelty and a unique sort of top favorite page, there ya go.</p><p></p><p>If you find that you can't get enough of the type of porn posts on Rule34, there are several other partner sites in the Booru community. On the plus side, a lot of the content style is the same. Most posts are cartoons, although there are some sweet pictures, cleverly photoshopped images, and even some clever gifs. Oh yeah, there is a subpar blog website, if you care about that kind of thing as well.</p><p></p><p>On the downside, the same shitty web design is used throughout the Booru sites. On top of that, the level of quality control varies between each of the other Booru sites. You’ll also have to deal with a bunch of distracting ads, too.</p><p></p><p>Moving on, if you really want to support the community, Rule34’s got a Patreon page and even a small e-store where you can buy a Rule34 shirt if you want to flash your affinity for animated kink in public.</p><h3>So What’s My Final Word?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>So yeah, Rule34.xxx definitely lives up to its name.</p><p></p><p>Still, I can’t get over how bad the web layout is. Like I said, if you can get past how bad it is or even manage to adjust, I guess it won’t totally ruin your experience. That is, of course, if you can get used to it. On the other hand, the active community and sheer amount of content does make up for this a little bit.</p><p></p><p>Despite its design issues, it’s got lots of good (and super weird) content and a good community which is why I give Rule34 three out of five cramping hands.</p>"}},{"id":"cc9158dc9801","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"cc9158dc9801","title":"Kemono Party","lang":"en","date":"2025-09-22T00:00:00.000Z","description":"Kemono.Party is a free adult anime content scraping website.

E Hentai (ge hentai) is one of the largest and most popular hentai and doujin sites on the web. E-Hentai (gehentai) is an imageboard type hentai site where content is uploaded by users in all kinds of languages and art styles.</p><p></p><p>The first thing to know about E Hentai (ge-hentai) is that it is huge. The collection is so big that you might get intimidated when you first see the site, just like how a virgin might get scared of a big ass dick. But don't worry, I'll let you know how to make the most of the E-Hentai system.</p><p></p><p>E-Hentai doesn't quite work like most other hentai sites. You won't find broad categories such as yaoi to choose from, but rather everything is driven by the search engine. Luckily, there are plenty of tags and descriptions on all the works so you can go nuts with the search terms.</p><p></p><p>If you don't know what you're looking for and just want to browse a bunch of porn, things can get a little more tricky.</p><p></p><p>E-Hentai has a Most Popular gallery on the main page, but there's a fatal flaw. You see, E-Hentai supports just about every language in the goddamn universe, so you’ll run into a lot of different languages, including ones you can’t read.</p><p></p><p>So if you read English, always make sure to search \"English\" as part of your keywords. As I said, a shitload of content means you'll have to get clever at digging.</p><p></p><p>Just how much porno are we talking about? Let’s just say the content will reach the half-million mark soon. If you jacked off to everything on E-Hentai, your dick would look like beef jerky by the end.</p><p></p><p>E-Hentai, just like its sister site <a href=\"https://MissAVDH.com/3283/exhentai\" target=\"_blank\">ExHentai</a>, can be a tough place to find porn just because it's so damn big and tries to serve so many different things. Reminds me of a restaurant with so many goddamn menu items that you don't know where the fuck to begin.</p><p></p><p>So let's dig deeper and see what E-Hentai has to offer us. I can tell you that the juice is worth the squeeze.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>The Big Brain Search Engine</h3><p></p><p></p><p>E-Hentai is all about efficiency over style. You won't find any fancy web design here, but rather everything revolves around getting you the best porn as fast as possible.</p><p></p><p>Before we search, you should scroll down and browse the main gallery. You'll see a gallery of thumbnails for popular works, although they aren't organized particularly well and can be in all sorts of languages.</p><p></p><p>That's a major issue I had with this site. I was constantly clicking on shit that I can't read. It’s actually annoying to scan through the title trying to find the language, and sometimes the titles are too long to even show what language it is. E-Hentai just doesn’t make it easy.</p><p></p><p>You'll find information such as upload date, uploader, and rating. All the goods here are provided by other users, so don't be surprised if you see some really fucked up shit. Do you know what kind of people this type of place attracts?</p><p></p><p>In fact, a lot of the hentai here has a big warning page that says something like \"this shit is completely fucked up. Go at your own risk.\" Of course, that's the exact type of shit that can make me want to pull my dick out and jerk off like a retard.</p><p></p><p>I also have to tell you that the ratings are great. The motherfuckers that read E-Hentai are super serious about their porn, and there are enough readers that the ratings actually mean something. Unlike most other porn sites, you'll actually want to pay attention to the ratings here.</p><p></p><p>Anyway, let's go back up to the main search bar. This is the center of your universe at E-Hentai. You'll see a bunch of bars that help you pick what category you want to search.</p><p></p><p>The categories include doujinshi, manga, game CG, Asian, and a few more. Most of the shit you find will be hentai and <a href=\"https://MissAVDH.com/hentai-manga-sites\" target=\"_blank\">hentai manga</a>, but you’ll be surprised at how much Western porn is on the site also.</p><p></p><p>In the search bar, you can search things including languages, parody, characters, porn types, and more. E-Hentai uses a big tag system that captures all kinds of shit.</p><p></p><p>There are various filters you can use at E-Hentai that you won't find in other places. First, E-Hentai has a lot of torrent files. If you like using BitTorrent, or want to search big files, you can search by torrent galleries only.</p><p></p><p>Another key feature is setting a minimum rating. With tens of thousands of hentai to go though, you're going to want to get just the creme de a creme. The comics rated 2 or below are usually ass anyway, unless you have some seriously fucked up eyes.</p><p></p><p>I also want to point out the lo-fi layout. if you go to the bottom of the page, you should see a small link for the Lo-Fi Version at the right.</p><p></p><p>This makes a site a big list of the hentai, thumbnail included. It uses up much less data, but it's also a great way to browse the hentai. If the main site starts giving you a heads, try this layout. Like they say, keep it simple stupid!</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Lots of features on E-Hentai</h3><p></p><p></p><p>You'll need to register to use these features. Registration also lets you rate the hentai, write comments, and post on the forum. Pretty standard stuff.</p><p></p><p>Speaking of which, E-Hentai has a huge and active forum. There are mostly discussions on how to improve the site, but you’ll also find general life shit also. Surprisingly, not much porn sharing going on at the forums. It’s more like a social outlet for these degenerates.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>What I Like</h3><p></p><p></p><p>The site also has awesome western comics and porn. Usually, porn sites are only good at either hentai or western porn, so having a site that’s great at both saves me a lot of effort.</p><p></p><p>I also give kudos to the tag system. The tags almost always point out details like what the bitches are wearing, what skin color they are, and what deviant acts they are going through. You also get a full list of parodies.</p><p></p><p>Also, the torrent section is godlike. There are surprising amounts of seeds for a lot of this porn, making it surprisingly useful. If you use torrents, check it out.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>What I Hate</h3><p></p><p></p><p>The content is really random. Not just in terms of genres, but even shit like languages, art quality, art style, etc. It’s not a great place to browse.</p><p></p><p>I already talked about how annoying it is that they have doujin in like 54 different languages. This pretty much forces you to use the search engine in my opinion.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>E-gads that’s a lot of E-Hentai!</h3><p></p><p></p><p>The Rule 34 is also strangely limited. Maybe I just didn't search correctly, but even popular franchises like One Piece didn't have much doujin. Not sure why, since all the hentai is from users and Rule 34 is some ridiculously popular porno.</p><p></p><p>E-Hentai also has a bit of an identity crisis. There's a lot of random real porn here that just doesn't fit in. You'll also find a lot of non-porn content also, which just makes me scratch my head. We have shit like DeviantArt for that, don't we?</p><p></p><p>Still, I'm sure some of you super nerds out there will look down on me for this review. I can tell E-Hentai is really flexible with a great system, it's just a matter of knowing how to use it best. E-Hentai (often misspelled as \"ge hentai\", \"g-e hentai\", \"g-hentai\", \"e hentai galleries\", \"ghentai\", \"g-ehentai\" and \"e hentia\") is also a fantastic source for torrents, which sadly seem to go down in popularity every year.</p><p></p><p>If you want to find Spanish or Portuguese hentai, definitely check it out. But for English and Japanese users, I think there are better sites out there. I also recommend E-Hentai if you're looking for some real specific shit, but I didn't find it as great as <a href=\"https://MissAVDH.com/1709/nhentai\" target=\"_blank\">nHentai</a> for casual browsing.</p>"}},{"id":"cd08dd99dda5","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"cd08dd99dda5","title":"E621","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"E621.netE 621 is a Danbooru type picture forum website.

Man, there’s a lot of degeneracy in porn. Things like pregnant porn, amputee porn, fatty porn…people are fucking strange. Well, fucking strange is one thing, but then there are furries. Furries have a special place in my heart because it’s the only major fetish where you move away from humans. And what’s really amazing is how fucking popular this shit is…amongst humans!</p><p></p><p>I blame Disney, brainwashing youngsters with walking and talking animals making fuckfaces from a young age. Those sick fucks knew what they were doing when they made Beauty and the “Beast”. Anyway…</p><p></p><p>When it comes to E 621, we have a popular Danbooru-style imageboard dedicated to furries. Danbooru imageboards all follow a similar template that makes it easy for users to upload their own content, while allowing people to search images using keywords. Danbooru is the name of the original famous website that used this template.</p><p></p><p>The good thing about these types of boards is that once you learn to use one, you can check out a bunch of other Danbooru-style porn sites and navigate them easily. This template has become super popular over the years, still existing since its origination in the mid-2000s.</p><p></p><p>Going a little bit into the history, this site replaced a similar board called Sidechan in 2007. It was apparently attacked many times over the years from hackers. e621.net also has a sister site called e926, which is basically e621 without the porn (why even?), so I guess you can go there for the community and more “artistic” part of furry faggotry.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>A solid Danbooru site</h3><p></p><p></p><p>There’s also a really small menu with links for login, posts, comments, tags, the Wiki, and the forum.</p><p></p><p>Once you do a search, you’ll get the usual layout with the gallery on the right and the search/keywords on the left. For e621, the trending tags are shown in this toolbar so you can happily jackoff alongside other furries worldwide.</p><p></p><p>There’s a lot to explore on this site that I don’t have time to get into. The Wiki will give you key articles on how the website functions and how you can become a good contributor. There’s always little technical shit you need to know when using these sites.</p><p></p><p>The board also has a huge community, and there is a chatroom as well as a forum to get to know your fellow furry freaks. I don’t have a login so I didn’t check out the chat, but I’m sure it is very wholesome and not degenerate at all.</p><p></p><p>One thing to note is that the site features various furry artists on their own posting board. You get an easy to navigate list of the name of the artist, along with all the posts that have the artists’ photos. This is super convenient to check out a bunch of the artist’s work immediately, and it looked like the artists have dutiful fans who are constantly uploading their shit.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>There’s a lot of furries in this world</h3><p></p><p></p><p>The site also has these things called “pools”, which gather all the related pics of a theme into one gallery. This is great for comics and exploring an artist’s work. It’s super annoying when you search and find one really interesting page of a comic, and then you have to go dig for the rest.</p><p></p><p>Pools make it so much easier to find that type of linked or related content. The best thing about pools is that it has a search function, so you can find pools of the weird particular shit you’re looking for and go to town. I found this more fun than just browsing generally.</p><p></p><p>One final note is that there is a lot of SFW content. That means there’s a lot of non-porn content, which I think is fucking dumb cause they have a sister website dedicated to that shit. But either way, just keep in mind that you’ll run into a lot of animals wearing clothing as well. There’s also a lot of cool and high skill art cause of this, but seriously, aren’t we just here to jack off?</p><p></p><p></p><h3>What I Like</h3><p></p><p></p><p>The amount of content itself is sure to be unrivaled on the internet for furrydom. The site also has a ton of animations, which believe me are really entertaining and surprisingly high quality.</p><p></p><p>The best one I saw is this 3D animation of this roided out horse with a two-foot cock intimidating another roided out horse handcuffed to a chair. You spent two years in a community college digital art class to make THIS shit!?</p><p></p><p></p><h3>What I Hate</h3><p></p><p></p><p>I also didn’t find any real videos, and I believe the platform doesn’t allow for it outside of things like webms and gifs. This is standard for image boards, but for me porn just isn’t porn without video. We have the technology for it, let’s use it!</p><p></p><p>I can’t hate on the board for how they placed ads, but just be warned that there are ads sprinkled around. Also, all the ads are for weird furry shit, and are hilariously shitty.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>How do you say “more categories” in Wolfspeak?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>The problem with this is that it’s hard to browse and discover new content. If you’re searching by keywords…well…you only know the keywords you know. If you’re searching by trending tags, that shit doesn’t tell you anything about whether it’s good or not. All you know is that its popular at that moment, which doesn’t mean much.</p><p></p><p>I also think the site should try to find a way to do away with ads. Don’t communities like this support each other like crazy with donations? I’ve seen furry porn artists make fucking doctor salaries from Patreon! Less ads are always better.</p><p></p><p>The funny thing about my suggestions is that e621 and Danbooru users will probably scoff at them. And honestly, I would agree with them. This is the type of site where the users get off on their “exclusivity” and culture, similar to 4chan. I acknowledge all that. But I’m here to review a site, so fuck it.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>It’s all Disney’s fault</h3><p></p><p></p><p>It may also do you some good to learn about Danbooru boards. These image boards are the best when it comes to speed and finding the content you want. There are lots of porn sites based on this template, and it’s one of the best I’ve seen for non-video content and community.</p>"}},{"id":"2ebd5353f131","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"2ebd5353f131","title":"FurAffinity","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"FurAffinity.net is one of the largest and most popular websites in the world and has the most active orc-control enthusiast community.

So today I’m bringing you a review on a goddamn hentai site. For you fuckers living under a rock, hentai is basically Japanese cartoon porn. Imagine jerking off to bitches from Pokemon, except with potential for some unbelievably sick shit, and you get the general idea.</p><p></p><p>Gelbooru.com is referred to as an “imageboard”, although to me it just looks like a big ass search engine for hentai. Gelbooru is pretty fucking famous, and the reason why is because it uses a tag system so you can easily find the sick twisted pics you’re looking for. With over four million pictures of girls and boys ranging from fuckable 18+ anime hotties to saggy-ass-titties old, not to mention all kinds of weird creatures and fetishes, you’ll probably find what you’re looking for. More on the tag system later.</p><p></p><p>Gelbooru’s been around since 2007, and its legion of weeb users continues to grow every day. You’d think with their tiny ass peckers, they’d grow tired of jerking off, but apparently, them zipperheads are just as horny as I am. The site was built off the source code of another famous website that’s since died out, and Gelbooru is now the world leader of hentai bitches.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>It’s good, but fucking ads make me sick</h3><p></p><p></p><p>So let’s say you type in “taint”, like I did. Right away, you’ll see a bunch of pics of cartoon bitches’ taints, just like the uploaders had tagged their pictures. That’s right- for every picture you see on Gelbooru, the degenerate loser uploading it made sure to point out that a “taint” was in the goddamn picture. Isn’t that goddamn convenient?</p><p></p><p>On the left, you’ll see a shitload of “tags”. These are popular tags that were used in other photos. I’m looking at shit like 2girlls…arm support…”blue kimono”? These Gelbooru freaks make me sick. Anyway, you can enjoy browsing around these random tags if you’re bored or feel the need to get inspired for your session.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Who the fuck draws all this shit?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Now let’s talk about the tag system on Gelbooru. Look, I know it’s a good system. I can just fucking tell it’s good based on playing around with it and seeing how popular this site is. But if you aren’t used to it, it can be a huge pain in the ass. Let me explain why.</p><p></p><p>First, the tag system is all about specifically finding what you want. That means that <strong>Gelbooru rejects vague ass terms that it considers too basic or too generic</strong>. For example, if you search “bitch”, you get to an error site. You search “cunt”, you get an error. You search “slut”; you get an error. As a man who appreciates the basics, this made me pissed off.</p><p></p><p>But like I said, I get it. Once I successfully jerked off and let my brain start working again, I realized that this is why Gelbooru became popular. It really encourages the uploaders to make good tags, and the system stops retards from clogging up the search with stupid content. You have to get used to using underscores a lot. That’s ___ &lt;- this shit, in your tags. Like you can’t search “Tifa Lockhart”, but you have to use “Tifa_Lockhart”. It can get confusing.</p><p></p><p>Whatever, if you are a loser who likes jerking off to cartoons all day, I’m sure you have zero life and can learn and master this system. Arigato to you incels.</p><p></p><p>There’s also some other weird things which I’ll quickly go over. First, apparently, <strong>you need to be a member to do some more complicated tag searches</strong>. It’s free to join, though. Second, they have this weird Wiki that is just random as hell. Again, this is some weeb inside-joke community shit that these Gelbooru nerds love to jerk off to even more than pictures of cartoon girls getting fucked by a cartoon starfish. The site also features “pools”, which are groups of really specific picture-types. For example: “Blacked girls - Anime girls who love black cocks”. Finally, it has a link to a Doujin sister site, which is basically hentai comics.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>What I Like</h3><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>What I Hate</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Now, when I tried to repeat this to see how it triggers, it didn’t happen, so I’m not sure what the exact code is. Anyway, I just feel like <strong>Gelbooru is kind of shady and sneaky with its ads</strong>, so I’m warning you now so you don’t get too pissed off as I did.</p><p></p><p>Also, like I said before, the tag system at Gelbooru.com needs some getting used to. When you use tags incorrectly, you get sent to a bizarre error page talking about some chickens or some shit, and then some message telling you to “check your blacklist”. I didn’t know what the FUCK this shit was talking about, so I ended up having to Google it to figure out what was going on. I still don’t know exactly what the FUCK this is, and no, I ain’t gonna learn. It just wasn’t intuitive.</p><p></p><p>BUT AGAIN, I get that they have a reason for this shit. Weebs are degenerate sick fucks, but they are smart.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Fucking fix that shit!</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Also, cool down on the ads.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Have fun, and don’t forget to commit seppuku after for being such incels who can’t even jerk it to a real girl.</p>"}},{"id":"fb1e5b7515a7","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"fb1e5b7515a7","title":"Rule 34 Paheal","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"Rule34.Paheal.net If you like cartoon pornographic content, then you will most likely like Rule34 Paheal.

I know what you're thinking? What the fuck is this Rule34 Paheal shit? Well, <a href=\"https://MissAVDH.com/342/rule34\" target=\"_blank\">Rule 34</a> (animated) is a popular meme that essentially states, ‘if it exists, there is porn of it.’ In other words, it’s the idea that, since the world is filled with weird and perverse people such as yourself, there is porn of every single thing imaginable. Or, as rule34.paheal.net puts it in their About section, “There IS porn of it, no exceptions.”</p><p></p><p>Intricate drawings of Pokemon fucking their masters? There’s porn of it. Weird manga of fairies having every orifice filled with monstrous tentacles? There’s porn of it. Videos of grannies drinking shit and cum cocktails? Well, you get the picture (unfortunately, in that case).</p><p></p><p>If you are ever in doubt of the bold creative spirit of humanity, just look at the porn industry. It’s amazing the lengths people will go to get off. There is even a porno in the process of being made that will be shot in space. That’s right, antigravity fucking in a rocket ship. The two porn stars cast for it have been training for years for the role of a lifetime.</p><p></p><p>We put a man on the moon, and, now, we will put a man in a woman near the moon and film it. There’s nothing that we can’t do when we’re horny. Imagine if we applied this level of motivation and creativity to use in other fields. If only fucking could somehow solve problems like global warming and war. We would live in a beautiful utopia. I guarantee it.</p><p></p><p>Well, if we are going to have to deal with massive floods, superstorms, and potentially the extinction of our species, at least we will have an endless supply of porn to enjoy in the meantime — nothing like fapping away the woes of the world. If we can’t solve the world’s problems, at least we can make ourselves feel good while we still have the chance!</p><p></p><p></p><h3>32 Rules on Rule 34</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Rule 34 also does not allow anything that would be considered “toddlerkon,” meaning drawn images, 3d renderings, or anything depicting girls who appear to be underage. They really do not fuck around when it comes to this kind of thing. Thankfully.</p><p></p><p>You are also not allowed to post images or videos of anything that depicts animals “in an explicit manner.” The rule goes on to say, however, that anything drawn is acceptable.</p><p></p><p>Lastly, Rule 34 has a policy meant to limit the amount of ‘soft’ porn that appears on the site. They write in the Rules section of the website: “If there are under 60 images of ‘real’ porn of a character, then ‘soft’ porn is allowed until there is enough ‘real’ porn. By ‘soft,’ we mean ecchi, topless men, lots of cleavages, sex juices, fetish wear, bulges, camel toe, bare ass, and generally less explicit erotica. Otherwise, penetration of orifices or visible genitals, anuses, or female nipples is required.”</p><p></p><p>There 32 rules in total to abide by as a user of Rule 34, which seems like an awful lot to keep track of, especially when it comes to their precise requirements on what kinds of content you can post and how you are expected to post it. Honestly, even if I was into animated porn, this might be too many things to keep track of.</p><p></p><p>Of course, I agree with the zero-tolerance policy against CP and beastiality, but there are about 30 other things to keep in mind that are much less important as well. So, you might want to keep this in mind before you decide to join this online community. Some people, though, I know, are into this level of organization and moderation when it comes to their online forums. Either way, I just thought this would be the first thing to know before deciding on using this site.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Not Your Typical Porn Site</h3><p></p><p></p><p>You will likely have to familiarize yourself with the site and the community a little bit. Though, before this truly becomes beneficial—you’ll need to become acquainted with the tags that exist (especially since one of the rules is that you cannot create your own tags that no other image has). I’m not sure how they introduce new material to the site then, knowing this.</p><p></p><p>The moment you arrive at Rule 34’s home page, you will notice that it is not anything like most porn sites. The first thing you will see is a green page with just a small amount of text in the upper left-hand corner. The text reads, “For legal reasons, we have to point out that: A) This site contains material not suitable for minors […] B) Cookies may be used. Click here if you’re an adult, and you’re ok with that.”</p><p></p><p>Even after entering the website, it won’t be immediately recognizable as a porn site. You’ll be brought to a page that contains only a search bar, some browsing options, and seven anime catgirls, each holding a sign with a number on it.</p><p></p><p>At first, I thought they might just be random numbers, but then it occurred to me that it’s probably the number of posts the site contains: 2 – 4 – 8 – 2 – 0 – 6 – 3. Two million, four hundred and eighty-two thousand, sixty-three fucking posts. That is a shit-ton of porn. This site has the potential to be a real haven for animated porn lovers.</p><p></p><p>Above the search bar, you will also find “Rule 34” written out in a straightforward blue font. Under the logo, you can choose between “Posts,” “Comments,” “Tags,” “Wiki,” and “Documentation.” I started with tags first, just because I was still unsure of how the site worked precisely. Doing so brought me to an enormous list of tags with an alpha-numeric list above it. Even just the “A” section had me scrolling on forever. Tags are also sized by popularity, so that the tag links which contain a higher number of posts are larger. It's a great feature that I kind of wish other sites would adopt. It just makes browsing porn a little bit easier.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>High-Resolution Images, but Lacking Community Features</h3><p></p><p></p><p>I settled on an excellent drawing of Eric (Arielle’s love interest in the tale) eating Arielle’s ass. She is on her stomach and raising her beautiful, plump ass to Eric’s face, which is buried within it; her face is one of seductive passion, bedroom eyes, and all. Again, I’m not into toon porn, but I could see someone who was, being really into this drawing.</p><p></p><p>The images all appear in extremely high resolution and are, frequently, rather large by default, allowing you to fully enjoy the detail in them (you can also change the size of the image if you wish). Under the image, you will find the uploader, a list of relevant tags, a URL of the image’s source, and user comments. Anyone can comment, it turns out, with or without a username. It is always great to see a site (especially one that is mainly focused on user-uploads) embrace the potential of community features.</p><p></p><p>That being said, I think Rule 34, just like <a href=\"https://MissAVDH.com/2677/rule34hentai\" target=\"_blank\">Rule34Hentai</a>, could embrace such features a little more. Although users technically have “profiles” affiliated with their handles, there is not much in the way of personalization or communication. I would have liked to see a feature that allows you to curate your personal galleries at the very least. Or an ability to chat with fellow users. But no such luck. Actually, come to think of it, Rule 34 does not even provide you the ability to rate images.</p><p></p><p>If you love animated porn, hentai, manga, 3d renderings, or anything non-human, Rule 34 has fucking tons of it. Their tag system should make finding it simple, and it is all high-resolution, high-quality stuff. They are missing some prominent community features, though, and I’m not crazy about the site design (plus, ads). But just because it’s not for me doesn’t mean that you won’t enjoy it. Check it out for yourself.</p>"}},{"id":"18aae8140e0d","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"18aae8140e0d","title":"Sankaku Channel","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"Chan.SankakuComplex.com I like adult anime You like adult anime We all like adult anime and Sankaku Channel is your new home You can find wonderful sexy slutty adult anime pictures here...","canonical":"https://theporndude.com/zh/3999/sankakuchannel","affiliate_url":"https://chan.sankakucomplex.com/","rating":4,"siteOrder":8,"price":"free","tags":[],"features":["动漫"],"categories":[{"id":"hentai-porn-sites","collection":"categories_en"}],"screenshot_url":"https://cdn.staticstack.net/assets/img/r-thumbs/9547e95-sankakuchannel_small.png","image_alt":"Sankaku Channel, adult anime porn site","scraped_at":"2025-10-28T19:38:21.959Z","iconSpritesheet":"custom-favicon-spritesheet.png","iconPosition":"-432px -384px","iconClassName":"ctm-icon3999","logoIconClass":"icon3999","pros":["millions of sexy hentai pictures and videos","wide variety of extreme fetish categories","plenty of search options","it’s completely free!"],"cons":["nothing"],"detailedDescription":"<p>Ready for Sankaku Chan? I’ll go right ahead and say it. Hentai is the best shit there is. Pictures, gifs, animations, and everything in between. Nothing gets my dick harder than watching my favorite anime slut getting railed. Give me all the tentacle, monster, BDSM, lesbian, ecchi, and all that kinky fetish content. I can’t get enough of it. You get crazy content that regular porn simply cannot achieve. Riley Reid? Get back to me when I can see her get milked and fucked by a dozen tentacles and maybe I’ll hear you out. And, if you’ve stumbled across this review, then you probably lust after big breasted hentai whores just as much as I do.</p><p></p><p>And there are a slew of great sites to get your hentai fix. But, for this one, I’ll be focusing on gifs, pictures, and short-form videos/animations. You can check out my dozens of other hot hentai site reviews for somewhere with full-length videos, because this site won’t have all that. Today I want to tell you all about Chan.sankakucomplex.com. A domain that really rolls right off the tongue.</p><p></p><p>Chan.sankakucomplex.com is a beast of a site. It’s a chan type site, but it looks and works a bit differently than you might expect. Instead of multiple boards and places to post and discuss topics, you get a massive imageboard with tags that you can browse by. It’s more like Imgur than it is like 4chan. And when I said a beast of a site, I fucking meant it. They bring in upwards of 35 million horny weebs to the site every single month. That makes them one of the biggest hentai imageboard sites on the fucking web.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Straightforward Site Design and Very Sleek Beta Site Worth Checking Out</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Now, that site version is sleek as fuck. I love it. Nice dark theme, bigger image previews, and tucked away menus. All in all an awesome site, even for a beta. I hope they end up sticking with it. But, since that shit isn’t official yet, I’ll stick to the main version of the site for the rest of the review to avoid confusion.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Loads of Different Options for Browsing Sexy Hentai Pictures and Videos</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Notes give you a feed of images with English translations for the speech bubbles of certain images. Fuck yeah. That shit already takes this shit to the next level. Like when you’re over at some bitches apartment and she sticks one of those tail plugs up her ass before letting you fuck her doggy style. It’s those little things that matter. Rankings are pretty simple. It lets you sort by most popular or highest quality artists, characters, or copyrights.</p><p></p><p>Everything else up there is pretty straightforward except for “Pools.” Pools are user-created folders that have certain themes. Like “fellatio videos” or “League of Legends Vore.” Shit like that. And other users can contribute content to those folders if they have something to add. And I’m sure you fucks do. I know you’ve got that extra terabyte drive set aside for all of your favorite hentai.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Each Tag Will Have Hundreds if Not Thousands of Results</h3><p></p><p></p><p>You can plug in simple terms like “bukkake” or toss in the name of your favorite waifu to get a fuck load of results. The advanced option gives you even more options like image size, megapixels, rating, and options to exclude certain tags you don’t like. What blew my fucking mind was how many results you get. Each tag has a number of photos/videos that are in that section. BDSM, for example, has over 140 thousand results. Damn.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Finally, A Site That Doesn’t Shy Away From Extreme Content!</h3><p></p><p></p><p>For each image, you get a small preview that doesn’t really tell you much at all. I mean, I can’t blame them since they have millions of pictures and videos on the fucking site. Though hovering your cursor will tell you everything you need. File type, author, poster, etc. All that good shit.</p><p></p><p>And you won’t be disappointed by the quality of content. The images are fucking massive, and you get art from nearly every popular hentai artist out there. You can save pictures or videos without issues as well. No bullshit memberships that stop you from housing this good shit in your spank bank. And I mentioned videos. They aren’t your full-on hentai episodes. It’s more of a WebM style deal going on here. Short videos up to a few minutes long that are usually fan animations, sometimes even with audio, of sexy bitches like Ochaco Uraraka riding some dick.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Definitely Use the Beta Site for Mobile</h3><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>MissAVDH’s Favorite Features</h3><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>MissAVDH’s Suggestions</h3><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>MissAVDH’s Final Thoughts</h3><p></p>"}},{"id":"ff885f26e901","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"ff885f26e901","title":"ExHentai","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"Exhentai.orgEx Hentai is a great fantasy Japanese comic adult anime website which has some of the weirdest cartoon porn content you can find on the internet here are thousands of pages of porn comics to enjoy and all of them are classified...","canonical":"https://theporndude.com/zh/3283/exhentai","affiliate_url":"https://exhentai.org/","rating":5,"siteOrder":9,"price":"free","tags":[],"features":["动漫"],"categories":[{"id":"hentai-porn-sites","collection":"categories_en"}],"screenshot_url":"https://cdn.staticstack.net/assets/img/r-thumbs/2e4b0_small.jpg","image_alt":"ExHentai, adult anime porn site","scraped_at":"2025-10-28T19:38:27.239Z","iconSpritesheet":"default","logoIconClass":"icon0","pros":["free manga panels and hentai","loads of content","almost instant updates","categories","simple layout"],"cons":["no videos","no adult forum","hard to figure out how people get off hentai"],"detailedDescription":"<p>Ex Hentai...I thought this site was dead first, when I saw that sad panda image. Anyways, to those of you motherfuckers that enjoy jerking off to manga, hentai, and doujinshi. Have you heard of Exhentai.org? Well, this is where your fucked up hentai dreams come into reality. This site is full of delicious hentai doujins that are more than ripe for your fapping business. Here you are going to find some pretty extreme fetishes including scat to name something.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Access</h3><p></p><p></p><p>If you follow this simple <a href=\"https://MissAVDH.com/blog/how-do-i-access-exhentai-org-sad-panda/\" target=\"_blank\">tutorial</a>, you should be okay. Of course, there is a possibility you might still be blocked by the sad panda in which case there is little I can do to help. It’s potentially possible that Exhentai.org itself blocks you from browsing it because they haven’t acquired the copyright agreements to show their site in your country. But if you have access, then welcome to the sickest hentai site on the internet. Don’t even thank me; this is what I fucking do best. Remember Ex Hentai is the subsidiary of the more easily accessible <a href=\"https://MissAVDH.com/338/e-hentai\" target=\"_blank\">e-hentai.org</a> but has by far more x-rated content that the parent site couldn’t display for fear of falling out with their benefactors.</p><p></p><p>The site is basically a place for doujins- the unofficial erotic Japanese comics anime series or movies. This is a suitable destination for masturbating on anime magical girls.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Statistics</h3><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Site design and navigation</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Navigation is not bad either. There are 25008 pages in total but luckily, pagination is not limited, and you can jump from one corner of the site to the other without breaking a sweat. The top menu allows you access to the categories, galleries, settings, and an advanced search feature that will definitely prove useful. There is also no single intrusive ad in sight, which is even better. Overall, you will find your experience smooth which is the most important thing.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>An endless sea of content</h3><p></p><p></p><p>There are currently 25,009 pages at Exhentai.org each with loads of panels and plenty of sexual action. They might be more by the time you get to read this review. To give you a hint, I clicked on one called kanojo no yiitsu (loosely translated to hot dogging and ass cheeks fuck) which features an exciting story of a guy and his girlfriend and of course punctuated by loads of raw, hardcore fucking. It has 20 pages all of which can be downloaded instantly at a click of a button. The stories are pretty complex and will certainly make for good reading and definitely jerking off, which is what twisted perverts like you do when something is even remotely sexual.</p><p></p><p>As is to be expected of this genre, the artistry is on another level as is the eroticism which will leave you clutching on to your thick meat giant. While many of the doujins are available in Japanese, there are English translations which will naturally come in handy. Enjoy these toon babes as they display some cartoon cunts in a bizarre fashion that does the whole <a href=\"https://MissAVDH.com/hentai-manga-sites\" target=\"_blank\">hentai manga</a> niche loads of justice. These artists must have some pretty dirty minds to even think of putting out these kinds of drawings, but genuinely, those who fap to cartoon porn will find a virtual porno haven right here.</p><p></p><p>Usually, images are resampled to 1280 pixels of horizontal resolution for online viewing. This provides for some good viewing. That said, the settings link at the top navigation allows you to make some adjustments regarding the way you view images. For instance, you can manually restrict the maximum display of an image, although the site automatically scales down the images to fit your screen width. Still, it’s not a bad option to have.</p><p></p><p>Still, under settings, you can choose which display you would like to use on the front page. Additionally, you can choose which categories to exclude by default from the front page or searches. Not too many sites give you such options. You can also choose and rename your favorite categories. Remember with the account; you can add doujins to a list of favorites and also leave your comment.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Artistic style</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Speaking of new content, there are fresh mangas almost after every two minutes which explains the massive amount of material in here. It seems like artists are trying to outdo each other, and the eroticism gets better and kinkier.

Danbooru (Touhou project) is a hentai and anime image board site that allows users to upload porn for the world to enjoy. The site features a deep tag system that lets you search by things such as character, artist, fetish, and a whole lot more.</p><p></p><p>While famous for its porn, Danbooru has plenty of SFW content as well. Danbooru has evolved into an anime art site just as much as a porn site, but don’t worry, there is still more fap material than you can handle here.</p><p></p><p>Unlike other Booru sites, Danbooru only allows anime-style content. While you may find CGI, JAV, and other types of porn on similar sites such as Gelbooru, Danbooru keeps it 100% 2D anime bitches for you to get off to.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, you’ll still find plenty of Rule 34 here, as long as its anime related. All the major franchises including Pokémon, Fate/Stay Night, and Final Fantasy offers plenty of your favorite females to fap to. Meanwhile, you won’t find things like Marvel, Family Guy, etc.</p><p>One thing to remember about Danbooru is that it has a tiered membership system. If you are a lurker, you’ll only get to search two tags at a time, and not much else. Free registration gets you more content like editing tags, doing ratings, and more.</p><p></p><p>But meanwhile, there are also Gold and Platinum memberships (one-time fees) that unlock how the site is meant to be used.</p><p></p><p>I don’t know if Danbooru was always like this, but I get a big feeling that this place is very commercialized, and tries hard to run like a business. This means that Danbooru has great features including a newbie tutorial, big and active staff, and constant updates.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Is this heaven? Cause there’s a ton of porn and everything’s white</h3><p></p><p></p><p>One thing you’ll note when you first arrive is that the gallery includes lots of SFW pictures. Indeed, there are top tags like “puffy sleeves”, “hat”, and “vest” that should tell you that this place is as much about art as it is about porn.</p><p></p><p>Well fuck that art shit, we are here to fap. So get some porno terms in that Search box on the left and click enter to get 100% porn on your screen ASAP.</p><p></p><p>Whenever you do a search, you’ll also get some recommended tags to try on the left. Danbooru also shows you how many images are connected to each tag, so you know what’s popular.</p><p></p><p>One awesome feature of Danbooru is that they explain each tag. On the left of each tag you’ll see a \"?\" sign. Click on that to get a quick definition, which is useful for those Japanese terms that you might not be sure of, like futanari.</p><p></p><p>In general, Danbooru has a ton of these little things that make it newbie-friendly. There’s a business-like focus to the site that becomes more and more obvious as you browse. Like instead of there just being a comment box, there’s a huge goddamn link to the “How to comment” Wiki so clueless idiots can learn how to comment.</p><p></p><p>Anyway, click on a thumbnail in the gallery to go to the main viewing page. If the post has related pictures such as a parent or sibling, you’ll be told at the top with links. You’ll also get information like copyrights, character, artist, and tags.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Pretty strict guidelines</h3><p></p><p></p><p>First, the pics need to be reasonable quality. You won’t find any doodles or MS Paint porn here. This is probably Danbooru’s best feature, since we all know how ugly amateur hentai can get.</p><p></p><p>Everything is also anime style. There is no Marvel comics, Family Guy, or even webtoon art styles here. If the bitch doesn’t have freakishly huge Angel Alita eyes, it won’t be accepted.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, there is plentiful Rule 34. I don’t know how copyright legal shit works, but Danbooru at least has the decency to allow all kinds of anime Rule 34 to be uploaded. The top franchises featured at Danbooru include Pokémon, Fire Emblem, Fate, and Touhou.</p><p></p><p>As long as it’s anime and drawn reasonably well, you will find it here.</p><p></p><p>As for tags, the top popular porn tags include large breasts, cameltoe, ass visible through thighs, and other creative shit. I don’t recommend browsing Danbooru by tags though, since you’ll be sifting through a shitload of SFW bullshit. I didn’t find any easy way to filter out the SFW pictures either.</p><p></p><p>If you haven’t used Booru sites before, make sure to read the Search Cheat Sheet under the Wiki. Images can be searched by things like age, favorites, rating, source, and all kinds of other “meta” strings.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>What I Like</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Personally, I don’t like this kind of concept. I like my porn sites rough and dirty, as long as they don’t have malware or bullshit ads. What kind of tiny pricked incels actually want to get their hands held when navigating a website?</p><p></p><p>But still, the little details on Danbooru set it apart from the rest. The pictures are very carefully curated, making every porn picture professional quality, or at least really damn good. I can fap to most of the NSFW shit they got at Danbooru.</p><p></p><p>The tags are also top-notch. Like any good Booru site, Danbooru makes sure to pack plenty of tags to each pic to make the searches accurate. There are even meta tags that identify pictures that are ultra-high quality, or Patreon supported, and other random things.</p><p></p><p>The Rule 34 collection is fucking huge. Over 100,000 pictures for Fate, and over 600,000 (!?) pictures for Touhou, like is this shit for real? Who has time to draw all this!? Now, I admit most of these aren’t porn, but the bottom line is that people really love their anime franchises here.</p><p></p><p>Even though Danbooru has a paid membership system, the good part is that it doesn’t have any ads. You won’t find any popups, popunders, banner ads, or anything resembling an ad here. This is obviously super rare for any porn site, and impressive for a site of Danbooru’s size.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>What I Hate</h3><p></p><p></p><p>I think Danbooru might be a little overly restrictive to non-members. Only being able to search two tags is really restrictive, and arguably destroys the whole point of going to a Booru site in the first place.</p><p></p><p>Finally, Danbooru has way too much SFW art. I’m sitting here trying to fap, and yet Danbooru keeps throwing all this…clothes at me. You’ll need to throw in tags like “nude” or “nipples” to avoid the bullshit results.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>An Internet legend</h3><p></p><p></p><p>There are millions of high-quality images, with a huge chunk of them being fap-worthy, and has all the anime Rule 34 you can ask for.</p><p></p><p>Although Danbooru (often misspelled as \"danboru\", \"danborru\", \"dabooru\", \"danburoo\", \"danbarou\" and \"danbouro\") is pure anime focused, considering how much content there is I think it’s better they keep it that way. Adding Simpsons, Marvel, and other Western-style porn to the site would make it insanely complicated and unfocused.</p><p></p><p>As I said, there are newer Booru sites that are more focused on porn and fapping. Danbooru tries hard to promote itself as an “art” website, with higher standards for artistic quality and overall more strict vetting process.</p><p></p><p>You won’t get the full experience unless you pay a little cash, but for most of you, the free content will be enough to get your fap on. Just learn a little bit about how the search engine works, and you’ll get the highest quality anime porn of all kinds to enjoy.</p>"}},{"id":"e05ff50205d2","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"e05ff50205d2","title":"Luscious Hentai","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"Luscious.net is a popular porn site.

It doesn’t matter whether you’re up for some good old-fashioned lesbian strap-on sex, or if you’d prefer seeing a skinny, wimpy anime protagonist fuck his way through all of his female classmates and teachers in just a few episodes. Luscious.net has both real and imaginary porn covered, and I must say it’s one of the most impressive sites that delve into both categories, because usually when a XXX domain tries to deliver both real and drawn content, they excel at one but suck balls at the other. Not here though – this is one of the few XXX websites which can hit both ends of the porno spectrum right so you can be sure that you’ll get the best of both worlds when treating yourself to a fap on this domain.</p><p></p><h3>They Take Image Porn Seriously</h3><p></p><p></p><p>There’s a shitload of nicely-drawn image content on Luscious (often misspelled as \"lucious\" and \"lushious\") which I have to say is pretty impressive – this site takes their image content seriously by offering thousands of single images, whole image-sets, GIFs and mangas to choose from, and they’re separated by a wide variety of categories including but not limited to cosplay, hentai, hardcore, softcore and so on. There’s nothing more wholesome and old-school than jerking it to a still image of a sexy slut, and it’s honestly a dying form of porn-consumption so you ought to pay respects to the very industry that keeps you happy by pulling up one of the many image-sets featured on this site and jerking away.</p><p></p><h3>If Mangas Are Your Thing, Then You’ve Found Your Haven</h3><p></p><p></p><p>There are over 14 different manga categories to choose from, including wholesome categories like 3D hentai, lesbian, superhero, video games, interracial, Western (traditional cartoons), and standard hentai. Then there are the more fucked up categories suitable for those who have burned out their porn-viewing receptors from watching 'normal porn' and need something with a little extra kick. These include furry, cross-dressing, taboo, monster girl, futanari (dick girls) and the cult classic, ‘My Little Pony’. And of course, there’s also a gay category if you like wieners on top of wieners.</p><p></p><h3>The Video Section Is Absolutely Bonkers</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Then there’s the ‘Categories’ section, which allows you to sift through 12 different themes depending on what you want- there’s a weird variation here which ranges from ‘Superhero’, ‘Hentai Series’ and ‘Futanari’ to ‘Trans’, ‘Fakecest’, ‘Ethic Girls’, ‘BDSM’ and so on. There’s also the ever-trustworthy ‘Tag’ section, where you can pick through countless tags depending on what kind of sex, models, fetishes, and themes you want to see in your video (e.g. Blowjob + White Girl + Casting + Interracial). There are also a few other search modifiers which filter through both real porn videos and hentai/cartoon content, these can be 'translation' (depending whether you want your hentai to be dubbed, subbed or with no subs), character (if you have a certain fictional character in mind), duration of video and even preferred artist if you’re looking for a specific content creator in mind for cartoon/3D videos.</p><p></p><h3>The Blog is Popping</h3><p></p><p></p><p>There are hundreds of different active threads with dozens being added on a daily basis, and there are users who are active every hour so you can be sure that you’ll get a chance to socialize with real people even if you’re the loneliest porn addict in the world. You can talk about literally anything you want on here and you’ll probably get plenty of responses in no time regardless if you’re chatting about your favorite hentai or running a thread about role-playing furry porn.</p><p></p><h3>The ’Sex Games’ Section Is Actually Just One Game</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Now I’m a porn expert, not a game expert, and while the gameplay in this turn-based CCG, PVP browser game looks boring as fuck I have to give the devs props for their art. This game sees you playing as a protagonist who leads an army of beautifully-drawn sluts that please you after completing every level or winning a PVP game, and the art does a solid job at arousing you. I’d imagine this game is super hot for nerdy types who love boring card games like ‘Hearthstone’ and ‘TES: Legends’ as well as have an affinity for nicely-drawn hentai.</p>"}},{"id":"8899e2c14dc1","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"8899e2c14dc1","title":"Hentai Foundry","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"HentaiFoundry.com is an online adult art community.

One of my favorites! Puberty is such a weird time. All of a sudden, you’re flooded with hormones telling you to fuck everything you see. A minute ago, you were just trying to watch cartoons, and now you can’t even see an animated pair of breasts without wanting to whack off. It’s no wonder, so many of you pervs grew up still wanting to look at drawings of superheroines while getting your porn fix. If you’re into comics and cartoons cunts, Hentai-Foundry.com, aka hentai foundary, may be the online community you’ve been looking for.</p><p></p><p>The site’s been a respected smut-stop among hentai enthusiasts since its inception in 2006. Since then, it has steadily built its user-contributed collection of art into what has to be one of the Internet’s biggest archives of cartoon coitus.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>What the Fuck is Hentai?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Hentai traditionally refers to a pornographic subgenre of Japanese anime and manga. Anime and manga sound fancy if you’ve been in living in a box for a few decades, but they’re just cartoons and comics that happen to be from the Land of the Rising Sun.</p><p></p><p>Hentai Foundry doesn’t really split hairs. While you’ll find plenty of art in the traditional Japanese hentai style, it’s not the focus of the site. Every form of art is on display here. The element that ties it all together is the sex.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Vampires Sluts, Devil Whores, and Warrior Nymphos</h3><p></p><p></p><p>What they lack in layout sparkle is more than made up for with the quality of the art. I’ll be honest, I’m much more into flesh-and-blood pornstars than paintings of elf bitches, but even I was impressed. It isn’t the work of a bunch of wannabes. HentaiFoundry is professional-level stuff.</p><p></p><p>The top row of images on the front page is the Featured Pictures. Currently, I see an illustration of a witch masturbating with her broomstick, and another of some warrior chick flashing her ass at the artist. There’s a digital painting of a sad devil chick, exposing her supple red breasts in what we have to assume is an effort to ease her despair.</p><p></p><p>A couple of the Featured Pics made me do a double-take. These were really polished digital paintings of big-busted sluts getting railed by slippery wet, glistening, veiny cocks. As I said, the cartoon stuff generally doesn’t do much for me, but I definitely had some movement in my pants when I saw those.</p><p></p><p>Below the Featured section is a couple of rows of Recent Pictures. The quality isn’t quite as high as what you’ll find in the Featured Pics, but it’s all many steps above the weiners and butts you doodled in the back of your algebra book. These trickle in live, so you’ll get a steady stream of new cartoon T&amp;A if you linger on the site.</p><p></p><p>Things step up again in the Popular Pictures area. The art is top-shelf, but what I found interesting was the content. While the Featured Pics had some dirty stuff, this is where it gets really nasty. Even I had to save a few of these pics for later enjoyment.</p><p></p><p>So, what’s popular on Hentai-Foundry? A babe with massive knockers made the cut, held in the air and fucked from behind by a monster. Another shows a slut locked in the stocks, getting finger-cuffed by a pair of furries. There’s a chick with enormous melons and horns, covered in cum and taking on a sword-sized monster cock. My favorite, though, is the whore being fucked by some kind of goddamn tentacle monster.</p><p></p><p>The final part of the main page is a few items of Site News, which isn’t updated very often. I’m reviewing Hentai-Foundry at the beginning of November, and the most recent newsflash is from June. Before that, it was April. These updates are mostly contest announcements, but one is to let users know about their Discord channel.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Stuff for the Readers, Too</h3><p></p><p></p><p>The stuff fits the overall theme of the site, minus the illustrations. You’ll find erotica here about Video Game Vixens, sexy high school teachers, and warrior princesses. Like elsewhere on the site, a ton of it is inspired by comics, games, and movies. I see Harry Potter smut and dirty Overwatch stories.</p><p></p><p>I didn’t delve too deeply into it because, frankly, reading porn stories takes a lot of time. Hentai-Foundry has an extensive library, with some stories surpassing novel length. If you like beating off to words, you’ll be busy for a while.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Look at These Fucking Categories</h3><p></p><p></p><p>The Categories page is broken down into Anime &amp; Manga, Cartoons, Games, Misc, and Original. The first few feature sexualized versions of your favorite Japanese comics, cartoons, and video games. Western comics are filed under Misc, along with TV shows and movies like Lord of the Rings.</p><p></p><p>I highly recommend looking up whatever your favorite cartoon was growing up. The picture of Harley Quinn, hands bound behind her back and face in Catwoman’s ass, just may make me a believer in this hentai stuff.</p><p></p><p>If you’re looking for the kinkiest shit Hentai-Foundry has to offer, look no further than the Original category. Here you’ll run into subcategories like those Tentacles I mentioned. There’s also shit like Anal, Taboo, and Scat. Furries will be happy to see their interests represented, as will fans of Futanari, also known as Dickgirls.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Contests and Curated Content</h3><p></p><p></p><p>I think those contests I mentioned are part of the equation. You’ve already got all the best dirty artists from around the world contributing their smut to the site. Offer them an incentive for the sexist art, and you’re sure to end up with a fucking goldmine of the stuff.</p><p></p><p>The prizes aren’t chump change either. It looks like they’ve usually got a grand or two in cash and prizes ready for the winners. I almost wish I could draw out my fantasies to share with the world. Then again, if I could do that, I’d probably wither away and die in a masturbatory frenzy.</p><p></p><p>Material on Hentai-Foundry also has to make it past an Approval Panel. They ensure you’re not going to run into some half-ass bar bathroom graffiti tits. No wonder the standards are so fucking high.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Don’t Forget the Forums</h3><p></p><p></p><p>There is some spam in the forums, but it’s not entirely overrun like some discussion boards on the ‘net. If you want to roleplay Mass Effect sex scenes or get feedback on your nude portrait of Supergirl, this is the place.</p><p></p><p>Given their extensive catalog of curated, high-quality art, and the fact that you can view it at no cost, it’s no surprise that Hentai-Foundry gets nearly 15 million visitors a month. Cartoon smut may not be for everyone, but this site is a free goldmine, just like <a href=\"https://MissAVDH.com/338/e-hentai\" target=\"_blank\">Ehentai</a>, if that’s what you’re into. The catalog is varied and interesting enough that it’s worth a look even if you don’t think a cartoon could ever make you hard. You might surprise yourself.</p>"}},{"id":"f258dcc8ec9e","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"f258dcc8ec9e","title":"Sankaku Complex","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"SankakuComplex.comSankaku Complex can provide you with all the news about animation comic games and Japan, and pornographic content.

They’re getting more than 30 million views a month right now. Today, MissAVDH is one of them.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Anime, Manga, Games, Japan</h3><p></p><p></p><p>This place gets more action than your favorite crack whore.

I’ll have to click through to one of the full posts to read any of them.</p><p></p><p>I’m going to warn you right now, not all the posts are sex-related. I see headlines like Far Cry New Dawn Colorful In More Ways Than One, and Sumo “Autograph” Signing Intrigues the Internet. There’s also stuff like Top 10 Truths About Sloppy Women You Didn’t Want to Know. One thumbnail is curiously blurred out, so I know where I’m heading first.</p><p></p><p>SankakuComplex scales a little bit with your screen width. It looks perfectly fine on mobile. The only extra element on the wider window of a laptop is a simple header. Even without the header, you can get to all the same places on the site via the drop-down menu in the upper left corner.</p><p></p><p>The header and dropdown have quick links to the Forum, as well as the Login and Register areas. There’s a search bar, and access to SankakuComplex’s four main categories: Anime, Manga, Games, and Japan.</p><p></p><p>Yeah, I know what you’re thinking. You don’t read MissAVDH so you’ll know what anime game is coming out next for PS4. No, you’re here because I point you to all the best hardcore pornography the Internet has to offer. Let’s find those naked bitches on Sankaku Complex.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Where the Hentai Bitches At?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>“You are proceeding to a page containing mature content,” SankakuComplex tells me. “Is this OK?”</p><p></p><p>Is this OK? You’re goddamn right, it’s OK! Show me the tits and the cunts and the puckered assholes, now!</p><p></p><p>After agreeing to have my mind and soul eternally corrupted by mature content, SankakuComplex delivered me to the post. It’s a pretty detailed write-up about a new sex toy based on an anime character’s bootyhole.</p><p></p><p>In typical blog style, the fake butthole just happens to be sold by a site they’re partnered with. Whatever. It honestly looks like a decent synthetic anus. The only thing that really separates it from other premium silicone rectums is the anime girl on the box.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Listen to These Pervs</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Before you dismiss the commentary as basement-dwelling bullshit, keep in mind that purchasing a simulated turd cutter is a big decision. You want one that’s going to feel amazing on your dick and hold up to a lot of fucking. Before you make a major investment like that, it’s a good idea to hear from a community well versed in anime-enhanced masturbation.</p><p></p><p>These fuckers get passionate. Check out the comments under Boku no Hero Academia Live-Action Hollywood XXX Due. The post is about some anime adaptation that may or may not contain non-consensual sex. The comment section goes on for pages and pages about whitewashing, Hollywood’s lack of originality, and who best to direct.</p><p></p><p>There’s also a pretty spirited discussion about some pics of a hot chick dressed up as Bowsette. She’s a fan-invented female version of Bowser from Super Mario Brothers, which really pisses some people off. These knuckleheads are threatening to cut each other’s dicks off over this shit. Personally, I can’t get too angry about a gorgeous young woman in a silly outfit with nice cleavage.</p><p></p><p>I checked out the SankakuComplex forum, which is not nearly as active as the comment sections. It’s probably because you can post anonymously on the blog posts, but not on the forum. Whatever the reason, the forum only gets a couple of dozen posts a day. It’s as good as dead on a site as big as this one.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Show Me More Titties</h3><p></p><p></p><p>If you’re already familiar with the kind of stuff SankakuComplex posts, I’m sure it’s easy to find what you want to see. Just type it in the search bar and off you go. If you’re a newbie, like me, you’re kind of on your own. I can’t even find a big list of tags anywhere.</p><p></p><p>Of course, you will find stuff just wandering around. This fake butthole post, for example, has a bunch of links to other fake butthole posts at the bottom.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>This Is What You’re Into?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Right now, I see a post about 18+ schoolgirl photography in some video game. Sure enough, they’ve filled the page with pics of anime teens in swimsuits and surprisingly skimpy school uniforms. Jesus, I was a walking boner in school even without outfits like that.</p><p></p><p>Check out Tensei Shitara Slime Datta Ken Slimes Elf Girls. The whole post is full of screengrabs and animated GIFs that look like your typical fantasy anime. There are warriors, wolves, swords, and bad looking dudes. Suddenly, four elf chicks are surrounding a wad of slime, rubbing their enormous boobies on it.</p><p></p><p>There’s also a post about whores in Las Vegas complaining about sex dolls. Apparently, they steal jobs and also encourage extreme sex. I don’t know about encouraging extreme porn, but I can understand the job-thieving part. I would totally smash the sex doll they used in the pic for the story. I actually thought it was one of the quoted sluts at first.</p><p></p><p>I guess the big question is this: who is Sankaku Complex, Sankaku Channel or Sankaku Chan (chan.sankakucomplex.com) for? Porn fans just looking for something to casually beat their meat to will probably just want to go hit a regular porn site. Even if you’re into hentai or sex video games, there are better places for a quick wank.</p><p></p><p>SankakuComplex is a good blog for people who like sex, but are also fans of video games, manga, anime, and Japanese culture in general. Let’s be real for a second: most gamers and comic book nerds are fans of porno and tits, too. SankakuComplex isn’t afraid to admit that. They’ve rolled adult material into the mix and it feels entirely natural, because these things really do go together. Come get your fix.</p>"}},{"id":"953ae8154fe3","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"953ae8154fe3","title":"Rule34Hentai","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"Rule34hentai.net As long as it involves image content, there is no better website than Rule34 Hentai.

Whether it’s Fate, Frozen, or the Simpsons, you’ll find all your favorite 2D babes fucking and sucking in its huge gallery.</p><p></p><p>The main feature of Rule34 Hentai is the search engine, which is one of the best engines I’ve ever used once I got used to it. Rule34Hentai uses a variety of tags on all its content that makes it easy to find that specific nasty shit you want to see your characters doing.</p><p></p><p>When you type in a term and press Enter, you’ll see that instead of the search going through you just end up confirming the tag.</p><p></p><p>Rule34Hentai.net encourages you to use multiple tags in your search, confident that it can dig up whatever you want to throw at it.</p><p></p><p>Another awesome feature is the Refine Search table. Anytime you search something and get tons of results, Rule34Hentai recommends you a set of tags to pair with what you searched. The algorithm they use for this is fantastic, as you’ll get the most popular tags that lead to even better porn.</p><p></p><p>Rule34Hentai also supports animated GIFs and webms. Just include the tag “animated” or “webm” and you’ll get great little clips. Rule34Hentai features thousands of animated content, and a lot of it is really high quality.</p><p></p><p>The main thing to get used to is to underscore your spaces. For example, if you want to see One Piece porn, you need to search “One_Piece”. Searching “One Piece” will just search the two words separately, and you’ll get dogshit results.</p><p></p><p>So bottom line, remember the underscore.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Chan-style porn searching</h3><p></p><p></p><p>When you first enter the site, you’ll see a gigantic search bar at the top, with a front-page gallery below. The front page gallery shows the latest uploaded images, so it’s cool to browse but you probably won’t find what you’re looking for here.</p><p></p><p>Along the left side of the page is another search bar, a featured image, and news feed. There are also some ads laying around but they are easy to spot and ignore. At the bottom left of the front page is a list of Popular Tags, which should give your cock some inspiration if you don’t have anything in mind.</p><p></p><p>Along the top of the page are the main links which include Upload, Comments, Picture Tags, and Wiki. All the content at Rule34Hentai is supplied by its users, and there are some seriously dedicated people out there pumping a shit-ton of porn.</p><p></p><p>Looking to be an uploader? Make sure to read the Wiki first. All uploaders are required to supply their images with a ton of high-quality tags, otherwise, the image will be rejected and eventually the user will be blocked.</p><p></p><p>Once you develop a good record of uploads, you can then become a “Trusted” user whose content won’t be prescreened. My point of all this is: Rule34Hentai works hard to make sure all the porn here is high quality and well-tagged. This is a big reason the search engine kicks ass.</p><p></p><p>Anyway, I know most of you are just here to fap, so let’s get back to the porn. As I said, most of you will want to use that big search bar at the top.</p><p></p><p>When you type in what you want to search for, don’t press enter yet. Wait a bit and you should see some tags pop up that have your term inside it. For example, I typed in “Fairy” and Rule34Hentai immediately recommended “Fairy_Tail”, “Fairy_Princess”, and more.</p><p></p><p>You also get to see the number of results you get from these tags, whether it’s the one you typed in or the ones recommended to you. This can help narrow down your search right off the bat. You can also see how many pics they have of the bitch you want to fap to.</p><p></p><p>Let’s say you just want to search your term, so you type it in and press Enter. You’ll see that rather than starting the search, the website just solidifies your term and then asks for another one. To actually search, you need to click on the Search button. This site expects multiple tags.</p><p></p><p>Click on a picture and you’ll get sent to the main content page. First, keep in mind you can always right-click the image to save it onto your computer. You’ll also get important information like uploader, tags, the source, and ratings. Images come from all kinds of places like DeviantArt, Patreon, and more.</p><p></p><p>There’s a lot of comics here too although it’s not well organized. Just search “comic” coupled with whatever you want to see and you’ll find all the comics for that term.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Refinement takes search to another level</h3><p></p><p></p><p>This works great when paired with “webm” or “animated”. For Webms, you’ll see Rule34Hentai recommend terms like 3D, Dragon Age, or Tomb Raider. These are the popular paired tags, and it’s a great way to see what kind of animations they have here.</p><p></p><p>I’m surprised I don’t see this feature on other porn sites. I found it really useful to see what’s popular and led me to discover some great fap material.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>What I Like</h3><p></p><p></p><p>The plentiful animations, whether its GIFs or WEBMs, keeps me coming back. Rule34Hentai made it so easy to pair these searches with characters or series, so you can know instantly if they have animations for your favorite characters.</p><p></p><p>There are some intro ads on the videos, but nothing terrible.</p><p></p><p>Rule34Hentai also gets a lot of updates every day. It’s a pretty popular site with lots of active users, so you can always depend on the community to add more shit.</p><p></p><p>I’ve seen users average hundreds of uploads a day (!), and based on the number of Patreons I ran into it looks like a lot of nerds make a living off this porn.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>What I Hate</h3><p></p><p></p><p>First, you won’t find any full episodes or even extended clips.</p><p></p><p>Rule34Hentai also isn’t great if you don’t have something in mind you want to jerk off to. Just browsing the porn is limited since they don’t have a \"highest viewed\" category. You can, however, find top-rated under the Sort link in the main menu. You pretty much have to work from tags to hone down what you want.</p><p></p><p>There’s also a lot of shitty art here. Since everything is user uploaded, and tags won’t really filter the ratings or quality, you can see a lot of shitty weird pictures.</p><p></p><p>When you browse by latest updates, you’ll see a lot of the gallery is clogged up by similar pics from the same series. A lot of the pics will look like they are being spammed, but actually, there are small differences in the image series that leads to the multiple uploads.</p><p></p><p>There’s also limited content when you try to search taboo topics extreme content. Frankly speaking, it seems both of those terms are banned for users who aren’t registered to the site. They also don’t allow video compilations.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Great picture gallery and underrated animations</h3><p></p><p></p><p>There’s also a lot of My Little Pony and furry shit if you swing that way. Personally, it ain’t my thing, but whatever gives you that good nut. That’s what I’m here for.</p><p></p><p>There is a lot of 3D CGI porn also, especially when it comes to Overwatch. There are over 100,000 3D pictures on Rule34Hentai. You’ll also find western-style porn like Jessica Rabbit or the Marvel superheroes numbering in the thousands.</p><p></p><p>If you want 100% unfiltered access to the site, you’ll have to register. Rule34Hentai will block more risqué topics like extremes fetishes to anonymous users. Whether tagged or not, there are definitely people monitoring all the content.</p>"}},{"id":"34184bc2ab51","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"34184bc2ab51","title":"R-34.xyz","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"R34.xyz is a fast-growing Rule 34 porn community with an R34 porn database is a great way to watch super sexy versions of mainstream content that are usually non-porn","canonical":"https://theporndude.com/zh/12951/r-34xyz","affiliate_url":"https://r-34.xyz/","rating":4,"siteOrder":15,"price":"free","tags":[],"features":[],"categories":[{"id":"hentai-porn-sites","collection":"categories_en"}],"screenshot_url":"https://cdn.staticstack.net/assets/img/r-thumbs/41a946e-r-34xyz_small.png","image_alt":"R34.xyz, adult anime porn site","scraped_at":"2025-10-28T19:39:04.023Z","iconSpritesheet":"custom-favicon-spritesheet.png","iconPosition":"-192px -640px","iconClassName":"ctm-icon12951","logoIconClass":"icon12951","pros":["a passionate rule 34 community that has uploaded a diverse array of smut","it has a reddit-style filter system, which is a great way to narrow down content","the site uses a sleek and modern theme that runs smoother than a cum-soaked dream"],"cons":["the two duplicate menus are a missed opportunity to display more pages on the site","there is no basic metadata attached to the content on the general portfolio"],"detailedDescription":"<p>Over the space of a few decades, the porn industry has gone to levels of popularity that many people never imagined was possible just a few years ago. In the wake of this porn boom, we’ve seen a wealth of smut being created by open-minded porn producers eager to try and keep up with the ever-dynamic demands of kinky porn fans worldwide.</p><p></p><p>This has seen a tonne of porn flicks being made that are loosely based on mainstream movies, TV, and music as an increasing number of people want to see the XXX version of things they see in real life. This brings us to the term Rule 34. Have you never heard of it? Well, allow me to explain!</p><p></p><p>Rule 34 started as an internet meme claiming that if a subject or topic exists, some form of porn has been made about it. Whether it’s a Game of Thrones-inspired porn movie starring some of the world’s most well-known adult actresses or Hentai-style fan art of non-erotic figures indulging in intense sexual activity, Rule 34 comes in many forms.</p><p></p><p>Hell, Rule 34 has even transcended from its status as an internet meme to become an entirely independent porn niche in itself. Many smut fanatics are eager to dive into the world of Rule 34 porn to see what kind of things that are often regarded as entirely non-erotic have been turned into explicitly sexual art by horny people worldwide.</p><p></p><p>To cater to this porn niche, an ever-growing number of websites have been popping up in recent years with a firm focus on it. But, as with many things in the porn world, it’s safe to say that not all of them have been created equally, and there are the same number of shitty sites to avoid as there are great sites to check out.</p><p></p><p>Luckily for you, you have the sticky but trusted hand of MissAVDH to guide your path through the world of R34 porn in the same way that Gollum guided Frodo and Sam through the Dead Marshes in The Return of the King and ended up fucking each ot- … oh, wait! That was the Rule 34 version!</p><p></p><p>Today, it’s time to meet a Rule 34 porn website called R-34.xyz. This site is said to be packed with GIFs, pictures, and videos all centered around the concept of Rule 34 with the ability to blow your mind by hyper-sexualizing some of the most non-erotic content you can think of. Well, that’s what they say, but is it true? Let’s find out!</p><p></p><p></p><h3>What is R-34.xyz?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>The site is mostly free to use, although there is a premium membership on offer that offers benefits such as ad-free browsing and the ability to subscribe to up to 15 porn tags on the site. It’s pretty cheap and will set premium users back $20 a year.</p><p></p><p>The site hasn’t been around for that long, and after a quick search through the internet archives, we can see that it was founded in 2022. Nevertheless, the site appears to offer a decent array of Rule 34 porn, so I was keen to slide balls-deep into it and see whether its porn portfolio was up to scratch!</p><p></p><p></p><h3>What’s the Rule 34 Porn Like on R-34.xyz?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Now, if you’re a regular reader of MissAVDH, you’ll know that one of my main aims is to save my fellow porn fans time and give them the gist of every porn site in the fastest way possible so they can dedicate more of their time to sweet, sweet masturbation. My review of R-34.xyz is no exception, and I’m about to provide you with the sticky highlights of the site’s porn!</p><p></p><p>● Uh, Sonia… What Pokemon Are Those? - Remember Sonia from Pokemon? This Rule 34 porn shows the redhead cartoon character taking a break from catching Pokemon to indulge in her side passion for BBC. On her knees with her hairy pussy bursting out of her panties, she’s straddled by two black cocks pumping gallons of sticky cum over her massive tits. How her body is decorated with multicolored condoms full of cum is a beautiful touch, too!</p><p>● Jill Valentine Gets Pounded by an Umbrella Soldier in a Post-Apocolypic Fuck - This Rule 34 porn is a dream come true for Resident Evil fans and shows Jil Valentine bent over with one leg in the air as she’s fucked from behind by a big-dicked Umbrella Soldier while the world burns in the background. This is super realistic, and how her huge tits bounce in the wake of this dick is stunning!</p><p>● Wet Ass Pussy (With a Twist!) - You know the Cardi B and Meghan Thee Stallion song Wet Ass Pussy? There was no doubt millions of people who wanted to see a more hardcore version of the already erotic music video. This AI-generated artwork shows the two ebony sex symbols posing in porn-style outfits, but one has a huge black cock aiming straight at the other’s ass to twist up the two female rap icons in a Futanari-style Rule 34 porn picture.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Design of the Site</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Below this is the site’s bread and butter, a portfolio of Rule 34 porn. These are displayed in rows of eight thumbnails like an image gallery. Any content that is a GIF or video has a duration button displayed in the top right corner, but other than that, there’s no metadata accompanying each piece of smut.</p><p></p><p>The left of this porn collection is a vertical sidebar menu that contains the exact same series of links that the burger menu in the top bar of the site contains. The menu takes you to places like the homepage, the hottest porn on the site, the best smut according to user ratings, subscriptions and liked content according to individual profiles, an upload button, and a premium membership offer.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>What I Like Most About it</h3><p></p><p></p><p>One of the things I love about NSFW communities like Reddit is how it allows you to filter content according to what has been rated as the best of the day, week, month, year, or of all time. So I was happy to see that R-34.xyz had implemented a similar system on their site’s ‘’Best’’ section. There are two sections at the top of the porn portfolio on this page that let you filter out the highest-rated content according to views and ratings, as well as a separate button that lets you further filter the results according to days, weeks, months, and of all time.</p><p></p><p>The theme that the site is using does a fine job of displaying the vast array of porn spread across it. I encountered no buffering or waiting times while exploring the site. I also loved that most people had taken steps to credit the original artists in the metadata accompanying each piece of porn when you click on it. I wish the metadata were displayed in the portfolio rather than within each piece of content, which brings me to the next section.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>What I Don’t Like</h3><p></p><p></p><p>The site also has two menus in the form of a burger menu and a sidebar menu, but they’re both identical. The site has missed a crucial opportunity to add more vital pages via one of the menus rather than duplicating them. But don’t worry; I’ll give you some pointers on how to fix this in the next section.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Suggestions I Have for R-34.xyz</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Also, take advantage of having two menus by adding different pages on each one. For example, a new main menu could contain an About page or blog post detailing what Rule 34 is and the benefits it can offer to porn-hungry people, as this will be ideal for people first finding out about the site and the concept of Rule 34.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p></p>"}},{"id":"fba42b2aa25a","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"fba42b2aa25a","title":"HypnoHub","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"HypnoHub.net is a Danbooru style picture website dedicated to hypnotic porn content Hypno Hub is not themed on breasts and ass but on zombie-like girls swirl-like eyes and mind control scenes you will be here...","canonical":"https://theporndude.com/zh/3190/hypnohub","affiliate_url":"https://hypnohub.net/","rating":4,"siteOrder":16,"price":"free","tags":[],"features":[],"categories":[{"id":"hentai-porn-sites","collection":"categories_en"}],"screenshot_url":"https://cdn.staticstack.net/assets/img/r-thumbs/7445989-hypnohub_small.png","image_alt":"HypnoHub, adult anime porn site","scraped_at":"2025-10-28T19:39:09.638Z","iconSpritesheet":"custom-favicon-spritesheet.png","iconPosition":"-384px -304px","iconClassName":"ctm-icon3190","logoIconClass":"icon3190","pros":["solid execution of the danbooru-style porn site","over 50,000 images all about hypnotized bitches"],"cons":["lots of sfw content","no videos or other types of content"],"detailedDescription":"<p>Looking for a hypnobooru? Want to get hypnotized at Hypno Hub? If you could hypnotize a bitch into fucking you, would you do it? Rhetorical question of course, why the hell would you not!? There's something beautiful about a dazed and confused (18+)girl absentmindedly sucking on your cock, no matter how much she regrets it later.</p><p></p><p>Dangerous words I know, especially with all this woke bullshit going on, but it's true. How do I know? Cause Hypno Hub is a popular porn site that is all about hypnotized bitches getting fucked like it's going out of style.</p><p></p><p>You'll find all kinds of hentai (18+)girls with blank or hypnotized eyes, caught in a strange trance where they suddenly feel the need to get naked and head straight to the nearest cock. Of course, as men, we are only happy to oblige. It’s not my fault that the bitch can't control her own mind.</p><p></p><p>HypnoHub is a Danbooru-style board that caters especially to girls in trance-like states. Most of the images will have hypnotic imagery. Mind control is a common theme where a bitch doesn't seem to have control over her own body.</p><p></p><p>Ever watch the Outer Limits episode where a big black dildo starts emitting smoke that makes Alyssa Milano suddenly need to take all the cocks in town? Well, you watch that shit and you're sure to develop a hypnotism fetish, trust me.</p><p></p><p>As a Danbooru style board, HypnoHub is all about the tags. Every image will have tons of tags, so you can do deep searches into your fetish. Why search for hypnotized cunt when you can search blond-haired hypnotized cunt? Now that's customization.</p><p></p><p>Since this site is more about hypnotism than porn, you'll find a lot of SFW images also. There's a lot of interesting pics about hypnotism like an anime scientist showing off his mind control helmet. Or a story of Tifa Lockheart getting hypnotized by Shinra to masturbate in front of the company headquarters.</p><p></p><p>As I said, this place goes beyond just porn, but is more about the mental shit with regards to hypnotized or mind-controlled girls.</p><h3>All about the tags</h3><p></p><p></p><p>There are also links to Posts, Comments, Tags, and Forum. A small arrow will lead you to a full menu page, that has all kinds of other options like sorting by popularity, browsing, history, Random, and more. You can even browse recently deleted content.</p><p></p><p>Whether you search or browse, the main body of the site will be the gallery. You’ll see a bunch of thumbnails for your search results, with popular tags to add to your search on the left. You’ll see some colors too, like purple text showing series title or green text being character names.</p><p></p><p>Hover your mouse over a thumbnail to see some basic information, including rating, tags, title, and uploader.</p><p>Click on an image to get to the main image viewer. You’ll see your pic or animated GIF, along with the comments below. At the bottom of the page, you can add your own too.</p><p></p><p>Along the left side of the page, you’ll get a bunch of stats on the pic including the source link, the image size, upload date, and what users favorited it. There are also download links, mod reporting, and more. If you want to quickly jump from pic to pic, you’ll see a Related Posts section where you can click Next or Previous image.</p><p></p><p>HypnoHub also has a forum, although it operates more like a Chan-style message board that updates based on the latest comment. Check out the Sticky threads, especially the “New To Hypnohub?” to get a quick overview on how to use this site. Hypnohub also has a <a href=\"https://MissAVDH.com/blog/top-15-most-popular-porn-discord-servers-2019-edition/\">Discord channel</a> you can also find in the main links.</p><p></p><p>If you like this type of layout, check out the “Other Booru’s” section from the main links. You can find dedicated Danbooru-style boards for Rule 34, hentai, and more.</p><h3>Hypnotism goes great with Rule 34</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Include “animated_gif” in your tag for all the animations. These GIFs work great with the swirly eyes, creating a bizarre effect where you’re trying to fap to their pussy while not staring at their zany eyes.</p><p></p><p>For such a specific fetish, a lot of the art is surprisingly high quality. I was expecting a ton of MSPaint shit drawn by amateurs for the sake of hypnotism, but I guess this niche is big enough to attract some serious artists.</p><p></p><p>The HypnoHub archives also have pics with stories. These little text stories will usually tell a hypnotism story to go along with the pic. There are also some comics here, although nothing long-running.</p><p></p><p>Sometimes I think this should be called eye fetish instead of Hypno fetish. Most of the pics revolve around some kind of eye manipulation, like spiral eyes, glowing eyes, or symbols in eyes. You know you’re fapping too much when regular eyes just don’t do it anymore.</p><h3>What I Like</h3><p></p><p></p><p>I’m a big fan of the style personally, and HypnoHub doesn’t fuck it up in any major way. I love that the tags are color-coded, and usually, the tag list will be organized as such so you can quickly browse the characters, series, or tags all in one list.</p><p></p><p>HypnoHub also puts a lot of emphasis on femsub porn. Almost all of the porn adds female sub situations, whether it’s a harem of sex slaves or mental takeover of just one babe.</p><p></p><p>The content here blends a good amount of story with the actual pictures. The fetish is really mental-based, so the narrative is important to the fap more than traditional porn. You’ll find a lot of porn here that adds dialogue or story to give it a unique twist.</p><h3>What I Hate</h3><p></p><p></p><p>I saw a lot of porn that just looks like generic hentai, and the admins themselves admit that their guidelines for the content here are pretty loose.</p><p></p><p>HypnoHub also has a lot of images that aren’t necessarily porn. You’ll find plenty of clothed bitches here as well, especially when the focus is more on the mind control than the ass and titties. This is kind of annoying when I want to fap, but I do admit the images are categorized by NSFW content as well.</p><p></p><p>This type of site can also be awkward to use if you’re not used to it. New users will be turned off by the use of underscores for spaces, the strict rules that tags follow, and the fact that important features like blacklisting tags requires user registration.</p><p></p><p>HypnoHub also maintains strict rules against lolicon/shotacon. They are really sensitive about rule 34 porn here as well as copyrighted content. Finally, HypnoHub will tolerate but not promote real women pictures, so you won’t find much of that here.</p><h3>A rare niche that’s found a great audience</h3><p></p><p></p><p>A lot of HypnoHub is about the feeling of dominating a woman’s mind, where a girl doesn’t even know how to say no let alone where she is.</p><p></p><p>There’s a dedicated staff at HypnoHub that works hard to maintain quality control and rule enforcement. Sometimes you’ll wonder why a pic or GIF got posted here since it doesn’t seem to have anything to do with hypnotism, but the general theme is maintained pretty well overall.</p><p></p><p>With mind regression, mind control, and all kinds of wacky-looking eyes, HypnoHub is sure to please the special few of you who are into this shit. For the rest of us, there are better places to find fap food, especially considering that a lot of these pics don’t even show tits or ass. To me, that is mental torture.</p>"}},{"id":"14f9fecfb268","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"14f9fecfb268","title":"LoLHentai","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"Lolhentai.netLol Hentai is likely to be the only website that shares slutty pictures and videos that feature your favorite League of Legends characters as the main character to combine Japanese anime and games who can think of it?

But if you’re going to be down there anyway, at least you won’t find a better place to protect you from the shame of browsing lolhentai.net. Lol porn aka League of Legends hentai porn is an example of what happens when you give people who hang out on the Internet way too much free time on their hands, combining everything about hentai porn with the League of Legends game. All your favorite characters are here in full Rule-34 glory.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Great artwork of all your favs</h3><p></p><p></p><p>The galleries on Lolhentai are a collection of user-submitted content and the best League of Legends-related content you pervs might have seen elsewhere. The majority of the galleries are sorted by characters. All the major League of Legend characters you’d expect to find here are represented – Ahri, Ashe, Narny, Caitlyn and more, with a number to indicate just how many pictures are in each gallery and some featuring an ‘updated’ graphic floating above to let you know there’s new content. There's a gallery of recent uploads to capture your fancy and above that, the navigation bar. There’s a section on the side for news and latest user-submitted comments.</p><p></p><p>So let’s talk about the art. Videos and images are sorted in a multitude of different options: group, gifs, futanari, male, gender-bender, cosplay and comics in English, Chinese or Korean. How wild is that? Since the artwork is mostly culled from the collection of fans, there’s no baseline in quality. You’re getting a mix of jaw-dropping art featuring the best LoL girls and stuff that looks like it could have been left on DeviantArt. But for the most part, your favorite characters are here in drool-worthy glory, in a bucket list of scenarios. Big tits, skinny waists, bubble butts, and gorgeous smiles – what more can you want?</p><p></p><p>We gotta talk about these bonus albums because some of this shit is absolutely wild. The male-only content is about 500 images of furries. Furries! Cool that that's out there for some of you... There's a good chunk of images featuring the two male burly leads from the game doing things I really didn’t need to see, but I’m sure will make the females reading this very happy.</p><p></p><p>It gets even wilder. We’re talking group photos aka the best girl-on-girl-on-girl action you could ask for; futanari, which is just super weird to even think about considering these are video game characters (who are now sporting dicks); Gender bender, which to me, looks super confusing; and Cosplay, which is AMAZING. These girls love dressing to the nines as the character of their choice, indulging in some wild activities for the camera. This is the shit I’m into – can the site just entirely be cosplay?</p><p></p><p>Realizing this, I was really excited to check out the Videos tab. Amateur porn in costumes? I can get behind that. So I was a little disappointed to see the video content in that department to be a little underwhelming. What you’ll see in the section mostly consists of 3D-generated videos and CG sets, fully animated. To its credit, the videos are pretty good! I’d just love to see more full-length videos and...you know...less of that computer generated and more of that real stuff, you know what I mean?</p><p></p><p>The comics archive is well archived. Offering doujin comics in three different languages, there’s plenty of well-titilated babe action for your reading pleasure. Just click a comic and read – there’s nothing more to it! The comics are sorted by keywords too, making it easy to find some of your favourites after you’ve spent some time in the archives. The English archive isn’t as robust as the Chinese or Korean sections, but does language really matter when we’re talking about hot women getting fucked? You think about it and get back to me.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Clean Layouts that won’t make your eyes bleed</h3><p></p><p></p><p>I’m not gonna lie: it got to me. Support your hentai websites. They know what’s up. The one great thing they have going for them is amazing web development. Browsing Lolhentai.net in night mode is a godsend. All you porn web developers trying to get into the hustle, I have some advice for you: employ minimal, dark designs. Keep it simple, loser. Geeks will be thanking you after a 4 AM wank, especially if they’re also coming off an all night gaming session.</p><p></p><p>With that said, the site design not entirely perfect. There's an offer at the bottom right of the page inviting users to join Hentai Pros for only a dollar. It’s not entirely distracting but with a layout that’s so clean and simple, it sticks out like an eyesore. My two cents: could we maybe talk about putting it somewhere else? Like at the top? Or maybe next to a picture enticing you to sign up? I imagine plenty of people could get into that.</p><p></p><p>I’m still bummed about the video content too. We need more cosplay! Full-length videos! It’s a start but I’m hoping that with the user-submitted aspect of the site, we start seeing some prodigious users take up the mantle and film what we need to see. On second thought, maybe watching overweight people in bad costumes isn’t what we need to see after all...</p><p></p><p>Nothing on Lolhentai.net is making a strong case for me signing up and playing League of Legends. If I’m being honest, that’s probably a good thing – I spend far too much time having an actual real life as it is, unlike you losers. But what we have on Lolhentai.net...it ain’t all bad. So if your interests include hentai, video games and League of Legends, then you’ll enjoy the shit out of the website. It helps to know your niche as they say and this place is home to some of the biggest League of Legends related hentai content available on the Internet. It’s hot characters made even hotter. You can’t argue with that.</p><p></p><p>But then again, you have to think about the life decisions made to have you end up on Lolhentai.net in the first place…</p>"}},{"id":"485b7977bd3f","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"485b7977bd3f","title":"Derpibooru","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"DerpiBooru.org is a brainless fan of Little Pony and all the friendship with Little Pony is magical and perverted paradise.

Yeah, I’m talking about bronies and the object of their obsession, My Little Pony. Until the other day, I didn’t even realize that anything like DerpiBooru.org even existed.</p><p></p><p>I’m not usually this late to the party, especially one that gets nearly 3.5 million visits a month, but I guess that’s because I usually go to parties where there are women. Now, I’m not saying every single horse-fucker on this website is a fat neckbeard living in his mom’s basement and playing with some of the girliest toys imaginable, but have you looked in a mirror lately? Yeah, I bet they all look like you.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Your Best Friends Are All Perverts</h3><p></p><p></p><p>DerpiBooru is another serious fucking commitment. It’s not rocket science to set up a booru-style imageboard, but it does take time, effort and resources. Not only has some team of completely well-adjusted fat guys built the site, but they also have a very active community constantly posting My Little Pony content.</p><p></p><p>Most of the sites I review for MissAVDH are just full of hardcore porn and nothing else.</p><p></p><p>You may be able to use the filters to block the overtly sexual content here, but there’s absolutely no blocking the subtle, defiantly sexual subtext that lurks behind every seemingly innocent picture of a cute pink horse, shivering in fear. Why’s the poor girl shaking? Is it because there’s a hairy, overweight man with bad hygiene shaking his smegma-covered micropenis at her? Again, look in the mirror, because we both know the answer to that question.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Family Fun for All, Plus Cartoon Horse Porn</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Like any imageboard in this style, the front page is just a constantly updated stream of My Little Pony content created by DerpiBooru’s enthusiastic user base of bronies. These motherfuckers are prolific. Linger on the site for a few minutes, refresh the page, and you’ll have new amateur drawings of prancing ponies, pregnant ponies who have become so overinflated they can’t move at all, ponies posing in cute dresses and other ponies posing naked with their huge twats and wrinkled assholes exposed. There’s also a pony cutely scowling at something while frolicking in an apple orchard.</p><p></p><p>The very existence of all the G-rated content on DerpiBooru exposes the truth: bronies really do love these goddamn kid horses. It’s not just a sexual obsession, some weirdo jacking off while watching a cartoon about animal friendship. It’s a crush, nay, a burning love that can never be requited. These poor men will never be able to marry their true loves, but if there is one consolation, it is that the toys are widely available and can be brought home with basically no effort. Then again, they weren’t designed with fucking in mind so good luck finding a decent entry.</p><p></p><p>DerpiBooru runs on Patreon donations, which is more evidence that these perverts are truly in love with Twilight Sparkle, Rainbow Dash, Pinkie pie and the whole My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic gang. You don’t get access to any extra shit with your donation, which is cool for the cheapskates who live with mom and have no source of income. I assume that’s most of the users here. They’ve got almost 300 patrons right now out of their millions of visitors, offering up a little over a grand. They must have spent all their money on children’s toys.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Chat with Your Fellow Brony Man-Children</h3><p></p><p></p><p>A lot of imageboards have areas meant for people to talk about things, but they’re usually ghost towns. Most of the forums here have had new posts within the last 20 minutes.</p><p></p><p>I checked out the General discussion area since it seemed to have the most going on, with nearly 4000 active topics. The newest thread was about posting your favorite images. Do you know what’s really fucking bizarre? Barely any of them are explicit at all. One absolute pervert posted a drawing of a pony strip club orgy, but everyone else’s favorite is some really girly, boring shit. There are big-eyed ponies crying, flying, looking adorably angry or rising slowly out of a hole in a way that would almost be erotic were it not a goddamn cartoon pony without genitals.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>More My Little Pony Erotica Than I’ve Ever Seen!</h3><p></p><p></p><p>The story starts off with a bunch of cartoon ponies, dragons, and a Griffin. Somebody starts masturbating by rubbing herself between the legs with a balloon. The dragon sucked a hot and hard horn on a bug all evening until midnight, and there was some other really vague, one-sentence sex between the bug, the reptile, the pony, the cow, and two birds.</p><p></p><p>It’s a fucking terrible story, just one paragraph with basically no detail. The author did take the time to pull a bunch of visibly relevant, but not remotely sexual, screengrabs from the show.</p><p></p><p>I checked out more stories and was surprised to find most of them were like this. Usually, if you find a thriving lit erotica board, it’s full of well-written smut about absolutely obscene shit. This shit is absolutely obscene, but it’s so sloppy and short I have to wonder if it’s written by the demographic My Little Pony is actually aimed at. It’s so vague, I have a difficult time imagining anybody could possibly get off to it.</p><p></p><p>DerpiBooru.org (often misspelled as \"derpybooru\") is a weird fucking place, but I’m sure the bronies who frequent it already know that. It’s obviously not a site that everyone is going to get something out of, but it’s also obvious that the users here are really into their animated horses. If you’re into My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic, and also happen to be a pervert who wants to have sex with cartoon animals, you’re definitely going to love DerpiBooru.</p>"}},{"id":"a8ee7be0b785","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"a8ee7be0b785","title":"Pixiv","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"Pixiv.com's R18 part has a group of the best and most authoritative perverts in the world to release your own perverted adult anime or use constantly updated porn art to fuck a tube to watch the 2D slut's nipples being fucked by bisexuals randomly shit rabbit people and others...","canonical":"https://theporndude.com/zh/4448/pixiv","affiliate_url":"https://www.pixiv.net/cate_r18.php","rating":4,"siteOrder":19,"price":"free","tags":[],"features":["动漫"],"categories":[{"id":"hentai-porn-sites","collection":"categories_en"}],"screenshot_url":"https://cdn.staticstack.net/assets/img/r-thumbs/a994bf0-pixiv_small.png","image_alt":"Pixiv, adult anime porn site","scraped_at":"2025-10-28T19:39:27.445Z","iconSpritesheet":"custom-favicon-spritesheet.png","iconPosition":"-192px -400px","iconClassName":"ctm-icon4448","logoIconClass":"icon4448","pros":["thriving artist community of perverts","nonstop updates of original hentai and other porn art","really kinky sex novels","uncensored original hentai"],"cons":["registration required to view anything"],"detailedDescription":"<p>The Internet is a fucking amazing place. I’m always seeking out the seedier, dirtier, kinkier places out there on the web, and sometimes I’m really surprised where I find pornography. I recently discovered an extensive and growing collection of really freaky-ass porn art on an online community for artists. I guess I shouldn’t have been that surprised about all the hentai, since this Internet art community is based in Japan. Once again, I have to extend my gratitude to The Land of the Rising Sun for bringing extreme perversion to what would otherwise be a wholesome hang out for art fags.</p><p></p><p>Pixiv.net has been around since 2007 and it’s a pretty fucking hopping community. They get well over 200 million visits a month, though it’s unclear how many are jacking off and how many are just posting their clean, non-pornographic drawings of anime (18+)teens, manga action dudes, and cute little kitty cats. I’m the kind of guy who will compulsively pull his pud to just about anything, but I’ll definitely be heading straight for the R-18 section.</p><h3>Sign Up or You Don’t Get to Play</h3><p></p><p></p><p>I used a disposable email address and registered in a few minutes. I tried to get to the R-18 section via the link in the header, but Pixiv told me I wasn’t allowed to look at that yet. I scoured the confirmation email for something I’d missed. Eventually, I found the filter options in my user profile. The grown-up stuff is blocked by default, so you have to unblock it if you’re looking for the hentai.</p><p></p><p>Once I got my filter situation set up, it was off to the races. The front page of the R-18 area shows the newest adult material on the website. It’s displayed as you’d find on any imageboard, with thumbnails leading to bigger versions.</p><p></p><p>I’ve always got to give it to you hentai motherfuckers for coming up with the most perverted shit out there. I say that as a jaded pervert who looks at hardcore porn literally all day, every day. I watch teenagers(young adults) get their anal cherries popped all the goddamn time, and I’m still surprised by the porn art I find on sites like Pixiv.</p><p></p><p>There are fetish sluts in red PVC bondage gear, and big-titted anime princesses all tied up but with less enthusiasm about the situation. There are thick girls getting pounded by cock and horny teens baring it all. There are airtight orgies and naked mermaids with beautiful asses, manga girls getting choked and fucked at the same time, and explicit but cartoonishly drawn gay butt sex. And I have even mentioned the fucking weird shit yet!</p><h3>As Filthy as Hentai Should Be</h3><p></p><p></p><p>One of the newest images is a clean-lined manga drawing called StepMom of the Year. StepMom is getting a deep dicking from behind, her stepson putting his dingdong back in the hole from whence he came. I really appreciate that even though this is a Japanese site, the big veiny penis and shaved cunt are both clearly visible, not censored or obscured in either way. I also really like that this is Mom of the Year and not Stepmom of the Year, doing away with that whole not-really-related dance you get with most taboo porn.</p><p></p><p>But explicit taboo porn isn’t too kinky, is it? I’ve got a whole section of Taboo Porn Sites, and there are a handful that dispense with the stepfamily bullshit. What you can’t really find on typical porn sites is the freaky futanari bitch with the horns and the tail of a devil, the titties of a goddess, and the enormous wiener of King Kong. Most sites for adult perverts don’t have any princesses with inverted nipples, manga girls shitting on the floor, or green-skinned giant bitches about to eat tiny little dudes in vore porn.</p><h3>Rabbits Fucking People and Nipples Getting Penetrated</h3><p></p><p></p><p>The community element of Pixiv is on full display here. The artist posted a little blurb about the set he’s working on. Apparently this kinky broad getting fucked in her nipples is part of the series of freakishly weird porn this dude has been making. He posted a link to a poll where fans can choose the next character he draws getting fucked in some bizarre fashion.</p><p></p><p>I followed a link back to this dude’s profile. Pixiv gives artists a platform to post their work and provide a lot of info to fans and potential fans. This guy’s an English speaker with a couple of patrons on his Patreon. He creates his furry butt sex, giant cock milking, and monster lady semen inflation images with 3DS Max, Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop. Aspiring hentai pornographers, take note!</p><p></p><p>There is a big +Follow button next to every image, right under the creator’s name and avatar. If you find an artist that does really good futanari sumo wrestlers or the best foot fetish hentai you ever have seen, it’s easy to set up a personal stream of your favorite porn art. Speaking of personal streams, yeah, there are definitely a ton of golden showers on this website.</p><h3>The Most Popular Amateur Hentai Every Day</h3><p></p><p></p><p>I’m mainly here for the dirty pictures of broads, so I stick to the default dude mode. The Daily Ranking shows the overall most popular content in the R-18 area, including Illustrations, Ugoira, Manga, and Novels. Until now, I didn’t even realize this site had novels. Based on all the other weird shit I’ve seen on Pixiv so far, it seems like it’d be a veritable freak show of Literotica. Let’s check it out, shall we?</p><p></p><p>Most of the stories are written in Japanese. Since I have to rely on my browser’s built-in translation, the text isn’t always that smooth. Still, it’s easy enough to understand what happens in one of today’s most popular stories, The Story of the Eldest Daughter Who Made a Mistake. It’s all about people getting off with the demons, embryos and ecstatic fluid squirting all over the fucking place. Yeah, that’s exactly what my browser’s built-in translation called the juice squirting on the walls in the climax to the sexual epics.</p><p></p><p>There’s such a wide variety of unexpected, balls-out crazy depravity on Pixiv’s R-18 section that even a sightseer with their dick in their pants can get a kick out of a visit. There’s such a high level of activity, though, that it’s clear most of the users are very sincere in their appreciation for extremely perverse hentai and other sex art. The site is set up to really encourage artists and build a community, and they succeed at that goal. If you’ve been looking for a place to post your original BBW inflation renders or fox lady masturbation drawings, look no further. Fans are highly encouraged to join the community as well.</p>"}},{"id":"6a69b97069f2","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"6a69b97069f2","title":"FapService","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"FapService.comFap Service is a website focused on displaying the latest and best comics and animations for fans.

Well, I'm already liking the domain name! While Western cartoons typically don’t have this, Japanese cartoons and comics are famous for having fanservice scenes, where the audience will get a nice moment watching the bitches on the show take a shower, prance around in their underwear, and more.</p><p></p><p>The best part about fan service is that since its part of the original show, the voice acting and the art will be on point, compared to the tons of shitty fan-made Rule 34 porn that is commonly found and fapped to.</p><p></p><p>Fapservice.com is a cool little site that completely dedicates itself to fanservice scenes and Ecchi animes. It has one of the internet’s best collection of both anime and manga fan service clips, so you don’t need to dig through episode by episode to get your fap on.</p><p></p><p>Fap Service conveniently lists hundreds of shows so you can get straight to the good stuff. Even classic titles like Berserk and Ranma ½ have every sex scene laid out conveniently for your dick’s consumption. Want to relive the crazy horse scene? It’s never been easier.</p><p></p><p>While Fapservice.com is great at living up to its name, the content is still somewhat limited, and it’s not the best place to find new stuff to fap to. This place is a lot better if you have an anime you already like and want to fap to the key sexy parts of it. There isn’t any Rule 34 content, and the hentai stuff is really limited.</p><p></p><p>It’s important to keep in mind that this place isn’t just for fapping, but also for anime reviews and discussion. There are huge blog posts that break down the latest episodes of popular anime, and these are as much episode recaps as they are reviews of the fanservice scenes. You can tell that there are some hardcore anime fans behind Fapservice.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>WordPress at its finest</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Along the top of the page are the major links which include Fanservice Compilations, Manga Fanservice Compilations, and Upcoming BD releases. Fanservice Compilations refers to anime scenes, while Manga Fan Service Compilations (obviously) relates to manga scenes.</p><p></p><p>When you click on these links, you’ll be greeted with a huge list of all the animes and mangas that are featured on Fapservice. This is why I think it’s better if you know what you’re looking for going in. The series are conveniently listed in alphabetical order, making it easy for you to quickly find the show that you are interested in fapping to.</p><p></p><p>When you actually click on a series, you’ll get to check out the actual fan service content. For animes, this includes stream clips, a quick description, and download links. Sadly, a ton of the stream links are broken because the site used Vidme as its host, and Vidme no longer exists. Your best bet is the direct download (which uses Mediafire), or the torrent file.</p><p></p><p>The Manga pages are far simpler. When you click on a manga series, you’ll be treated to a huge image dump of all the sex scenes in the entire manga. Luckily for us, Fapservice does its best to update the latest sex scenes when new chapters come out for these manga. Just zoom into the page and get to fapping!</p><p></p><p>At the bottom of any series page, you’ll find a useful Disqus chat thread. There are a lot of big anime fans on this site, and you can always find conversation for the popular series. Users will also post their own Ecchi pics here, for some additional fap ammunition.</p><p></p><p>Other major links include Upcoming BD releases, Donation page, and Chat. The chat link will send you to Fapservice’s Discord channel, which is pretty active and users post some porn there also. Definitely check it out if you love anime.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Boobs and Panties galore!</h3><p></p><p></p><p>A cool feature of Fapservice is that instead of just throwing porn at you, there is also a lot of explanation of the ladies that you are pulling your cock to. Some of the compilation pages show who all the female characters are, as well as thoughts about the anime and analysis of the plot.</p><p></p><p>There’s even analysis on the fanservice itself, which I find hilarious that people read this shit. Like I said before, you can truly feel the passion of the site creator (known as WizardofEcchi), as he furiously writes about his favorite bitch, the quality of the fan service, and other Ph.D. level discussion on how fappable these cartoons are.</p><p></p><p>The site also keeps track of upcoming releases, so true anime fans can salivate over new fanservice scenes in the future.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>What I Like</h3><p></p><p></p><p>I also have a lot of respect for this turbo nerd called WizardofEcchi, who seems to be behind most of this content. Rather than just dumping a bunch of porn, he goes out of his way to give a laser-like analysis of all the characters, the overall quality, and direction of the anime, and all sorts of other nerd shit.</p><p></p><p>What this does is attract a big audience that goes beyond simple perverts like me. Fapservice actually has some great conversations through its Disqus and Discord discussion forums, and people here are clearly very passionate about anime.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>What I Hate</h3><p></p><p></p><p>On the other hand, the Mediafire and BitTorrent links are still alive, so you can just download the porn. Also, the manga sections are all working just fine.</p><p></p><p>If you’re strictly looking to fap, Fapservice also isn’t necessarily the best place, especially if you aren’t a big fan of anime. Most of the shit here is Ecchi scenes, meaning it’s not as explicit and hardcore as usual porn. A lot of this stuff is just breast scenes or shower scenes, rather than some legit dickriding action.</p><p></p><p>Finally, although there aren’t a lot of ads on Fapservice you’ll notice that the wallpaper is a big advertisement for a hentai online game. The wallpaper actually fits well with the theme of the website, but it’s hard to overlook that a huge advertisement basically decorates the entire site. Aside from this, the ads are minimal.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Suggestions</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Secondly, I wish the real fap material was more accessible. Fanservice is cool, but a lot of times it is just nipple shots or upskirt shots that don’t really inspire a grade-A boner. I understand that Fapservice isn’t a hentai site, but it could still use some hentai to live up to its name.</p><p></p><p>One recommendation I would have is to gather all the best stuff into one easy-to-find section. All the content is categorized by series title, so even if there is a random grade-A sex scene, it’s impossible to find unless you are a huge anime nerd.

The owner, WizardofEcchi, also seems to focus more on the anime rather than just fapping itself.

Ever want to see Mercy or DVA from Overwatch give amazing blowjobs or watch that thick bitch 2B for Nier: Automata get fucked? The answer should always be an eager yes. You can see all of that and more in the wonderful world of hentai porn. It comes in all kinds of sexy formats. Pictures, videos, SFM animations, VR, and more. No other kind of porn allows all of your darkest, kinkiest fantasies to come to life. Watch impossibly proportioned sluts get fucked in every hole by a tentacle monster, get into the crazy fetish of vore or giantess porn, or fuck your favorite character with your VR setup. The options are limitless, and today I’m dishing out the details for one of my favorite hentai sites out there.</p><p></p><p>Thehentaiworld.com is a site dedicated to providing the newest and best hentai porn pics from all of the most popular artists out there. You’ll find the odd gif or SFM video on here, but the site's focus is on pictures. It makes up much of the content here. And The Hentai World has been cataloging the very best hentai out there since early 2010. With nearly a decade of experience, these guys know what they are doing. Despite being a relative niche site, they bring in 2.5 million new visitors every month.</p><p></p><p>When you first head to Thehentaiworld.com you will be sent to a page that looks a bit like a search engine. It simply has its logo atop a search bar with a minimal header up top for “new hentai, updated, comments, tags, contact, register, login, and hentai porn sites.” I can already see MissAVDH logo up in the top right next to “hentai porn sites.” Hell yeah, that’s what I like to see! But below the search bar, they have a list of announcements. The top one says that they got rid of misleading ads. Good on you. I hate that shit.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Nice Minimal Site Design and Easy to Use Search Features</h3><p></p><p></p><p>A solid 20 or so images. That’s not too bad for a single character from a newer anime. You get a ton more if you just search for the anime itself. But let’s explore some more before we settle down and look at these pics. You can either keep searching using the bar or head to the left and skim through the suggested tags, which are handily color coated. The ones in red are artists, the green ones are characters, purple is the origin of that character, blue is the format, and white is miscellaneous. Now that’s pretty fucking neat. But regardless of the color, next to each tag is a number that shows how many images are in that gallery.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Extensive Catalog of Images from Many Different Hentai Artists</h3><p></p><p></p><p>The tab for comments is straight forward. It just shows you the most recent comments and what picture they were on. I really don’t think this tab is that necessary. I don’t find myself wishing I could see the most recent comments by some horny dude on a picture of Louis from Family Guy getting fucked by Quagmire. Usually, the comments aren’t anything insightful. It’s not like this is a forum or something where the comments are more important.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Unique Tags System Makes Navigation a Breeze</h3><p></p><p></p><p>When you finally settle down and find something you like just click on the preview image and you’ll be taken to a page with a bigger picture, title/name of the anime/character, artist name, and origin of the character. You can even click on a tab on the left for the full resolution of the image that you can download. And the quality of these pictures are fucking great. You can see every little detail here, and the artists themselves are fucking awesome. No poorly drawn cringe art here. Only professional level hentai pictures.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Can’t Flip Between Similar Images and A Poor Mobile Setup</h3><p></p><p></p><p>The mobile site is okay. You get quite a few more ads and pop-ups there compared to the desktop counterpart, but most of the site functions remain intact. It’s just not very nice to look at. You get a single row of small previews mixed with ads when you search on mobile. It’s a bit more difficult to click on the individual tags here as well. It’s not unusable by any means, but it has quite a bit of room for improvement.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>MissAVDH’s Favorite Features</h3><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>MissAVDH’s Suggestions</h3><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>MissAVDH’s Final Thoughts</h3><p></p>"}},{"id":"f75952687595","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"f75952687595","title":"Xbooru","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"Xbooru.com is a picture forum site that focuses on sharing perverted dirty porn and obscene content you can see various amateur pictures professional porn videos here as well as a huge adult anime content collection to watch your favorite cartoon characters get fucked or...","canonical":"https://theporndude.com/zh/2787/xbooru","affiliate_url":"https://xbooru.com/","rating":3,"siteOrder":22,"price":"free","tags":[],"features":["动漫"],"categories":[{"id":"hentai-porn-sites","collection":"categories_en"}],"screenshot_url":"https://cdn.staticstack.net/assets/img/r-thumbs/bb8503c-xbooru_small.png","image_alt":"Xbooru, adult anime porn site","scraped_at":"2025-10-28T19:39:45.649Z","iconSpritesheet":"custom-favicon-spritesheet.png","iconPosition":"-80px -272px","iconClassName":"ctm-icon2787","logoIconClass":"icon2787","pros":["free","tons of content, different varieties","regular updates"],"cons":["unusual layout","variation in quality"],"detailedDescription":"<p>Xbooru.com is a fucking mystery even to the kind of depraved motherfuckers who would associate with a guy like me. The site has been around for nearly a decade and has had 154,445,334 visitors so far, according to the counter on the front page. You’d never guess that looking from the outside, because it’s hard to tell exactly what the site is all about. Is it hentai, amateur pics, or something else?</p><p></p><p>Today, I’m going to try to straighten out the learning curve when it comes to Xbooru. If you’ve been trying to become one of their monthly 4 million views, but didn’t know what to start, read on.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Big Eyes, Big Tits, Big Tails</h3><p></p><p></p><p>The landing page features an anime babe in a skimpy Christmas outfit along the side, but I think that may be a seasonal ad for Nutaku. The art style does match the chick in the middle of the screen, though. This slut is naked and laying on some pillows. Upon closer inspection, she has cat ears, a flowing horse-like tail, some fucked-up feet, and no tits.</p><p></p><p>You hentai fans are into some weird shit, you know that? Hey, I ain’t judging you. You wouldn’t believe what I stroked off to this morning on the toilet. I’m just saying, don’t tell your grandma you want to marry or fuck a beast girl with a pretty face but a hideously deformed body.</p><p></p><p>Besides the word Xbooru on the furry whore’s thigh, none of the text is stylized at all. It’s not like there’s much of it, anyway.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>X Marks the Spot</h3><p></p><p></p><p>There’s a search bar, but I don’t know what to search for. Above it, links to Posts, Comments, Forum and My Account. I don’t have an account, so I’m down to 3 options. There’s some text that says they have nearly 700k posts, so maybe posts are Xbooru’s big deal. I click the link.</p><p></p><p>The whole site suddenly makes a lot more sense. This seems to be some kind of sex-themed imageboard. It might be utterly confusing to older wankers only used to free tubes, premium sites, and traditional forums. The younger deviates—I’m looking at you, /b/tards—will have no problem with this. Think of it like 4chan, but with a slightly different format and more focus on perversion.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Ass Posts, Teen Posts, Barefoot Posts</h3><p></p><p></p><p>(If you are looking for a live conversation with other freaks like you, check out Xbooru’s Discord. It’s called Rule34, which is the Internet rule that there are porn versions of all your favorite things. Nearly 20k members are signed up, and about 2.5k were online during my visit.)</p><p></p><p>If you’ve ever visited an imageboard or anything with “chan” in the domain, you know you’re in for a stripped-down experience. Xbooru’s layout is simple and almost ugly, but the grab-bag of dirty content will get you going in a hurry.</p><p></p><p>The Posts page has the Xbooru header, a sidebar full of category tags, a few hands, and a ton of pornographic images. I see row after row of giant titties, glistening cunts, and bitches grimacing from the sheer force of cock being thrust into them.</p><p></p><p>I assumed from the outside that this was a hentai site, but I’m not sure that’s how I’d describe Xbooru. I’d say half of the front page is anime bitches in different states of undress, which is way more hentai than a typical porn site, but there are plenty of photos. I see a few porn clips mixed in, but most of the collection is stills.</p><p></p><p>Clicking a thumbnail gets you a bigger image. The image pages don’t seem to have any info besides user comments. I was hoping to look at the dates to get a sense of how quickly the site is growing, but it’s just going to remain another of Xbooru’s enduring mysteries.</p><p></p><p>Whoever uploaded the most recent images gave me a good laugh. They’re fakes with celebrity faces superimposed on porno stills, and they’re very poorly done. You can always expect a wild range of variety on imageboards. Everybody gets to play, even if they can’t ball.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>One Girl Against the Wall, feat. Anus, Areola</h3><p></p><p></p><p>I clicked through the tags and watched the thumbnails flip around. I go in order starting at the top: 1girl, Against Wall, Anus, Areola, Ass, and then Backboob. I keep seeing the same anime slut bent against a wall, ass in the air. A photo of a degraded slut, writing on her face and mouth spread by a dental instrument, squats in a bathroom stall in another. The same nudie images of Marge Simpson, Lois Griffin, and Kim Possible pop up over and over.</p><p></p><p>It turns out the tags in the sidebar are the most recent tags used. It’s an alright feature, I guess, but I do think it would be more useful to show the most popular tags. Post volume on Xbooru does seem high enough that there’s always going to plenty of new shit to beat off to. New tags right now include Cum Explosion, From Behind, Anal Penetration, and Break a Booty Back.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Let’s Break a Booty Back</h3><p></p><p></p><p>There are 15 pics tagged with Break a Booty Back. Most feature rabbit people fucking. In each one, the female animal person has a gargantuan ass that dwarfs the rest of their body, the dude is smashing from behind, and there are geysers of semen blasting all over the place.</p><p></p><p>Breaking a Booty Back is an incredibly specific kink that I’ve never heard of, but that’s honestly one of the things I like about hentai sites. Xbooru isn’t strictly a hentai site, but their Tags list has some absolutely bizarre erotic imagery.</p><p></p><p>It turns out that ridiculous animal booty in something called Hyper_butt, and there’s also something called Butt_Expansion if you want to ease into the hugeness. At least a thousand images are also filed under Breast_Expansion. Tentacle fucking is represented, of course, and Suggestive_fluid just demands a visit.</p><p></p><p>The tags let you hone in on almost trivial details of the photos and drawings. Nerd porn sites tend to be great about that kind of thing, and this one is no exception. If you want a photo or drawing of a bitch Looking_at_viewer, you’ve got 43k images to choose from. There’s a little overlap, but not as bad as on some sites. For example, there are 209 Public_sex pics, 2553 Public ones, and 6788 Outside images.</p><p></p><p>Xbooru’s layout is going to turn off a huge percentage of the porn-viewing population, but it will appeal strongly to pervs who like video games, anime, and science fiction. This is nerd porn, through and through, with plenty of hentai mixed in. It’s not really that complicated once you dive in, and free is a great price for access to their growing stash.</p>"}},{"id":"7a1cef5b44dd","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"7a1cef5b44dd","title":"StudioFOW","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"StudioFOW.com uses the Origin Engine Movie Editor software to create very beautiful pornographic animation videos, and the protagonists in these videos are well-known characters, such as Laura.

I can't wait for their latest erotic game \"subverse\", but I'm sure many of you don't know who these fuckers are. Well, imagine you’re hours deep into playing Tomb Raider. You’ve been watching her ass bounce up and down for way too long now, but it’s fun so you keep playing. You run into a scene where you’re stuck on a deserted island. Suddenly some crazy assholes arrive and try to fuck Lara Croft.</p><p></p><p>But of course, she manages to get away. You get fucking pissed, cause watching her get assfucked by these fuckers sounds pretty damn fun. You’ve been staring at her ass for four hours now!</p><p></p><p>Well don’t worry, StudioFOW has the movie for you. It’s called “Lara In Trouble”.</p><p></p><p>Studio FOW is a porn production group that features 3D models from various video game franchises like Tomb Raider and World of Warcraft. The videos are all very high quality and feature great plots that tie into the game, hot ass bitches, and enough screen time that you can bust a nut (~15 minutes).</p><p></p><p>StudioFOW uses Source Filmmaker, a movie-maker based on the Source game engine from Valve. If you don’t know what Valve is, it’s basically the greatest game company in existence today, and StudioFOW shows us that Source Filmmaker can serve as a bitchin’ porn maker as well.</p><p></p><p>The same engine used to play Counterstrike also makes the best animation porn on the market? What CAN’T it do?</p><p></p><p>These productions are no fucking joke, and the quality stays consistent across all the movies. The first video was released in February 2014, featuring our big-tittied Lara Croft getting tied up and fucked by some crazy motherfuckers on a jungle island. There’s some good voice acting in the videos as well.</p><p></p><p>However, the quality of the videos also means they are made fucking slowly. You’ll only get a handful of movies a year.</p><p></p><p>It’s funny that there’s plenty of other pornmakers featuring these characters as well, but I guess StudioFOW does too good a job.</p><p>In general, StudioFOW is a great boutique studio passionate about letting you bust a big ass nut. From starting with two members, it now features nine employees and lots of voice actors to give you a AAA experience.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Passionate about making porn</h3><p></p><p></p><p>The website features upcoming films, past movies, a gallery of pics, team member bios, and a blog. When I checked out the site, there were three movies in progress, with two recently finished. Since these movies take so long to make, it’s good that StudioFOW has multiple projects going on at once.</p><p></p><p>Next is the movie section, where you can read about the twelve films released so far. You’ll get lots of information like release date, what video game it's from, and plot, as well as awesome teaser animations as you read it all. On the top right are the download links.</p><p></p><p>In terms of cost, through the miracle of crowdfunding, all the movies are free! You can download them from StudioFOW.com, or even watch them on other sites like XVideos.com. The studio is financed by donations, so no paywall or ad bullshit here.</p><p></p><p>The gallery is another awesome (and free) part of the website. This is where StudioFOW posts their mini-animations to keep their fans satisfied while they work on the big productions. Think of these as little Pixar shorts of porno, like appetizers to the main meal.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>A great but limited library</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Like I said, there are twelve high-quality videos to check out from StudioFOW. We got characters from Bioshock, Tomb Raider, Little Red Riding Whore, and more. The models are all created from the Source engine, making a 3D environment where StudioFOW directs all the scenes. The graphics hold up; this shit looks tighter than Red Riding Hood’s pussy.</p><p></p><p>The gallery is solid as well and features franchises like The Witcher, Resident Evil, and Mass Effect. You can bet your ass that most of these feature the hottest characters getting fucked. I’m pretty surprised the studio hasn’t been shut down, but no doubt this porn is great publicity when you think about it.</p><p></p><p>StudioFOW also keeps a blog, although for some fucking reason they use Tumblr as their platform. I didn’t bother reading it cause fuck Tumblr. That shit is beyond degenerate.</p><p></p><p>I also want to note that much of the content is hosted on other sites. Actually, I would even recommend watching it on a tube site or something. The feature films can be seen on XVideos and other places, while the smaller animations are hosted on Newgrounds or download services.</p><p></p><p>But if you want that deep satisfying sesh, then download the HD videos. It’s worth the storage space.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>What I Like</h3><p></p><p></p><p>The AAA titles are also well-represented. Overwatch, Witcher, Tomb Raider- these are big franchises. You know sometimes you’ll be playing a game, and a character will look hot and you’ll start searching for some Rule34? StudioFOW is the best answer in this situation.</p><p>StudioFOW also respects that extreme shit. There’s no softcore, acting pretty bullshit here; these bitches are getting fucked in the ass when they least suspect it, no Vaseline. The team is good at keeping the action fun and unpredictable.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>What I Hate</h3><p></p><p></p><p>I also read some complaints about the studio being too slow, which has been a drag for its donators and patreons. Since 2014, StudioFOW has only twelve big films to show. This is unique in the world of porn, where production usually means tons of quick content rather than quality.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Get the fuck off Tumblr</h3><p></p><p></p><p>They also may want to think about expanding their team. The studio releases shit too slowly to really justify regular donations or being a “patreon” (although they’ve been kicked out). The minis in the library make up for this somewhat though.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p></p><p></p><p>I like that the StudioFOW team are big fans of hentai, and the content really shows this. There is no shyness about showing extreme porn and all kinds of dark shit happening to these beloved characters. The scenes are classic hentai shit.</p><p></p><p>One interesting note is that Patreon shut down the StudioFOW account in November 2018. StudioFOW says that they saw this shit coming, so they stored up extra capital to keep moving on. They aren’t even accepting donations, instead of asking fans to “save their money right now and then help us push when we need it most.” It sounded like they have less than six months of funding, so hopefully, they pull through.</p><p></p><p>Anyway, StudioFOW is fucking dope. I can see why this place has a lot of supporters and people willing to fund their cause. This is some real professional-quality shit, and you can bet your dick that it’ll only get better. Once VR comes into the picture, it’s fucking over.</p>"}},{"id":"4ea1a172c127","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"4ea1a172c127","title":"GiantessBooru","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"Like Big Girl GiantessBooru.com is a huge collection of pictures about giant women.

The first time you visit this place, you might think that footfetishbooru.booru.org is a shitty site, but it is actually not as bad as their homepage. Obviously, this site offers loads of naughty content with the foot fetish, since why the fuck would the site have both ‘foot’ and ’fetish’ words inside the title if that was not what the fuck they had to offer.</p><p></p><p>However, one thing they kind of do not explain in their title is the fact that this place offers animated content, and by that, I just mean that they have loads of pictures instead of actual videos and all of that crap. Obviously, all the pictures will be drawings featuring the foot fetish, so keep that in mind while browsing this place, since if you came here to see some real action or real chicks, you’ve come to the wrong place.</p><p></p><p>Foot Fetish Booru homepage really does look crappy, as it has a black screen, with an ad or whatever the fuck that is, the number of total visitors and some options on top. You can either view the posts, comments, register or view the favorites. Obviously, the first thing I checked out were the posts.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Variety of naughty foot-fetish images</h3><p></p><p></p><p>The quality of the images is usually HD or solid, as this depends on the person who made the picture or uploaded it here. We all know that amateurs can be very fucking random, so one can never know what the fuck to expect from the images here. I have seen a huge variety, from anime content to 3D images or just simple drawings.</p><p></p><p>By now, you should know if this place is meant to satisfy your dirty desires or not, since I am sure that some of you might not find this content hot. Personally, I am not that into feet, but then again, I am not opposed to them. As long as the beauty in question is hot, I do not mind this crap, and since these are all drawn sluts, obviously 90% of them will be hot.</p><p></p><p>This also depends on your personal choices, since there is a chance that you might not find the anime chicks to be hot. Personally, I love hentai and all things anime, even the images, so I had loads of fun here, obviously. Simply put, everything is possible in the wonderful world of hentai, since it is all fake, so there is nothing that can be taboo or forbidden.</p><p></p><p>So, be prepared to see a lot of bizarre and fucked up shit, as well as the classics. For example, I ran into a lot of the usual images, where 18+ schoolgirls will pose and show their feet… I will just say that if you do not have a strong stomach, maybe you should not start with anime, or steer away from the weird crap.</p><p></p><p>It was obvious that weird crap would pop up from time to time, since these are mostly inspired by the Japanese people, and we all know that they offer the weirdest crap out there. I mean, if you watch hentai as much as I do, then you know exactly what the fuck I am talking about, as they really do offer a lot of random crap…</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Everything is free and most images are HD</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Take your sweet ass time and keep exploring, since the amount of content they offer is quite high. One could say that the thing that makes this shit so special is the fact that everything is different, but keep in mind that that also means that you might find some images that are drawn amateurly and they do not look good at all. So again, this all depends on your personal preference.</p><p></p><p>I do not mind when drawn content is not top notch, but I do mind when it does not make sense or it does not look presentable. I did find some content like that here, but I guess those are just beginner artists who will get better with practice. One thing that should have been implied is that there is a chance that if you have a favorite anime character, you will surely run into a foot-fetish image of her or even him.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Free registration, upload your own images</h3><p></p><p></p><p>It is very nice of them to give all of this content to us for free, and if you find a drawing that you really like, you can also view the artist behind that drawing. In some cases, people will just reupload already-existing images from other sites, such as deviantart.com, and they will credit the owner of the image on the side, which is again, quite fucking nice.</p><p></p><p>I am not used to all of this politeness… You do not even need to do much, just input your username, pass, and mail and that is about that. You might also be able to upload your own images without the account, I did not explore that part as much simply because you get everything free, so there is no need for me to make everything so detailed on such a simple fucking site.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Some search options and other good features</h3><p></p><p></p><p>But, excluding that and the search box on top, you do not really have any other types of search options, which kind of sucks. I say this simply because they offer a lot of different content, and with so much content it can be difficult to find what makes your cock hard since we are all different. This is especially true when talking about different pornographic content.</p><p></p><p>Well, there are some other site features that you might be interested in so I shall go over that briefly. First of all, you will have your own account where you can view all your crap, just like you can view what other users have posted. For some reason, you can list the content buy the comments, and I really do not fucking understand why would anyone do this?</p><p></p><p>They do offer a list of different tags, that really go in detail as to what the fuck you would want to see, and honestly, that page confused me. Basically, in the ‘Alias’ tab you will have a list of tags that you search for or other people search for, and a list of tags that should be shown… I know what Alias means, but I do not understand why the fuck was this necessary.</p><p></p><p>For all of you sad fucks who have something they do not understand about this place, you are more than welcome to visit their forum page, since you can do all of this shit for free. However, make sure to read their rules and all that crap, since you could get banned. I think we all know how the forum sites work, and if you do not know that, then you must have been living under a rock.</p><p></p><p>Overall, I had lots of fun browsing images on this site, but I would prefer if they offered better search options, instead of the shit they have offered. Basically, they have a lot of tags but no actual filters. Oh well, I can’t complain that much since 90% of the crap they offer on footfetishbooru.booru.org is completely free.</p>"}},{"id":"5351fb03a765","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"5351fb03a765","title":"HentaiFromHell","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"HentaiFromHell.comHentai from Hell is a website with a collection of many adult anime games and fan works.

I don't see any hellish ghosts on the page haunting it and terrorizing the cute babes that can be seen here. In fact, I do see a few, but those aren't anomalous, the animators put them in the purposely. All kinds of demons are found in here, damn. Some are tall, some are short, but they all have massive dicks that are just too much to take for these typically submissive (18+)girls.<br><br>I mean, MissAVDH kinda fits into that crowd as well, but I'm just curious if there are some dudes out there who actually instinctively want to be nice to their gals.<br><br>Anyway, let's not steer away from the main topic (like we usually do in the intro) and let's get back right into HentaiFromHell.org, a website that contains lots and lots of 2D animated filth. My first impression of this website is indeed a good one, seeing as the design is very simple and nice and that finding whatever it is that I like is going to be a piece of cake. Personally, I'm not really a fan of hentai, but if I do have to watch it, I guess I'll stick to vanilla stuff since hentai tends to get a bit too freaky for me most of the time.<br><br>I mean, I don't have to explain these things to you, but hentai babes are much freakier than regular chicks. First off, they have enormous breasts, they have huge thighs, and amazing asses. Not to mention that their pussies tend to be amazing, super wet, and the pussy lips are usually quite huge and soft, which isn't something you get with most girls in real life. Maybe you do, but I have to admit that I haven't run into a girl with tits and thighs as huge as the tits and thighs of a hentai girl, and honestly, I don't think I want to, either, seeing as those chicks usually have some special power or something like that.<br><br>Plenty of the girls here apparently can grow dicks for some reason? They usually use them on girls only, though. Furthermore, they do have a thing for fucking humanoid monsters, but they also stick to fucking tentacle monsters who don't resemble humans in any way, too. My human dick wouldn't do much for them, right? MissAVDH isn't a guy with low confidence, yet he is afraid of these chicks, now that's quite a surprise.<br><br>Anyway, the page also has a live chat, too. Furthermore, there are quite a few categories for you to choose from, but these aren't our typical categories. For example, most hentai websites have categories that aren't much like the categories in regular pornography, such as \"old bastard, \"breast inflation,\" and so on. However, HentaiFromHell, org does not have this kind of thing, which is surely a minus, but hell, we can work without this kind of option as well, can't we?<br><br>Anyway, let's get back to the main topic...so, as I said, there are no real categories HentaiFromHell, but rather, there are some \"improvised\" categories on this page. What we find underneath the big black letters that say \"categories\" are the following words: Archive, Complete Books, Complete Games, HentaiGames, Hentai OVAs, Images &amp; CGs, Japanese Games, Manga, and Doujinshi. Those aren't exactly the kind of categories you usually see on a hentai website, right? Indeed, they aren't, however, these can be quite useful on their own, even though they don't function in the same way regular categories do.<br><br>Now, I'd like to mention that there are little to no ads on this website and that the page doesn't hit you up with that annoying \"are you at least 18 years old\" screen, which is nice. Ads don't pop up on their own, and they don't pop up if you click on certain places of the page, which is quite nice.<br></p><h3>The info that HentaiFromHell.org gives you</h3><h3>Let's clear something up</h3><h3>The bottom line</h3><p></p>"}},{"id":"626d80895305","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"626d80895305","title":"WHentai","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"There are already a lot of pornographic pictures and countless adult anime pictures on WHentai.com, but if you become a member, you will be able to realize your fantasy and create your own commissioned pictures that satisfy your dirty desires...","canonical":"https://theporndude.com/zh/2834/whentai","affiliate_url":"https://whentai.com/","rating":4,"siteOrder":27,"price":"premium","tags":[],"features":["动漫"],"categories":[{"id":"hentai-porn-sites","collection":"categories_en"}],"screenshot_url":"https://cdn.staticstack.net/assets/img/r-thumbs/eef0c53-whentai_small.png","image_alt":"WHentai, adult anime porn site","scraped_at":"2025-10-28T19:40:15.889Z","iconSpritesheet":"custom-favicon-spritesheet.png","iconPosition":"-352px -272px","iconClassName":"ctm-icon2834","logoIconClass":"icon2834","pros":["some free art!","submit your own fantasy commission","become an artist, and get paid"],"cons":["some annoying ads","votes are not that cheap"],"detailedDescription":"<p>At first glance, you might think that WHentai is just like any other hentai-image website out there, but there is a lot you probably do not know. Do not worry, because I am an expert when it comes to hentai and manga, and I will explain all the necessary shit you need to know when it comes to this place.</p><p></p><p>Now the first thing I will mention is that whentai.com has created a game called Fap Titans, so check it out if you want, I could not have been bothered. The reason why I mentioned this first, before anything else, is simply because once you visit their homepage, that flashy annoying fucking Ad will play on the side in a loop, and believe me, it will bother the shit out of you.</p><p></p><p>The front page is filled with all kinds of kinky hentai images, and you might have realized that plenty of them are also blurred out. Once you click on those blurry images, you will be required to pay to view any of them, but the system is much better than you probably think. The images that are not blurred can be viewed for free; obviously.</p><p></p><p>If you plan to spend your time here, I suggest you create your account or log in with Twitter or Facebook, because there are some privileges you get as a member of the site. Now, the main focus of W HENTAI is to share all kinds of kinky hentai art from already existing anime, and the best thing about that is that you can participate both as a viewer and as an artist.</p><p></p><p>If you do not know how to draw and create HD pictures, like the one you can see on the homepage, you can always suggest kinky shit that other artists should draw. Of course, this will not be free, because those artists also need to make a living.</p><p></p><p>Basically what you should do is open the ‘Commissions’ tab, and there you can specify the description of the image, choose an artist you’d want to draw the image (this is optional), and then you will have to give the commission extra votes, just to show how serious you are. The extra votes you give will have to be paid for, and you can purchase them on your account.</p><p></p><p>As a new member, you will get discounts to the original prices, so you will be able to get 20 extra votes for $10, 100 extra votes for $30, 250 extra votes for $60 and 350 +100 bonus extra votes for $100. As much as I saw, you can only pay for this shit via PayPal, which is fucking stupid if you ask me...</p><p></p><p>I mean, what if I do not have PayPal? They could have added some other means of payment, since I am pretty sure not everyone has PayPal, but if you want to make commissions here or become an artist, well, you will have to create it.</p><p></p><p>The blurry shit I already talked about can be unlocked with the votes as well, so make sure to get the votes if you plan to spend your time here. Now, if any of this was too fucking confusing, do not worry, the site will explain everything again, so even the idiots and women will understand what the fuck I was talking about.</p><p></p><p>Those who consider themselves as an artist and think that they can draw this shit should probably check out the page ‘Become an artist’ as well. There you will learn all the shit you need to get started, and they also state that their artists can get about $2400/week, which is quite a lot. However, if this is true or not, I do not fucking know… not like I can actually draw to check the shit out, so maybe contact the other artists instead.</p><p></p><p>Everything you might be interested in if you want to become an artist will be explained on that page, so I will skip over that info because there is a lot that I’d have to mention. The only thing I will say is that you will have to draw 10 artworks and send them to the moderator before you get approved as an artist, which seems fair.</p><p></p><p>Keep in mind that as a member of the site, you can see what other people have requested, and you can add extra votes to their ideas as well. These votes are needed for the artists to actually draw anything. In addition, every member will have their profile, where you can view their latest updates and all that crap, and you can also send them a private message.</p><p></p><p>Other than that, you have a special section called ‘Blogs’ which is also very straightforward… this is the place all the talkative loners come to and discuss random shit, such as talking about stuff that nobody really cares about. The only reason why anybody should ever use this page is to ask something about or issues concerning the site.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, if you have any kinky request, or you always wanted to see your two favorite characters in a naughty scenario, I suggest you visit this site and make a commission. Personally, I could never fap to a picture, be it a hentai or a real image, because I need to see the bitch in action for my fellow to rise. But if you find this shit satisfying, then, by all means, explore what whentai.com has to offer!</p>"}},{"id":"7ed95cc5c9e3","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"7ed95cc5c9e3","title":"DeviantArt","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"DeviantArt.com is a social network for perverted artists and their fans which means this large amount of free adult anime to enjoy or share your own adult animation support artists","canonical":"https://theporndude.com/zh/9110/deviantart","affiliate_url":"https://www.deviantart.com/search?q=hentai","rating":4,"siteOrder":28,"price":"free","tags":["免费"],"features":["动漫"],"categories":[{"id":"hentai-porn-sites","collection":"categories_en"}],"screenshot_url":"https://cdn.staticstack.net/assets/img/r-thumbs/85c5b97-deviantart_small.png","image_alt":"DeviantArt, adult anime porn site","scraped_at":"2025-10-28T19:40:21.758Z","iconSpritesheet":"default","logoIconClass":"icon2177","pros":["art-oriented social network with lots of hentai","81k+ hentai deviations","a wide variety of hentai content","hentai straight from the source","artist subscriptions available"],"cons":["registration required, adult content filtered by default","no hardcore stuff"],"detailedDescription":"<p>Deviant Art is arguably one of the most popular hentai sites on the planet, though they don’t actually market themselves as such. The online art community has been around for decades now, and has always been welcoming to all kinds of artists, from photographers and videographers to the fursuit-wearing deviates drawing up all that X-rated anime you’ve been shaking your dick at. It’s only natural that an art-based social network with “Deviant” in the title would pick up a whole lot of beautifully deviant deviates along the way, along with all the twisted hentai they could come up with.</p><p></p><p>And that’s what I’m going to be focusing on today. There’s plenty of stuff to crank off to outside of the hentai parts of the site, but let’s face it, you’re here for the big-eyed girls with their tits out. <strong>As one of the biggest social networks for artists, DeviantArt.com has a ton of fucking hentai</strong>. The site gets well over a hundred million visitors a month, and I bet a lot of them are into the same kinky manga shit as you.</p><p></p><h3>Putting the Deviant in Deviant Art</h3><p></p><p></p><p>All this is to say that DeviantArt.com needs little introduction. If you really are brand new to it, no worries. All you really need to know is that it’s a community-based site for artists and fans, with all the usual social media features like sharing, liking, commenting, chatting and following. One of the biggest differences between this place and sites like Facebook or Instagram is just the content; those other sites feature real-life photos, while this place is full of drawings, paintings and CG renders.</p><p></p><p>Pull up the front page and you’ll see a mix of that artful content. Right now, I see rainbow-striped bears for pride month, maidens sitting in fields of flowers, and a surprisingly ominous vision of a futuristic bridge. There’s digital art and fan art, photography and fantasy all listed in a line of topics to explore. None of this is what I came for, though, nor the reason you’re reading this.</p><p></p><p>That’s why I typed “hentai” into the search bar. DeviantArt served me up 81.4K hentai deviations, which is what they call the artwork around here. If you follow my link or try to search the site yourself, you might end up with a smaller number and wonder just what the fuck is going on. DeviantArt.com doesn’t technically allow anything pornographic, and they hide a lot of the mature content behind a filter, which is itself hidden within the user settings. If you want access to all of the site’s hentai, as well as other grown-up material, you’ll need to register for a free account and then turn off the content filter by hand.</p><p></p><h3>Dirtier Than I Knew, Cleaner Than I’d Hoped</h3><p></p><p></p><p>That said, they’ve still got <strong>a wide, fantastic variety of anime-influenced adult art</strong>. Poking around a bit, I found that DeviantArt.com lists over 6,000 Deviants creating hentai, plus nearly 800 groups devoted to the topic. That’s a big pool of both creators and fans, which is naturally going to lead to a diverse stash of fapworthy original art.</p><p></p><p>Without refining my results, I see topless blue-haired bimbos, French maids with their boobs out, and cat-eared babes lifting their shirts. There are a few chicks being groped by tentacles, a couple tied up with ropes, and a fair share of lesbian anime interactions, some sweet and some sultry. Pregnant manga women are popular today, as are cow girls (not to be confused with cowgirls) being milked, big-hipped waifus and adorable yet sexy 18+ schoolgirls, as per usual.</p><p></p><p>There are some suggested tags listed at the top of the DeviantArt hentai search results, so I took a little tour. The hentai girls led me to ecchi hentai, which led me to oppai and then an aptly labeled NSFW section. Each time, the selection had thousands of images to gawk at and massage my dick to. I added some feet-licking drawings to my favorites, followed a couple artists doing thick anime girls (following is called watching on DeviantArt), and left a few comments under the images that made my dick the hardest.</p><p></p><p>One of the best features of DeviantArt is just the fact that it’s a social network. The likes, follows and comments wouldn’t have felt nearly so worthwhile otherwise. So many hentai libraries out there are just built out of content scraped from other sites, but here, you’re getting the artwork straight from the source. That comes with a lot of fun implications, like the ability to communicate directly with the artists, even if just to tell them you like their work. When you follow an artist, you’re more likely to get their newest shit here than some amateur hentai stash. The system also makes it easy to support your favorite artists through gifts, commissions, and their own art shops.</p><p></p><p>If you really want to spend some money, because you want to support the arts or just have access to more masturbatory material, you’ve got a few options here. A couple dozen Deviants are offering paid hentai subscriptions, and I hope to see more artists offering up their anime smut here. They start at just a buck a month, and many of the artists offer multiple tiers of memberships. Honestly, this could be a real moneymaker for DeviantArt and their Deviants if they could offer better perks than competitors like Patreon, so let’s keep our fingers crossed and our dicks hard.</p><p></p><h3>Holding Strong After All These Years</h3><p></p><p></p><p>At the end of the day, though, I’m glad I made the switch. The “real” hentai of Deviant Art is now at my disposal, and boobs usually make for easier fapping. The one downside is that the site is still pretty softcore by any modern pornographic standard, and definitely by the standards of most hentai sites. Even the NSFW version of DeviantArt looks like a fun family day at Disneyland compared to the absolute depravity you’ll find on any random site in my big list of Hentai Porn Sites here at MissAVDH. If you want the hard stuff, you may as well head back to the list now.</p><p></p><p><strong>DeviantArt.com’s biggest strength is its size and popularity as a platform</strong>. They may ban the hardcore stuff, but this is still one of the best places to find artists because there are so many active ones here. If I was drawing hentai, I’d definitely have an account here even if I had to post my favorite material on a less popular site. The folks who run the site could instantly make the whole thing a whole lot better by loosening up the rules on pornography, but until then, it remains a pretty solid community for hentai artists and their fans.</p>"}},{"id":"4fe738e08949","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"4fe738e08949","title":"Rule34.dev","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"Rule34.dev collects the best content of some of the most popular hentai picture sections such as Gelbooruehentai and e621 easy to browse XXX pictures in a wide range","canonical":"https://theporndude.com/zh/12239/rule34dev","affiliate_url":"https://rule34.dev/","rating":4,"siteOrder":29,"price":"free","tags":[],"features":[],"categories":[{"id":"hentai-porn-sites","collection":"categories_en"}],"screenshot_url":"https://cdn.staticstack.net/assets/img/r-thumbs/e1f83de-rule34dev_small.png","image_alt":"Rule34.dev, adult anime porn site","scraped_at":"2025-10-28T19:40:26.924Z","iconSpritesheet":"custom-favicon-spritesheet.png","iconPosition":"-464px -592px","iconClassName":"ctm-icon12239","logoIconClass":"icon12239","pros":["hentai imageboard aggregator","collects content from some of the most popular imageboards (gelbooru, e-hentai, yande, e621, etc)","a killer range of hentai and some more traditional porn","more accessible than your average imageboard"],"cons":["occasional bad search"],"detailedDescription":"<p>The very concept of Rule 34 is arguably one of the driving forces of the internet. At the very least, it’s a guiding principle that I see played out almost every day here at MissAVDH as I make my scholarly, masturbatory rounds around the web. As immortalized in a webcomic back in 2003 and reiterated on sources as respectable as Wikipedia, Rule 34 states “There is porn of it. No exceptions.” Sounds like good news for all us horny motherfuckers, huh?</p><p></p><p>When Rule34.dev slid into my DMs this morning, I was expecting another hentai parody library or imageboard full of X-rated Fortnite artwork. Turns out, it’s something a bit different and a lot rarer. <strong>The site is basically an aggregator of content from some of the more popular hentai imageboards out there</strong>. I liked the concept immediately, and I ain’t alone; their traffic has been growing rapidly over the last few months, and it looks like they’ll cross the million-visitor threshold this month. Let’s see what all these weebs and neckbeards are jerking off to, shall we?</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Rule 34 from Around the Web</h3><p></p><p></p><p>It wasn’t the imageboard I’d expected, but I immediately spotted references to some of the more popular platforms in the genre. The front-page spread of material hypes “The best of” from joints like Rule34.xxx, Gelbooru, e-hentai, e621 and Yande. They’re collecting fap fodder from some of the best imageboards on the internet. If you’re into hentai, you’ve probably visited at least some of them before.</p><p></p><p>You don’t need to be a fucking super genius to understand the appeal here. The interface alone will make it more appealing to normies who don’t wear fedoras, the kind of casual masturbators who are turned off by the usual Booru design. There’s also the matter of convenience: instead of visiting all those imageboards on the daily and flipping through the stacks in search of gold, Rule34.dev is gathering all the best stuff in a one-stop shop of hentai perversion.</p><p></p><p>You’re probably thinking about the implications already. By drawing material from a range of sources, <strong>they’re ensuring a nice range of X-rated anime content, plus some more traditional porn</strong>. E621, for example, is known for its furry fetish fun, and e-hentai’s got the adult manga, while Gelbooru takes a broader approach to hentai. Sites like Realbooru come through with the nudie photos and cock smoking GIFs, which means you’ll find them in abundance on Rule34.dev, too.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the front page right now, I see sexed-up variations of already fapworthy characters like Chun Li and D.Va, My Little Ponies with big jiggly asses, futanari rabbits, and pixel art succubi with their tits out. There’s CG anime porn, big-eyed 18+ schoolgirls in plaid skirts, elf-eared bimbos and a handful of real photos of buxom goth girls, Asian nymphettes and MILFs in fishnets and lingerie. Goddamn, I’m already horny as hell and I haven’t even started digging in yet.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Browsing Imageboards without the Bullshit</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Each of the Boorus listed on the front page comes with its own little panel of rotating imagery from the source. The Gelbooru panel, for example, offered up thumbnails leading to Rule34’s Gelbooru stash of Popular, Furry, Mature and POV images. Hit the refresh button and you get a new set of images and a new set of categories; in this case, they switched to Popular, Chubby, Tomboy and Furry.</p><p></p><p>You can also peruse The Best Of from some of the listed Boorus. I like how they offer a breakdown of the Best stuff over the Last Hour, Day, Week or Month. If you’re even remotely familiar with any of these sites, you know just how fast the fresh material can come in. Some of them have a basically non-stop flow of hentai being uploaded, and this gives fappers a really fucking simple way to skip to the stuff that’s easiest to jack off to.</p><p></p><p>I clicked my way to Rule34.dev’s Monthly stash from e-hentai. That brought up an 11-page grab bag of image sets, manga, doujinshi, artist and game CG, and a whole lot more. There’s hardcore bondage anime, Western-style porn comics offering their adult spins on Little Red Riding Hood, and some kinky foot fetish pics generated by machine with the help of some geeky pervert.</p><p></p><p>Then I went back to Rule 34’s front page, where the Yande panel now offered a quick link to their stash of hentai tagged with Thigh Highs. This one actually turned out to be a dud, with “No results found” when I clicked on it. It looks like the front-page subgenres might be randomly selected off a list regardless of what’s currently available. No worries, though, because a couple clicks later I was surfing through Chubby hentai pics from Donmai. You know what they say: the bigger the cushion, the sweeter the pushin’!</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Wanking Away the Afternoon to Hentai</h3><p></p><p></p><p>By default, Rule34 showed me Donmai’s Popular material, both 2D and 3D, with the 18+ box checked off so I’d have something to shake my dick at. With a click, I can whittle my selection down to the 2D pics. With another, I could narrow it to the Sensual or Safe pics, but why would a hardened masturbator like me do that? Give me the dirtiest stuff, please!</p><p></p><p>I switched the view from Popular to Recent. Rule34 instantly served up red-eyed devil girls, pink-haired lesbians, scanned doujinshi pages and Goku with a raging boner. Rule34 is dredging their sources constantly, so my whole first page selection was grabbed from Donmai within the last hour. The most recent pic, a Sailor Moon-looking babe with a bandage over her eye, was only added to Donmai a couple minutes ago.</p><p></p><p>One thing I’d like to see implemented on Rule 34 is a selection of the newest material across all the different Boorus, collected on one singular page. It’d be the kind of thing where you’d end up with a completely fresh set of pics every time you reloaded the page, but that’s a big part of the fun. If you’re the sort of compulsive masturbator who hits Refresh on the front page of any of these imageboards, I’m sure you understand the appeal immediately. The content comes in hard and fast, and sometimes we want to see it all.</p><p></p><p>Rule34 is still a young site, so I can’t imagine we’ve seen its final form yet. The concept is a definite winner, collecting material from a range of the most popular imageboards, and the polished, intuitive interface offers much easier access to the stuff than your typical Booru.

Wikipedia’s got an article about a Japanese train service, the fastest in the world, and the name translates to “Wish” or “Hope”. Before you get any wrong impressions, the site we’ll be looking at today ain’t a haven for railcar fetishists, but it might have all kinds of weird, kinky shit you’ve been wishing and hoping for.</p><p></p><p><strong>Nozomi.la is a massive, sprawling free library of hentai</strong>. The domain’s been around for the better part of a decade now, and they’ve been attracting a healthy volume of weebs, otaku neckbeards, general perverts and anime fans for years. They’ve been getting a steady three million visits a month, which says a lot on an internet so thoroughly saturated with masturbatory content. Let’s see what all these nerds are shaking their dicks, shall we?</p><p></p><h3>Who’s Up for Some Free Hentai?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>By the looks of the front page, I initially thought this was another hentai-oriented message board full of anonymous posters sharing their nudie manga creations and favorites from their personal stashes. Looking a little bit closer, I see it’s more of a straight-up gallery site. The presentation is similar to what you find on sites like Rule34 or FurAffinity, but you can’t leave comments or add images to the pile.</p><p></p><p>It's a low-key setup, for sure, but it does look nice. The grayscale header image and sidebar menu of tags just feel right alongside the spread of thumbnails taking up most of the page, giving off a vibe very much like flipping through a physical comic book. Other hentai sites could take a few lessons from whoever designed this joint.</p><p></p><p>As far as content, it manages to stick to the general manga theme while simultaneously being all over the fucking place. <strong>Nozomi.la offers a wide, weird and wonderful range of hentai imagery</strong>. The recent posts out front show off manga girls with big boobs and big eyes, sexed-up parodies of anime and video game characters, AI-generated hentai sluts and full pages of X-rated doujinshi scanned in for your literary and masturbatory convenience.</p><p></p><p>Since this is a hentai site and not your typical free tube, it gets a lot kinkier than the typical video sites out there. The artists here ain’t constrained by the usual budget considerations, nor the laws of nature. As much as I’d like to, I just don’t have the resources to shoot movies with fox-tailed furry girls, monster sex, crazy-ass inflated boobs or X-ray cumshots for my site, MissAVDHCasting. Nozomi, on the other hand, has featured these niches and fetishes among their recent uploads.</p><p></p><h3>Naked Anime Girls by the Millions</h3><p></p><p></p><p>I can, however, tell you how big the current collection is. As of this writing, Nozomi has collected over 22.5 million posts. Roughly speaking, I’d say about a quarter of those posts are galleries with multiple images, while the rest are one-offs with just a single pic to beat off to. However you’re counting, though, that’s still a hell of a lot of boner fuel to keep you all hard and drippy.</p><p></p><p>Given the massive depth of the collection, I do wish they offered more ways of digging through the pile. There’s a search bar at the top that’ll let you seek out your favorite artists, series or tags, as well as a short, ever-changing menu of popular tags along the edge of the screen. I couldn’t find a full list of tags, characters or series, which would go a long way in helping horny fans navigate this veritable wonderland of hentai perversion.</p><p></p><p>Right now, the popular tags out front lead viewers to selections of content labeled with R-18, Long Hair, High Res and 1 Girl. As a professional masturbator, it’s interesting to me how most of the tags listed out front are pretty fucking clean. Animal Ears, Smiles and Gloves ain’t inherently sexual, though a trip down any of these aisles offers plenty of fapworthy material.</p><p></p><h3>Filthy Adult Manga, Uncensored and Otherwise</h3><p></p><p></p><p>I switched to the Date-based view and was greeted by a similar spread of anime (18+) schoolgirls, tit-sucking lesbians, cat girls with fuzzy ears and fluffy tails, and big-bootied waifus spreading their pussy lips for the artist. “I want you to draw me like one of your French girls, but have me squirting gallons of milk from my nipples.”</p><p></p><p>A few of the recent posts on Nozomi.la are full hentai stories, with each scanned-in page stretching down in a long-scrolling gallery. I also found an in-depth tutorial on how to draw anime characters with the right proportions to get your readers horny as hell. Most of this content is in Japanese, but fortunately, I speak the universal language of naked girls and penetrated vaginas.</p><p></p><p>On the topic of impaled pussies, I was a little disappointed but not remotely surprised by how much of Nozomi’s content is censored. It’s a typical pitfall of not just hentai, but any kind of adult content officially released in Japan. The flip side to the equation is solid, though: <strong>most of the material here is uncensored hentai</strong>.</p><p></p><p>Unobscured cooters, poopers and dingdongs are the norm at Nozomi, so the Uncensored tag is a bit underused. About 387k pics and galleries carry the tag, but that’s only a fraction of the uncensored content. A quick look at the front page will prove that. They just don’t bother tagging it as such.</p><p></p><p>Fate Grand Order is really popular on the site right now, so I fell down the rabbit hole into their 3601-page library of related images. I’ve actually never played the mobile game, but I see the porno spinoffs all the time on hentai sites. I love how Nozomi’s archive takes the characters and tropes, then runs them all through the wringer of manga depravity. Honestly, I’d probably start playing the game for real if I thought it really had facial cumshots, tit wanks, hardcore femdom and furry fucking.</p><p></p><p>I clicked on a Fate Grand Order lesbian orgy pic and started following tags on the side of the page. That led me to Nozomi.la’s R-18 section, which led me to the Gravity Falls aisle, which led me to the Brother/Sister area and then along to the Incest category. A lot of the tags are listed in Japanese, though, which could potentially lead to some confusion or missed opportunities.</p><p></p><p>Still, I didn’t have any trouble keeping my dick hard. The only trouble I did have was typing up this review with my one free hand while constantly stroking myself and trying to avoid the weird stares from all the other Starbucks customers. It’s just another day in the life of the world-famous MissAVDH!</p><p></p><p>The enormous hentai library at Nozomi.la ain’t organized as well as I’d like, but it’s still a hell of a stash for fans of big-eyed manga girls, parodies, and assorted deep-niche fetishism. With my adblocker running, I didn’t see a single bit of spam during my visit, which only makes the collection even more appealing. It ain’t difficult to see how they’re getting millions of visits a month: it’s all that glorious, free, X-rated anime imagery.</p>"}},{"id":"a5df6e3aa143","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"a5df6e3aa143","title":"U18Chan","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"U18Chan.com is the perfect place to satisfy all your furry forum wishes.

I like to keep an open mind when it comes to porn, and the truth is, a lot of people come to the cum-stained gates of MissAVDH HQ seeking wisdom on where to find the best corners of the internet to enjoy the kind of smut they like in the best way possible. And, yes, that includes horny Furries.</p><p></p><p>What a minute, what the fuck are Furries? I hear you shout. Well, firstly, keep your damn voice down and think of my neighbors! Secondly, a Furry is best described as someone with a keen kink in porn art featuring animals with human characteristics, such as being able to talk, walk on their hind legs, and engage in BDSM and hard anal sex.</p><p></p><p>Furries tend to catch a lot of shit for their kink, and their conventions are often trolled by a broad spectrum of people. But even though they make the secretary at MissAVDH headquarters uncomfortable as fuck, I still spare some time in my sticky porn schedule to help guide them through the wild world of Furry porn.</p><p></p><p>Today, it’s a Furry day, and I want to delve deep into the basement of one of the Furry community’s most talked-about corners of the internet: U18chan.com - And, for the love of all that is holy, its URL isn’t what it sounds like! In fact, it’s based on a German submarine from WW1 called SM U-18, but I’ll explain why shortly!</p><p></p><p>I’d heard some good things about this site, but I wanted to do a deep dive and find out if it was true. So, will U18chan.com offer the Furry community more pleasure than a 21-year-old pornstar who likes to go anon at Furry conventions and suck dick in her gigantic fox mask? Or will it be worse than the backlash a British police force faced when they shared a Furry version of one of their officers drawn by a fan?</p><p></p><p>Let’s find out!</p><p></p><h3>What is U18chan.com?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Holy fuck, that is one immensely specific domain name. Anyway, what the hell is it? U18chan.com is an old-school-looking forum for the Furry community and is packed with a series of boards where people can enjoy Furry porn art, converse with each other about the subculture, meet new people, and all that jazz.</p><p></p><p>If you look on Wayback Machine and quickly search the U18chan.com URL, you’ll see that its history goes back to around 2010, making this a pretty well-established Furry porn community. Speaking of Furry porn, what kind of stuff can one find within its so-called ‘’basement?’’</p><p></p><h3>What’s the Furry Porn Like on U18chan.com?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>●&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Breaking Rose - Furry porn isn’t my thing, but I can appreciate some good porn art when I see it. The cover of this amateur Furry porn artist who scrapes a living from his work on Patreon shows a silhouetted fox girl having intersex with a hung human. In front of two shadows showing her on her knees and about to suck his dick is a bed covered in used condoms filled to the brim with cum and a pair of torn panties covered in foxy pussy juice. Damn, it looks like the night is just getting started!</p><p>●&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Archery Lessons - What a second, since when do dogs attend archery lessons? This cute-looking puppy clearly wanted to expand his hobbies outside of playing fetch and attended a private archery lesson from two hairy pitbulls. These buff and bearded instructors decide to send arrows up this pup’s quivering holes and end up relentlessly breeding him. Needless to say, he’s still shit at archery, but his farts no longer make a sound.</p><p>●&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Labrador Gangbanged by Rottweilers - Ever seen those videos where a dog owner leaves a camera in the house when they go to work? Well, if this incident were caught on camera, it would have traumatized the owners! Left home alone in a suburban house, this thick and busty female dog invites two rottweilers over for a gangbang while her cuckold labrador husband is being taken for a walk. She gets her shitpipe and pussy wrecked by these two rough and ready rottweilers until she’s simultaneously bred by both of them. Is this like the BBC gangbang of the Furry world?</p><p></p><h3>The Design of the Site</h3><p></p><p></p><p>The site is dominated by a large image and text logo at the very top that spells out the site’s name as well as the tagline, ‘’Being rammed by larger ships since 2014’’. To the left of the logo is a well-drawn piece of Furry art depicting an erotic black and white fox with a whip in its mouth and wearing a uniform that bears a striking resemblance to that of the SS in WW2. The main difference is that the ‘’Pawstika logo has replaced the Nazi armband’’.</p><p></p><p>At the very top of the site is a top bar menu that again features a ‘’Pawstika’’ logo followed by a main menu with various dropdown boxes. The menu is initially made up of five navigational links. It helps users find crucial site areas like furry comics, intersex material, moving images, gay content, and various Furry categories. On the other side of the menu is a series of buttons that allow you to change the style of the site’s appearance, activate night mode, and switch to Fap Mode, which reveals the site’s NSFW content in all of its glory.</p><p></p><p>Overall, the site is a forum-style community that closely resembles the likes of 4Chan in terms of layout and general aesthetic. It’s simple, to the point, and does the job it needs to do. The main aim seems to be conversing with other Furries and sharing relevant porn within the numerous threads dotted across the site.</p><p></p><h3>What I Like Most About it</h3><p></p><p></p><p>U18chan.com also doesn’t try to be something it’s not. This basic forum website caters to the furry community and aims to provide them with the kind of porn they’re seeking, and, together with the people who make up the community, it does a solid job of that.</p><p></p><p>As fucked up as many people will probably think it is, I can appreciate a well-designed logo, and the one U18chan.com is currently rocking is professionally made and looks sleek. Well, not if you survived WW2 only to see the infamous armband worn by high-ranking Nazis being modified into a ‘’Pawstika’’, that is.</p><p></p><p>It’s also a pretty cool feature that you can switch the site's color schemes. Not only does this add a whole new aesthetic to U18chan.com, but it’s also a lot easier on the eyes if you plan on consuming a lot of Furry porn for hours on end.</p><p></p><h3>What I Don’t Like</h3><p></p><p></p><h3>Suggestions I Have for U18chan.com</h3><p></p><p></p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Now, if you’ll excuse me, that’s enough Furry porn for the year. I’m off to go and watch some WW1 U-boats get the shit rammed out of them by the Royal Navy!</p>"}},{"id":"b672fdd637e1","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"b672fdd637e1","title":"FurryBooru","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"Furry.booru.org is a simple and straightforward website with a large number of carefully drawn artworks on it.

Yep, it’s that time of the month again; it’s time to talk about Furries! Look, Furries get a lot of hate on the internet for various reasons, but I’m MissAVDH, so I don’t judge if you want to dress up like a cartoon animal and, quite literally, fuck like rabbits!</p><p></p><p>But while it’s easy to write off Furries, it’s worth being open-minded about what they’re all about. But to do so, people often face a stumbling block about where to begin and what corners of the internet are the best places to find some decent Furry porn and get an idea of what it’s actually like outside of the memes that often make fun of the genre/lifestyle.</p><p></p><p>Sure, there’s no shortage of communities on Reddit. Still, there’s an equal number of independent spaces for Furries to gather online, share their favorite Furry porn, and discuss the various facets of the lifestyle amongst themselves.</p><p></p><p>Over the years, I’ve been on the frontline of many of these groups with the mission of shining a light on each and every one of them. Why? Well, I’m no Furry, but I do it for two reasons; firstly, I want to help people find the kind of Furry sites that will give them the best porn experience possible. Secondly, I equally want to assist them in avoiding the ones that will make them want to hang up their erotic fox costume forever and reconsider their lifestyle choices.</p><p></p><p>My mission to cover the world’s many Furry websites and forums is far from over, and today, it brings me face-to-face with a site called Furry.booru.org. This site is said to be one of the most underrated places for Furry artists to share their finest work and a hotbed of people in the Furry lifestyle to come and enjoy it, all for free!</p><p></p><p>But while gossip is one thing, I was keen to get balls-deep into this old-school-looking website to see what it really had to offer. So, will Furry.booru.org manage to impress me enough to make me recommend it to any dedicated Furry in earshot?</p><p></p><p>Or will I regret visiting it more than a fresh-faced newbie at a Furry convention who failed to realize there was a tear in the anus of his erotic bunny outfit and only realized his mistake when a Fedora-wearing man dressed as a fox decided to take advantage of it?</p><p></p><p>Let’s find out!</p><p></p><p></p><h3>What is the Furry.booru.org?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>As well as a heavily active database of Furry art, the site is also home to a relatively active forum with many exciting topics to explore. But, for the sake of this review, we will focus on the Furry porn that this website has on offer!</p><p></p><p></p><h3>What’s the Furry Porn like on Furry.booru.org?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Holy shit, that’s a lot of Furry content to get through! Few people have the time to explore a porn collection this big from top to bottom, nor do they have the ability not to bust a nut while doing so. Luckily, I do! To introduce you to the website's highlights, I decided to explore every last piece of Furry porn it had to offer!</p><p></p><p>● You can’t escape the wolf! - Damn, this guy’s asshole will never be the same after this! Tied to a chair with his legs behind his head and his asshole exposed, he’s being subjected to a brutal fisting session at the paws of a dominant wolf who has his foot pressed into the dude’s face to get the best momentum while wrecking his slave’s asshole. The detail in this Furry artwork is superb, from the sex-crazed look on the wolf’s face to the semi-erect cock of his slave that’s oozing pre-cum down his washboard abs.</p><p>●&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Tony the Tiger - This buff Tiger looks precisely like the mascot of Frosted Flakes. But this version of Tony doesn’t have his eye on cereal; he has his eye on the hungry holes of submissive Furries and wants to breed every last one in sight. The throbbing bulge bursting out of his pants shows he’s perpetually ready to gape open any willing holes put in front of them before adding some milk to their bowls and saying, ‘’they’reeeee great!’’</p><p>● Interracial kitties fucking hard - This ginger female cat with beautiful tits couldn’t wait for her husband to leave for work so she could invite the new black cat neighbor into their marital bed and indulge in some interracial feline sex. This artwork shows the pair indulging in a slow, sensual side fuck with her big, bouncy ginger titties hanging freely. Beautiful!</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Design of the Website</h3><p></p><p></p><p>The first page that greets you is a straightforward landing page consisting of a simple site logo spelling out the name of Furry.booru.org in easy-to-read blue text, followed by a search bar and a ticker that shows how many posts are currently active on the site.</p><p></p><p>This ticker is in two formats, a standard text version, and a kickass version, showing each number held up by a female Hentai character. Nice! This landing page also has a simplified version of the site’s menu consisting of four links that take you to the posts portfolio, comments, the forum, and a link to sign into a site account, if you have one.</p><p></p><p>When you click on one of these links, the site expands into the full version with a far more extensive menu starting with the post's portfolio. The site’s vast array of Furry art is displayed in two parts. The first is a sidebar that lets you filter content according to categories like felines and blue-haired Furries to seaside and swimwear-themed content. The second is your chosen Furry porn portfolio displayed in various thumbnails that expand when you click on them.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>What I Like Most About it</h3><p></p><p></p><p>This is also a great corner of the Furry world to discover new artists who are creating some epic Furry content for people to enjoy. Equally, it’s a solid place for said artists to gain more exposure to a broader audience, all for free!</p><p></p><p>There’s some really epic Furry porn on this website, too. Even if you’re not a dedicated fan of the lifestyle, there’s still some highly-talented artwork on offer, and it all loads in some of the best quality I’ve seen. However, navigating through it could be made better with some improved categorization, but I’ll cover that more in the next section.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>What I Don’t Like</h3><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Suggestions I Have for the Furry.booru.org</h3><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p></p>"}},{"id":"c00451bc1c54","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"c00451bc1c54","title":"PregChan","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"PregChan.com is an easy-to-understand website.

If you like to look at drawings of pregnant beauties, then I suggest you check out pregchan.com as soon as you can, since this site is filled with such content. The ‘chan’ in the name kind of gave it away that everything will be animated, and those who enjoy anime know what I am talking about.</p><p></p><p>As for the site’s overall design, it is quite basic, and it honestly reminds me of other similar websites that only offer anime images that I reviewed before. Well, here while not all of the images will feature a pregnant chick, most of them will, but there is more to the site than just the images you see. The old-school people, who remember how 4chan used to work and how it still functions, will easily find their way around on Preg Chan.</p><p></p><p>Some of the pictures will have a whole story presented on the side; for example, the first image I opened was of a chick from Inuyasha, and there was a very odd story written beside, and at the bottom, you had an option to choose how you want the story to continue. Of course, you are supposed to comment on the shit you are interested in, and eventually, you will get an answer.</p><p></p><p>When you scroll all the way down on the site, you will have the latest posts listed and all those will lead to sub-threads filled with appropriate shit. The name of the thread will be listed on top, and you should check that out before you start browsing. There was one section for those who want to chat, but it probably does not look like most of you expected it to.</p><p></p><p>There are loads of weird sections, drawings, and topics that I encountered… for example, there was one video where a chick was injected with something, and then she gave birth to an adult ‘her’ and then the two of them proceeded to give birth as well… quite fucking weird man.</p><p></p><p>But as I briefly mentioned, you have a lot of different content here, and not all of it is specifically dedicated to pregnant chicks. Sometimes, the babe in question has just devoured another person instead, and while that might sound weird to most of you, I am pretty sure that there are also some of you fuckers who actually fap to this shit.</p><p></p><p>I am not here to judge, everyone has their own dirty fetish, and if this happens to be yours, you are more than welcome to explore the content pregchan.com has to offer since all of their content is free. Currently, the site has a new admin, since the old version of the site was filled with spam posts, and well it did not look good at all.</p><p></p><p>The new admin, however, is doing a great job so far, as the site looks as clean as it did at the beginning. Obviously, I have a bunch of ideas as to how they could have improved their functions, but I will not be as harsh on pregchan.com as I am to other sites, since the new admin, Couchy, has stated that this site is still in development.</p><p></p><p>All the way on the left corner of the site you have some threads listed, and yes the threads are marked with a single letter and /, just like it is on 4chan. If you do not know what each letter stands for, then you should just explore it, or continue reading as I will go over every section they have to offer.</p><p></p><p>The first one I checked out is the B section, where you have random posts, meaning that you can see off-topic discussion and images. Since this site is dedicated to the pictures of pregnant animated sluts sometimes even the real babes, here you can post whatever the fuck you want.</p><p></p><p>The C section is obviously for the chat, and I have mentioned this previously. Here you do not have a live chat or something like that, but this section is meant to act as a forum where people can discuss different topics and talk to other members of the site.</p><p></p><p>If you are interested in the actual pregnant content, then you should visit the D section (yes, I am aware of how funny that sounds). D stands for drawn, and there you can find drawings done with pen, pencil, tablet, crayons and just with anything, I think every section is very straight-forward.</p><p></p><p>It seems like no matter which animated site I browse, there will always be a special section dedicated to furries and this place also has the same crap. I am not against people who love to dress up as animals and fuck each other but I am just stating the facts and I do think it is weird. Nevertheless, the F section is dedicated to furry lovers.</p><p></p><p>There are probably some of you who do not know what Oekaki means, which is the O section; Oekaki is basically an online board or place where people are able to draw with the java paint applet, and then share their opinions and allow their artwork to be critiqued.</p><p></p><p>Since this place is still under development, you might encounter some problems, and you should know that the site feedback is the Q section of the site. Those who came here for the actual real content, of real babes and pictures should visit the R section instead of other parts that are mostly filled with animated content.</p><p></p><p>As I have explained what every section means, there is no way for you not to find whatever the fuck you might be looking for. Overall, I enjoyed the content on pregchan.com, but some of it I just found fucking weird, especially in the R section of the site. But, if you find content like this to be hot, you are bound to have a jolly good time here.</p>"}},{"id":"e867e66518e6","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"e867e66518e6","title":"Rule 34 App","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"Rule 34 App is a progressive web app that provides you with all types of Rule 34 porn to check it out today!","canonical":"https://theporndude.com/zh/8760/rule34app","affiliate_url":"https://r34.app/","rating":4,"siteOrder":34,"price":"free","tags":[],"features":[],"categories":[{"id":"hentai-porn-sites","collection":"categories_en"}],"screenshot_url":"https://cdn.staticstack.net/assets/img/r-thumbs/44d99ab-rule34app_small.png","image_alt":"Rule 34 App, Adult Anime Porn Sites","scraped_at":"2025-10-28T19:40:58.602Z","iconSpritesheet":"custom-favicon-spritesheet.png","iconPosition":"-64px -528px","iconClassName":"ctm-icon8760","logoIconClass":"icon8760","pros":["porn for pretty much anything","hundreds of pages of porn","browse tags easily","all kinds of porn parodies"],"cons":["nothing"],"detailedDescription":"<p>Do you want to visit an app that has porn for pretty much, well, everything? If you have ever visited platforms like Reddit or platforms that institute Rule 34, then you already know what kind of porn that you can expect to find on a site that uses that rule. But for everyone else, it’s time to get a crash course as to what this kind of smut is really all about.</p><p></p><p>That brings me to Rule 34 App. This site – or rather, app (more on that later) – allows you to understand visually what Rule 34 really means. You will find all kinds of fucking porn that features illustrated content in most cases, demonstrating popular characters from all over get railed and jizzed on until your eyes bleed.</p><p></p><p>When it’s time to learn what Rule 34 is all about, this is where it happens. Visit Rule 34 App today. Preferably on your mobile device! Why? Well, allow my ass to explain!</p><p></p><h3>Progressive Web App, not a website</h3><p></p><p></p><p>So what is it? Rule 34 App is in fact a progressive Web app. What this means for you is only relevant if you want to browse Rule 34 App on your mobile device (which I’m sure you do). And although you can continue to look at Rule 34 App on your favorite Web browser if you wish to do so, for those that want to skip the Web browser and would rather use Rule 34 App like, well, an actual app, they make this easy as fuck.</p><p></p><p><strong>Rule 34 App is a progressive Web app you can install on your iOS or Android device</strong>. The site instructs users on how to add a progressive Web app to your mobile device in its FAQs. But if you have ever added a website from your Web browser to the desktop of your mobile device and have used it as a glorified app in the past, then you already know how to do this.</p><p></p><p>The only difference is that instead of clicking on the shortcut and watching the site immediately load on your browser, Rule 34 App is, once again, actually a progressive Web app. It just fucking browses differently and updates automatically every time you visit the site, just like a real app. In fact, I dare say that it is indistinguishable from a real-life app that you might find on your preferred app store.</p><p></p><p>Although you will never find Rule 34 App in your favorite app store, that does not change the fact that it navigates just as easily and swimmingly as if you downloaded it from an app. Hell, you know what mother fucker, let’s be technical here. This IS an app – you just can’t download it from a traditional app store.</p><p></p><p>That is fucking awesome if you ask me. And I know you want to know what I think since you are here on MissAVDH anyway. While it is easy to use Rule 34 App as a normal website, the preferred and easiest method is to navigate the site on your mobile device. Use it as an app, and you will see what I fucking mean!</p><p></p><h3>Porn for pretty much…everything</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Especially when it comes to porn parodies based on characters from film, television, anime, gaming, and more. All of the fucking series and characters that you love are all covered here. Want to look at pornography based on that stupid goddamn red panda that every Karen is getting upset about? You will find that here!</p><p></p><p>Want to get off to Elden Ring porn? It is here! Horny as hell to jerk off to One Piece porn parodied like the weeb that you are? Rule 34 App makes it happen. What about going old school and touching your tiny peacock to Teen Titans porn while you imagine Robin tossing your salad?</p><p></p><p>Do any of these things sound like a great time? What? You want to see pornos featuring all of the Star Wars characters gangbanging themselves? Was watching two droids scissor not good enough? Then come on in because you will find this shit as well!</p><p></p><p>In fact, Rule 34 App employs Rule 34 to near perfection. I found so many different types of parodies here that it would be impossible to list them all here. I am not even going to fucking try, so don’t even consider asking me bitch!</p><p></p><p>Just know that you will find a wide assortment of content that is sure to get you the fuck off. It is an insane assortment of content that depicts just about everything and everyone getting fucked in some way. I’m pretty sure there is probably even a set of images depicting refrigerators fucking one another.</p><p></p><h3>Hundreds of pages of porn illustrations</h3><p></p><p></p><p>I found that there is just so many different porn illustrations from all walks of life that it was fucking exhausting trying to look at all of them. Hell, I can tell you for sure that there is just no way in fuck that I am going to be able to fucking do that. But even though I know I cannot look at every fucking illustration here, even when I was trying my hardest it was proving to be impossible.</p><p></p><p>That is a fucking awesome sign for those of you that want to have access to so many different kinds of Rule 34 porn that your hand will fall off from jerking so much before you run out of content to jack it to. Which is goddamn awesome if you want to know my fucking opinion, and you goddamn do I know!</p><p></p><p>So take a look at everything that this unique site has to offer a mother fucker like you. Check it out, and I know that you will be pleased with what you find. Even if you are not and you are grossed out, hell, I don’t care! It is worth gawking at just for the laughs alone!</p><p></p><h3>Browse tags</h3><p></p><p></p><p>It looks like there is a wide array of tags that are used on Rule 34 App as well. I found all kinds of unique tags that are easy to click on and explore. Try out the tags that are featured on each listing, and see what kind of content awaits you as you browse all of the various tags on the progressive Web app!</p><p></p><p>It is an easy way to explore all of the tags that are available for you to browse on Rule 34 App. On top of all of that, Rule 34 App also allows you to subscribe to their premium service for only a few bucks a month. It allows you to create a collection of tags and even save posts. Take a look and see what kind of content you can get off to on Rule 34 App!</p><p></p><h3>Suggestions:</h3><p></p>"}},{"id":"c6b23a234b17","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"c6b23a234b17","title":"Kusowanka","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"Kusowanka.com is a new hentai image board that released millions of images and short videos in its first month with extensive adult content and XXX imitators","canonical":"https://theporndude.com/zh/11165/kusowanka","affiliate_url":"https://kusowanka.com/","rating":4,"siteOrder":35,"price":"free","tags":[],"features":[],"categories":[{"id":"hentai-porn-sites","collection":"categories_en"}],"screenshot_url":"https://cdn.staticstack.net/assets/img/r-thumbs/b801a58-kusowanka_small.png","image_alt":"Kusowanka, adult anime porn site","scraped_at":"2025-10-28T19:41:04.810Z","iconSpritesheet":"custom-favicon-spritesheet.png","iconPosition":"-0 -560px","iconClassName":"ctm-icon11165","logoIconClass":"icon11165","pros":["hentai imageboard","a nice variety of material","extensive xxx parodies of popular characters","3.5 million+ images and short videos"],"cons":["lots of sfw anime imagery"],"detailedDescription":"<p>After poking around Kusowanka for a while, I ran the title through Google Translate just to see what it literally meant. Given the subject matter of the site, I really expected it to be something in Japanese. If it is a Japanese word, Google doesn’t know it yet, because the translation I got back comes from the Nyanja language, spoken in a few African countries. In Malawi, Zambia and Mozambique, Kusowanka is another word for Absence.</p><p></p><p>You know, I’m guessing Google doesn’t quite know their shit, because what I found on Kusowanka.com is the opposite of absence. <strong>It's an imageboard with an absolute abundance of hentai</strong>, and they’re just getting started. The domain was just registered last month, and it’s pretty fucking crazy how big this stash has already grown. You weebs ready for a closer look? Let’s go!</p><p></p><h3>Kusowanking with Kusowanka</h3><p></p><p></p><p>If you’ve ever used an imageboard before, you already know this. There are countless Futabas, Boorus and Chans running on similar software, and I’ve reviewed a number of them here at MissAVDH. Even if you’ve never perused one yourself, you’ve probably heard of examples like 2chan, 4chan and 8chan.</p><p></p><p>Imageboards don’t waste much time getting to the point. Pull up the front page of Kusowanka.com and you’ll find the latest art to be uploaded. The bad news is that the focus ain’t strictly on NSFW content, so there’s a fair amount of wholesome imagery mixed in with the dirtier stuff. The latest pic is just some amateur manga art of a blonde chick wearing a hat and goggles. I’d say a third of the recent pics are totally wholesome and SFW, and another third are fine if your boss doesn’t mind big boobs as long as they’re covered.</p><p></p><p>The good news is that the final third is noticeably freakier. There’s a nice variety of hentai being posted here. Right before that SFW drawing of the goggles girl, somebody added a big-eyed babe getting her big jugs groped from behind. There are naked anime girls sunbathing, crazy-haired lesbians scissoring, furry rabbit folks getting fucked and cat women penetrated by multiple dildos.</p><p></p><p>Like any good hentai site, the artwork here is meticulously cataloged. The Tags section is a sprawling 713-page index of keywords like Perverted Girlfriend, Accidental Cunnilingus, Butt Witch, Hogwarts School Uniform and Upright Straddle. Truth be told, it's an unwieldy menu full of redundant tags and nonsense, but it does make the stash easier to dig into.</p><p></p><p>Kusowanka.com has some of the more popular tags listed in a sidebar menu on the front page, and I think they say a lot about the demographics playing with the site. I really wonder how many users are whacking off and how many are just manga fans, because most of the front-page tags ain’t even sexual. There are over 600,000 pics tagged with Multiple Girls and another half mill filed under Large Breasts, but tags like Solo, Long Hair and Blush all have over a million.</p><p></p><h3>Which Characters Do You Want to See Naked Today?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>The third major element that I think draws in the pervs is the abundance of parodies. Literally anybody can create doujinshi of their favorite characters doing freaky-ass shit they never did on TV, so a good adult manga library tends to have a ton of good parodies. Kusowanka is no exception, with a huge spread of famous characters in adult situations.</p><p></p><p>While not as deep as their Tags menu, Kusowanka’s Parodies section stretches on for over 200 pages. Remember, the site is just getting off the ground, so that number’s bound to explode by the time you read this. They’ve got parodies of manga, anime, video games, movies, and shit that I didn’t even expect. Literally the first parody I clicked on was based on the cover for Metallica’s …And Justice For All.</p><p></p><p>As with the rest of the site, however, not all of those parodies are explicit. The Metallica one wouldn’t get you written up at work or school, for example. I checked out the site’s collection of Mario parodies, which currently includes over 8,000 entries. I’d guess about a quarter of them are SFW, but fortunately they’re listed among some serious Super Mario filth. Ever want to see Princess Peach with rabbit ears and a gaping butthole dripping sperm?</p><p></p><p>You can also browse the Characters menu if that’s easier for you, but I’ve got to warn you, the menu is already over 800 pages. They’ve got SFW and NSFW artwork of everyone from Hatsune Miku to Princess Zelda to the fucking villagers from Animal Crossing. Their Chun Li collection contains over 5,000 pics of the big-thighed, high-kicking, street-fighting babe, and it's taking all my willpower to continue this review instead of taking an extended fap break.</p><p></p><h3>Hentai Pics by the Millions</h3><p></p><p></p><p>I almost missed the videos at first, because the thumbnails are mixed in with the rest. Occasionally, though, you’ll see a Play button and know you’ve struck moving-picture gold. The first one I found was an Asian girl shopping with a remote-controlled vibrator in her pants. The cameraman’s got the remote, making it an entertaining 30 seconds. Now I need to hunt down the full thing!</p><p></p><p>I had to poke around for a minute to find it the Video section, which is listed in the Metadatas menu. The navigation’s a little clunky and I wish they had a more convenient link listed out front, but once you find the spot, there are over 11,000 videos listed. I’d say it’s a roughly 50/50 split between animated hentai and JAV, with a few CG animations and Western-style cartoons here and there for good measure. Likewise, they’ve also got an Animated GIF collection with nearly 70,000 moving images.</p><p></p><p>Given the newness of the site and the sheer size of the library, I really expected to see fresh content every time I refreshed the front page. On a lot of imageboards, this is one of the easiest ways to browse thanks to the non-stop influx of new posts. Strangely, it doesn’t look like Kusowanka has been updated at all in the time I’ve spent whipping up this review. Either they’re doing batch uploads and I’m in between drops, or they’ve had some kind of temporary interruption.</p><p></p><p>Whatever the case, I’m looking forward to seeing how Kusowanka.com continues to grow. If the collection is this extensive and this varied within the first couple months of being online, it suggests even more impressive things for the future. Any way you slice it, 3.5 million images is one hell of a stash, with enough diversity to keep even the most depraved deep-niche fetishists happy. Whether you’re just looking for some fan art based on One-Punch Man or want to jack off to gender-swapped Pokemon bukkake, there’s a good chance you can find it here.</p>"}},{"id":"03697adbacf8","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"03697adbacf8","title":"ScrollX","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"ScrollX.org is a smooth-run platform that provides you with a selection of hardcore porn from Reddit's dirty corners and allows you to browse at high speed","canonical":"https://theporndude.com/zh/21246/scrollx","affiliate_url":"https://scrollx.org/","rating":4,"siteOrder":36,"price":"free","tags":[],"features":[],"categories":[{"id":"hentai-porn-sites","collection":"categories_en"}],"screenshot_url":"https://cdn.staticstack.net/assets/img/r-thumbs/1c74a_scrollx_small.jpg","image_alt":"ScrollX, adult anime porn site","scraped_at":"2025-10-28T19:41:10.350Z","iconSpritesheet":"custom-favicon-spritesheet.png","iconPosition":"-288px -912px","iconClassName":"ctm-icon21246","logoIconClass":"icon21246","pros":["an excellent way to consume a vivid range of reddit porn in one convenient space","it's super easy to scroll through, thanks to xxx videos kicking into action automatically","the site does a fine job of crediting the original content creators and the subreddits"],"cons":["the only element missing from the size at the moment is a well-written about page"],"detailedDescription":"<p>Scroll X!

However, it's safe to say that navigating through the porn on Reddit at high speed isn't always as flawless as you'd like.</p><p></p><p>Sifting through subreddit after subreddit can be tiring as fuck. It's the kind of feeling that leaves you wishing for a naughty way to scroll through your porn at high speed in the same way you can make your way through content on the likes of TikTok and Instagram, right? Well, I have some good news for you because there's a growing number of XXX platforms out there that are specializing in precisely that naughty format!</p><p></p><p>Well, it's almost good news all around because while there are plenty of platforms that do a damn fine job of delivering porn in this rapid-fire format that we all know and love, there are also plenty of them out with that will seriously let you down. I'm here, though, to ensure you get your hands on the first kind of sites while avoiding the latter. And today, I'm gonna see what kind of high-speed smut Scrollx.org can bring our way.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>What is Scrollx.org?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>As well as some of the most classic porn genres to be found on Reddit itself, such as anal, amateur, fetish, Asian, and Rule 34, you can also cut straight to the chase and see some of the top male, female, and transsexual content creators currently strutting their stuff on the NSFW corners of Reddit.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>What’s the Scrollable Reddit Porn Like on Scrollx.org?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>1. This Bitch Looks Like a Fuckin’ Sex Doll! - This first post is a video uploaded to Reddit that genuinely has to be seen to be believed. It's a POV porno that sees some big dick white guy slamming every last inch of his quivering fuck rod deep into the perfectly shaved pussy of a woman whose body genuinely looks like a fuckin’ sex doll. She has some of the hottest and perfectly shaped all-natural tits you've ever seen, and they roll around on her chest from the force of the fucking beautifully. It's almost borderline hypnotic. As if it couldn't get any better, the soundtrack is like music to your horny ears because she has some of the hottest sexual moans you've ever heard.</p><p>2. Does the Carpet Match the Drapes? - If you've kept your ear close to the ground in the world of sex, then you'll know that natural redheads often have a vicious reputation for being sexually aggressive in the bedroom. And this picture posted to Scrollx.org is an immense snap that shows us a 19-year-old ginger chick who is not only packing some of the most incredible natural tits you've ever seen, but she's also showing off a meaty pussy that comes complete with a bright orange pubic bush the laws you in like a horny moth to a sexual flame. She's even posing with her virgin white panties draped over her smooth thighs, and you can see a massive damp patch on them as a result of them clinging to the outer walls of her perfect pussy for so damn long.</p><p>3. Go In Face First Like a Gentleman! - Any man who knows his way around the bedroom well enough will know that it's rude to push your dick in a woman's pussy unless you licked her out for at least half an hour beforehand, and this smoking hot 19-year-old brunette is well aware of the code of conduct required in the bedroom. Laying on her told me in a pair of black high heels that have her fittingly black panties hanging off them in one of the most seductive ways you can imagine; we see her lifting her ass cheeks to the side to show you her dripping work pussy and looking back at you over a shoulder with one of the most perverted smiles on her face as she goads you into sliding between her legs face first to earn the right to fuck her brains out.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>The Design of the Site</h3><p></p><p></p><p>After this, the real magic begins as you’re thrown into the collage of content from across Reddit itself. If it's a photo collection, you'll see a scrollable number of images in the lower corner. If, on the other hand, it's a video, you'll see a play button and the volume mute button in the lower corners of the content. Hovering over the video contents kicks it into action automatically, so be careful if your device isn't muted while you're watching in public.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>What I Like Most About it</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Another cool thing about Scrollx.org is the lack of interaction needed to explore the content. All you need to do is scroll and hover, and you'll be fed with as much porn as you can handle. You barely need to click anything or put any effort into getting showered with a glorious array of smut, and that’s just wonderful!</p><p></p><p>And I'd really hate it if a platform like this just pulled content from Reddit and didn't give credit to the original people who published it. Thankfully, this is something Scrollx.org does a damn fine job of avoiding, and each post shows you the name of the original user who uploaded it to Reddit on the subreddit they initially posted it in.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>What I Don’t Like</h3><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Suggestions I Have for Scrollx.org</h3><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p></p>"}},{"id":"5054ed6d3eda","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"5054ed6d3eda","title":"Reddit Hentai","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"rHentai is a Reddit sub-site with 70,000 readers, you guessed that the website focused on sharing some of the different regulations and requirements set by pornographic anime websites about uploading content so that this place can only share ordinary X-level comics but if you...","canonical":"https://theporndude.com/zh/112/hentai","affiliate_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/hentai/","rating":4,"siteOrder":37,"price":"free","tags":[],"features":["动漫"],"categories":[{"id":"hentai-porn-sites","collection":"categories_en"},{"id":"best-nsfw-reddit-sites","collection":"categories_en"}],"screenshot_url":"https://cdn.staticstack.net/assets/img/r-thumbs/3709304-hentai_small.png","image_alt":"Reddit Hentai, adult anime porn site","scraped_at":"2025-10-28T19:41:16.096Z","iconSpritesheet":"favicon-spritesheet.png","iconPosition":"-336px -32px","iconClassName":"icon112","logoIconClass":"icon1","pros":["quality subreddit with lots of content","active community with frequent posts","good level of moderation","hd pictures, videos, and gifs of hot hentai babes"],"cons":["nothing"],"detailedDescription":"<p>Reddit Hentai, aka r/Hentai! What is it with those fucks who use Reddit all the time slipping that shit into conversation every chance they get? I’ll be trying to have a normal ass conversation about big tittied sluts and they’ll have to list of a baker’s dozen of subreddits that loosely related to everything I just talked about. And don’t even get me started on the fucking lingo that everyone uses on there. “Thanks for the gold, kind stranger,” “play stupid games win stupid prizes,” and all of the other bullshit phrases that everyone spews out every chance they get as if they were the person to come up with it. I fucking hate it. That being said, I use Reddit all the time.</p><p></p><p>What can I say? You try and spy on the enemy long enough and eventually you become the enemy. Reddit is great resource for fapping to amateur babes and hentai sluts as well, so you know I have to be on top of that shit. I won’t be covering the amateur babe selection this time around, but you should definitely check out some of the other subreddits I’ve reviewed if that sounds up your alley. What I want to talk about is the r/hentai subreddit. This sub is a treasure trove full of only the best hentai pictures, GIFs, and WEBMs.</p><p></p><p>Oh, and I know some of you dumb fucks out there are probably going “hurr, durr, what is a Reddit?” Well, let me educate your ass. Reddit.com is a site geared around communities called “subreddits.” Each sub has a specific topic that it is geared around. There are plenty on here for SFW shit, but we’re not here for that! I’m talking porn. They have so much fucking porn on this site with hundreds of subreddits dedicated to certain fetishes. If you have any fetish, and I mean anything, then you’ll be able to find a community for it no matter how sick it is. If not, then you can make your own subreddit and get recruiting.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Nearly 600 Thousand Members Strong!</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Each subreddit tends to have a slightly different setup and moderation style, so let’s dive into that good shit before we get into the content. r/hentai is part of a group they call “The Hentai Group.” It’s basically a bunch of hentai subreddits that help each other out. There’s a tab up top with some of the other subreddits in the group if you feel like getting even more sexy hentai content.</p><p></p><p>You can also join their Discord server, which has thousands of cucks on it talking about hot hentai babes at all hours of the day. Then there’s a hentai directory you can find over on the right side collum of the page. That thing lists every single hentai subreddit on Reddit. It even tells you how many subscribers each one has and gives a little blurb about what it’s all about. Fuck yeah.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Don’t Repost or Post Illegal Shit and You’ll Be Good to Go</h3><p></p><p></p><p>It’s got the same basic options for sorting through content as most other subreddits do like “hot,” “new,” and “top.” But, honestly, you could always go by “hot” and probably never run out of content. It’s fucking incredible. There are new uploads every few minutes here. You can scroll, and scroll, and scroll while jerking your dick to hundreds of hot pictures and short videos of slutty hentai babes spreading their pussies and getting their holes spread just for you.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Free HD Pictures, GIFs, and WEBMs of Hot Hentai Babes</h3><p></p><p></p><p>You can load up images in their full quality, play videos without buffering, and leave a comment to your fellow horny Redditors if you feel like you need to. And since this site has been around since 2008 the odds are that you’ll find just about anything you’re looking for. Just plug whatever shit you want to fap to into the subreddit search bar and you’ll probably get a fuck ton of results.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Quality Mobile App for Taking Your Hentai Sluts On the Go</h3><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>MissAVDH’s Favorite Features</h3><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>MissAVDH’s Suggestions</h3><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>MissAVDH’s Final Thoughts</h3><p></p>"}},{"id":"7809b3cdd8f3","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"7809b3cdd8f3","title":"Reddit Rule 34","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"Reddit.comrrule34 is a place that provides high quality rules 34 content This is a cool place This place is very well regulated you won't see some random junk pictures here everything has a source and author name etc...","canonical":"https://theporndude.com/zh/141/rule34","affiliate_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/rule34/","rating":5,"siteOrder":38,"price":"free","tags":[],"features":[],"categories":[{"id":"hentai-porn-sites","collection":"categories_en"},{"id":"cartoon-porn-sites","collection":"categories_en"},{"id":"best-nsfw-reddit-sites","collection":"categories_en"}],"screenshot_url":"https://cdn.staticstack.net/assets/img/r-thumbs/75464e0-rule34_small.png","image_alt":"Reddit Rule 34, adult anime porn site","scraped_at":"2025-10-28T19:41:22.225Z","iconSpritesheet":"favicon-spritesheet.png","iconPosition":"-160px -48px","iconClassName":"icon141","logoIconClass":"icon1","pros":["pictures and animations of hot r34 porn","very frequent uploads","quality posts with active moderation","it’s on reddit!"],"cons":["nothing"],"detailedDescription":"<p>Reddit Rule 34, aka Reddit R34, aka r/Rule34!

People go wild with r34 and make crazy shit of weird objects getting fucked by other weird things, but that’s not the classic r34. I’m talking more about your favorite characters from anime, cartoons, comics, books, and movies bending over and getting fucked.</p><p></p><p>I’ve got just the place for you to settle down, whip your dick out, and start fapping to glorious r34 content. And that place is Reddit. That’s right, we’re diving back into yet another NSFW subreddit. I fucking love these. Being able to flip between my favorite porn subs all in one place makes for a great fap. And r/rule34 is right up my alley. It’s full of drawn and animated porn of the hottest waifus and babes on the internet.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Reddit: A Quick Rundown</h3><p></p><p></p><p>And there are all kinds of different pages for your fetish fanatics. BDSM subs, kinky voyeur subs, and tons more. You can check out my other reviews for info about those treasure troves. If you like a post that you see then you can upvote it to give that user some karma, which are basically brownie points that show off how popular you are. And the opposite is also true. Smash that downvote button if the post sucks. And that’s the bare bones of Reddit. Hop on over and give it a shot if you haven’t. You’ll have a feed full of porn subs in no time at all.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Quality Moderation Ensures Quality Posts Without Bullshit</h3><p></p><p></p><p>No, your mary sue fuck toy OC character that all of your friends love doesn’t fucking count. Nobody cares that she has the superpower of taking 12 dicks at once. It has to be r34 of actually popular characters that people would likely recognize.</p><p></p><p>One unique rule to the sub is that your first post to the sub has to be a piece of r34. That may seem obvious. Like, fucking duh you have to post r34 on an r34 sub. But this sub also takes request posts for the source of images and shit like that. Once you contribute an r34 post, then you’ll be allowed to make requests and all of that jazz.</p><p></p><p>If you’re not sure if something counts as r34 or if the content is questionable, then message the fucking mods. I don’t want to see your pathetic ass on r/loligotbannedforthis complaining about dumbass mods not appreciating your simulated furry torture porn. There’s a handy list of mods right below the rules. Ask them and avoid a ban. It’s that fucking easy.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Active Community With Frequent Uploads</h3><p></p><p></p><p>You can organize content by all the standard Reddit options like “New, Controversial, Rising, Top, and Hot.” One thing is certain, all of the posts are pretty damn hot. I mean, fuck. They have some quality r34, and the upload frequency is insane.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Porn of All the Hottest Babes and Waifus</h3><p></p><p></p><p>As with every other subreddit, you can share posts, save them for later fapping, download them to your spank bank, or comment some cringy shit about how you love Starfire’s perky tits. I’d say that most of the porn here is pictures. You get a few scattered SFM animations or cartoon style clips every once in a while, but you’ll mostly be fapping to jaw-droppingly sexy pictures of your favorite anime bitches.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Browse Hot Pics of Busty Babes Using the Reddit Mobile App</h3><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>MissAVDH’s Favorite Features</h3><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>MissAVDH’s Suggestions</h3><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>MissAVDH’s Final Thoughts</h3><p></p>"}}]

They say some things never go out of style. Martinis, red lipstick, and lace underwear have all made the list, but usually, it will vary wildly depending on who you ask. One thing that everyone can agree on, though, is vintage porno. That type of sexual gold is exactly what’s on the menu over at The Classic Porn.</p><p></p><p>Even in these futuristic times of interactive sex video games and VR hump helmets, perverts keep coming back to the classics. TheClassicPorn.com has been peddling their wares since 2006, which tells you that people love what they’re putting out there. What’s truly amazing is that their catalog actually goes all the way back to the 1960s. Their newest offerings, from the ‘90s, are already decades old.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Beating Off Through the Ages</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Today’s Most Popular DVD and Films are lined up in a row at the top of the screen, just like you’re looking at a shelf at the rental place. Remember those back rooms at the otherwise family-friendly video stores? The only thing missing from TheClassicPorn’s entrance are those swinging saloon doors.</p><p></p><p>What’s popular today? I’m glad you asked. There’s a <a href=\"https://MissAVDH.com/blog/enjoy-some-terrific-legendary-butt-hacks-with-the-best-of-anal-vintage-porn-scenes/\" target=\"_blank\">vintage anal sex movie</a> (1995) called Ass Action, 1990’s Hidden Desire filed under the category Facial, and a Rocco Siffredi flick from 1994 called Tarzan-X: Shame of Jane.</p><p></p><p>If the ‘90s weren’t your favorite porn era, no worries. Other flicks on Today’s popular list include Intikam Kadini, a Turkish classic from 1979, and a porno comedy called Swinging Wives, originally released all the way back in 1971.</p><p></p><p>The trailers are available without signing up and logging in, so I checked out the one for Swinging Wives. The trailer seems to be a DIY affair, somebody speeding through the entire movie and stopping from time to time to give us a quick taste. The big hair and polka dots are ridiculous, the colors are ‘60s loud and the film is grainy, but there are some sexy, classic beauties on display here. I think it’s time for a closer look.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Way Cheaper Than an ‘87 DeLorean</h3><p></p><p></p><p>The last figure in the banner breaks the membership down at $0.83 a day, or a sixth of the cost of a Big Mac. That number’s not accurate. Regular price is about $35 a month, so about $10 more than that. The longer memberships actually break down to 66.6 cents a day, so make devil horns when you’re gripping your cock to this vintage porno. During my visit, I also found a limited offer for a month at $8.32.</p><p></p><p>It’s worth noting that a regular monthly subscription to TheClassicPorn is just slightly more than the standard $30 every other porn site is offering. The sign-up page says they only have Quality Classic Porn and Only Exciting Plots, so maybe that’s part of the appeal.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Classic Beauties in Classic Pornos</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Click through to a pornstar’s profile and you’ll find a full bio with much more information. It’s a pretty standard feature of a decent porn site, so it’s easy to miss the effort that’s gone into this. Info on porn sluts is a lot easier to come by in this modern era, especially if you just filmed one. Somebody at TheClassicPorn had to do actual research to dig up what you’ll find here.</p><p></p><p>I made my way to the first page of female pornstars, where I found a Who’s Who of the industry’s most beloved classic beauties. Anette Haven, Hyapathia Lee, Desiree Cousteau, and Asia Carrera all grace the top the screen, generally with their big porno tits out.</p><p></p><p>Each of these goddess-level sluts is a true legends. They’ve all been in a ton of movies. PJ Sparxx: 248. Madison: 194. Domonique Simone: 274. The numbers are kind of wonky, because when you click through you’ll find a full list of the films they’ve been in with ones available on the site highlighted in blue. Neither number seems to match the one out front. I’d care more if TheClassicPorn had fewer films on the site, but each girl has a thick catalog here.</p><p></p><p>The top chick on the whole site is Brigitte Lahaie. Born in 1955, the French whore banged out porno movies from 1977 to 1998, starring in a whopping… one movie? That can’t be right. Let me just click this number.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Digging Into All These Vintage Porno Movies</h3><p></p><p></p><p>One of the issues I noticed earlier about TheClassicPorn is that the tags aren’t that great. It’s old-school because you sometimes have to read the synopsis or look at the pics just to find out what kind of action you’re in for, but I don’t think it’s intentional. I imagine it comes with the territory of digitizing thousands of old movies; tagging them means somebody has to watch them all in their entirety and catalog the depravity.</p><p></p><p>The lack of tags shows up on the Filmography pages, where you largely have to go by the film titles. Half of Brigitte’s aren’t even in English. Only a few have tags, so I make my way to the one with Anal, Facial, and DP. It’s a 1979 sex movie from Caballero Classics called Serviced with a Smile.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>The Hottest Whores Who Ever Lived</h3><p></p><p></p><p>The flick is broken up into 8 parts, which I didn’t really like because it makes it harder to find specific things I’m looking for. I wanted to skip to that anal and DP, but I can’t say I was disappointed watching her ride one dude while stroking two other cocks. I’m not sure why they break the movies up, but I assume it’s yet another quirk of digitizing older flicks.</p><p></p><p>While their tagging of specific sex acts per film may be sub-par for a modern porn site, I love how deep you can dig into porno history in each info section. DVD rips and VHS dubs on TheClassicPorn have a ton of meta-data, including not just co-stars and categories, but directors as well. Click on a name and get much, much more.</p><p></p><p>The well-researched and well-documented history of smut is just one of TheClassicPorn’s selling points. Obviously, the biggest seller is going to be their ludicrously huge stash of vintage and classic pornography.</p><p></p><p>Most sex movies recorded before the digital era are long gone, never to be seen again. The ones that remain have been cherished by perverts, dubbed and passed along and saved because they’re just too fucking hot to let go. TheClassicPorn offers fuck flicks that have been getting people off since before you were born. There’s a damn good reason Classic is in the name.</p>"}},{"id":"ab16e7d86534","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"ab16e7d86534","title":"FapHouse Vintage","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"FapHouse.com has a lot of completely exclusive porn content for only 9.99 euros and you can enjoy content you can't find anywhere else browse its exclusive retro porn content themes here are hot group sex parties and retro porn content travel time back to actresses...","canonical":"https://theporndude.com/zh/9352/faphousevintage","affiliate_url":"https://faphouse.com/c/vintage/videos?slug=vintage&utm_campaign=dTY&utm_content=vintage&utm_medium=fapcash&utm_source=direct","rating":5,"siteOrder":2,"price":"free","tags":[],"features":[],"categories":[{"id":"vintage-porn-premium-sites","collection":"categories_en"}],"screenshot_url":"https://cdn.staticstack.net/assets/img/r-thumbs/62bf829-faphousevintage_small.png","image_alt":"FapHouse Vintage, Paid Retro Porn Site","scraped_at":"2025-10-28T17:56:55.804Z","iconSpritesheet":"default","logoIconClass":"icon823","pros":["exclusive vintage porn","unique content","perfect streaming quality","free downloads for members","no ads","great variety of content"],"cons":["site requires a subscription fee","€9.99 per month subscription fee","extra subscription fee for some channels"],"detailedDescription":"<p>What’s up, you naughty little cum-fiend! You know, sometimes, I like to enjoy the classics. Sure, it’s nice watching the hottest girls of today get down with the nastiest sex trends in insane quality. Nowadays, it’s like you can look at any slut of your choice beat off while you watch from outside a fucking window. That’s how far technology’s come! But, there was a special kind of charm to porn back in the day. The 80s dance music, the permed hair, and stockings. I mean, holy shit! Do you remember stockings?! Remember when that used to be sexy?</p><p></p><p>Now, every time I talk to a girl about it, they just say it’s gross and sweaty! While we have the kind of porn that would blow the average person’s mind today, we can never really recapture the vibe of those porno flicks from the 70s, 80s, and 90s. I bet everything seemed so new back then too! You know what? I say we’re spoilt! We should go back to buying porno at sex shops and sitting through an entire movie we can share later with our friends. Haha! Nah, fuck that! But, it’s nice to have a little taste of what once was.</p><p></p><p>Luckily for us, a few places on the web feel the same way. And today, we’re getting that sweet vintage goodness from Faphouse.com! This site has a sweet collection of damn near every vintage movie from the 70s onwards. When I was browsing, I half expected an episode of F•R•I•E•N•D•S to pop up! It was THAT fucking retro!</p><p></p><p>I couldn’t get enough of the vintage-style recordings either. I almost felt like I was in 90s New York. I wanted to buy a cheap blow-up doll and hook up with a stripper named Candace! I’ll tell you what! The perverts back in those days were something else. I mean, you think I try hard to find porn? These guys didn’t have access to a world of sluts at the click of a button. They had to drive to a town where no one knew them, walk into a shady store with as little shame as possible, and convince the store owners they weren’t too fucked up! I’d love to go back just once, haha!</p><p></p><p>The vintage videos on Faphouse.com will have you nostalgic over a time you were never in. These aren’t just 5-10 minute clips either. These pornos are straight from the VHS tapes. You’ll be enjoying hours of old skool goodness like Joey and Chandler. The only catch is, unlike that episode of F•R•I•E•N•D•S, it won’t be free. That’s right. I’m afraid you’re gonna have to reach into that wallet yet again to watch these old gems.</p><p></p><p>I know, I know. Yet another expense on your porn budget. But, if you’ve got a taste for the pre-2000s, this might just be worth it. I mean, this is a completely seamless and ad-free experience. Furthermore, it’s EXCLUSIVE. You won’t be able to find these VHS burns anywhere else. You’ll be jacking off to shit that only people in the late 1900s got to jack off to. That’s a special kind of privilege if you ask me!</p><p></p><h3>Pure Vintage Pleasure</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Like any self-respective porn site, each thumbnail allows you to hover across the thumbnail for a seamless video preview. You’re going to be seeing a LOT of old skool orgies. There were SO many orgies back in the day. It was kind of the thing back then, along with BDSM. Now it’s step-family porn and solo amateur videos, haha! Who could have predicted that?</p><p></p><p>If you’re really into the videos you find in this category, you can click the little heart at the top of the page to add it to your favorites. And you most likely will! There’s a simple yet intuitive filter at the left of the page. There’s not much to it, but I doubt you’ll need an entire list of filters for videos made up to 50 years ago.</p><p></p><p>You can sort the search options by videos or studios. There’s also the option to sort by the most popular or the newest added. Most sites have more than just the two, but the less work for you, the quicker you can cum, right? There’s also the option to search by quality, including SD, HD, and 4K. That’s right. Your lucky ass gets to watch pornos in better quality than anyone did when they were first released!</p><p></p><h3>90s Porn Jams and Pubic Hair</h3><p></p><p></p><p>The subscription fee is €9.99 per month. Compared to most paid porn sites, this is a fucking steal! And hey, if you find that the content is too good to leave behind, you can pay a lifetime fee of €299.99! That’s about 3 years' worth of content, and you can watch the rest for free for the rest of your life. (Just don’t lose your password!)</p><p></p><p>Now, let’s get to the good stuff! Faphouse.com has a serious collection of authentic vintage porn content. I’ll tell you this; you’re gonna find a hell of a lot of orgy videos. Like I said, that was kind of the thing back in the day. If there was one thing the baby boomers loved, it was group sex and latex! (There’s a hell of a lot of BDSM content too). One of the first videos I enjoyed was like a 90s timestamp.</p><p></p><p>The title was “Nasty Anal Orgies with DP”. This video was the height of the classic porn era! It was like a celebration of 80s dance music, funky hair, pubes, and cigarettes. Believe it or not, there was a time when pornstars had hair down there! Go and check it out for yourself if you don’t believe me! I wonder why everyone started going bald… It was probably the crabs! Haha! I’d make sure everyone I fucked was clean-shaven if I knew they fucked 10 people before me!</p><p></p><p>In that video, a group of people shared one baseball bat. Yeah, you read that right! And EVERYONE got a turn! Haha! (Even the guys. And they didn’t have pussy to stick it in — I’m sure you can do the math!) I wouldn’t be surprised if everyone there walked away with some crabs. It was a beautiful mess. Just a bunch of cocks, pussy, and funky hair flying around the room. It was such a treat!</p><p></p><p>The vintage BDSM videos are just as tasty. They weren’t any tamer than the shit we watch today. I’ll tell you that! In the first BDSM video I watched, there was a bitch tied to wooden beams, getting double nipple piercings. They really went to town on that slut — whipping and teasing her pussy while she was getting off to both! That’s some old-school pleasure and pain right there.</p><p></p><h3>What I Liked</h3><p></p><p></p><p>I also love the generous video previews. Unlike many paid sites, you know what you’re getting into from the previews. There’s just enough content to tickle those balls and have you reaching for your wallet and a packet of wet wipes.</p><p></p><h3>What I Didn’t Like</h3><p></p><p></p><h3>Tips From MissAVDH</h3><p></p><p></p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p></p>"}},{"id":"88564ab48a60","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"88564ab48a60","title":"SpiceVids Vintage","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"SpiceVids.comVintage has 1500 retro porn videos available for viewing","canonical":"https://theporndude.com/zh/15533/spicevidsvintage","affiliate_url":"https://www.spicevids.com/scenes?ats=eyJhIjoxNzYsImMiOjMxMzMzLCJuIjoxMjAsInMiOjY4MCwiZSI6MTA0MzIsInAiOjJ9&sortby=rating&tags=5801&atc=vintage","rating":4,"siteOrder":3,"price":"free","tags":[],"features":[],"categories":[{"id":"vintage-porn-premium-sites","collection":"categories_en"}],"screenshot_url":"https://cdn.staticstack.net/assets/img/r-thumbs/860ca4e-spicevidsvintage_small.png","image_alt":"SpiceVids Vintage, Paid Retro Porn Site","scraped_at":"2025-10-28T17:57:10.171Z","iconSpritesheet":"default","logoIconClass":"icon1663","pros":["over 1500 vintage porn videos","easy to browse and filter","simple to watch old porn","combine and filter categories, models, and more!"],"cons":["needs more vintage porn"],"detailedDescription":"<p>Are you fucking horny for porn that harkens back to the good old days (whatever the fuck that means!)? If so, then you’re probably in the mood for some grainy, standard-definition vintage porn! See, I can read you like a goddamn book!</p><p></p><p>Spicevids has just what you’re looking for, too! Look at Spicevids.com/Vintage, and you will identify all of the different kinds of classic, old school pornographic videos that are waiting for you to discover on this unique site. I am certain as fuck that you’re going to love absolutely everything about what Spicevids.com/Vintage has available for your horny ass whenever you visit this site. Take a look right away, and see why so many old fuckers like you can’t get enough of the porn from decades ago by visiting Spicevids.com/Vintage today, and pretend like you’re in the past again!</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Over 1500 vintage videos</h3><p></p><p></p><p>That is why I’m fucking here to help your ass out on MissAVDH! I have reviewed all kinds of porn sites, but even still, if you want to watch vintage porn all in one place, you’re going to need to jump around to other sites. But thanks to Spicevids.com/Vintage. You don’t have to jump around as much as you typically would!</p><p></p><p>What do I mean by that exactly? I will tell your ass all about it! You’ll discover immediately that there are all kinds of sensational fucking vintage porn videos for you to watch! You’ll feel like you’re younger all over again, and maybe, just maybe, your pecker will be as hard as it once was.</p><p></p><p>How many vintage porn videos did I find whenever I checked out Spicevids.com/Vintage? I will tell your ass all about it! I discovered over on Spicevids.com/Vintage that there were over 1500 vintage porn videos for you to explore on the fucking porn site, and you’re going to be impressed by the number when you look at it all for yourself.</p><p></p><p>This number here goes a long way toward helping you to get your vintage porn fix whenever you are in the fucking mood. But considering how much vintage porn is actually out there on Spicevids.com/Vintage, I still found myself expecting more on the site. Which is a real shame to say the least, but it’s the goddamn truth nonetheless.</p><p></p><p>Why do I say all of that, you may be asking me? Let me fucking tell you! You see, there is an insane amount of vintage porn that’s available all around the Web. All you have to do is to look for it all on your own, and you’ll notice that there is a fuck ton of older porn that was released between the 1970s (and even earlier in some cases) and around the end of 2009 or so. Especially considering that at the end of 2009, online porn was all over the goddamn place. So there is plenty of vintage porn to be found.</p><p></p><p>But maybe that’s not your idea of vintage porn. Maybe your idea of vintage porn – and many of you horny fuckers reading what I have to say – may feel that porn is only vintage if it was released anytime before the 21st century. Fine mother fuckers, let’s play that game.</p><p></p><p>Even so, there is still a fuck ton of old porn that Spicevids.com/Vintage can add to its library. And even though over 1500 vintage videos on Spicevids.com/Vintage is a decent start, I would hope to see much more than that sooner than later. With so much old porn out there, there should be more options available on Spicevids.com/Vintage than there currently is available at the time of this review.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Browse by models and sites</h3><p></p><p></p><p>So how fucking easy is it, you may be asking me? I’ll give you an example! Let’s assume that you want to get off to a specific performer that you remember. Spicevids.com/Vintage makes that extremely fucking easy for you to pull off!</p><p></p><p>How would you do that then? First, select the ‘models’ option at the top of the homepage. Then, you can either search for a specific model, or browse through the alphabetical list until you come across the performer that you want to search for. That’s easy as fuck!</p><p></p><p>But don’t think that you can only look at one model at a time. Not a chance! In addition to browsing by a model, you can also combine several models together in your search results. So if you want to look at several performers that you remember, but want to only look at those performers, Spicevids.com/Vintage makes this easy as hell.</p><p></p><p>Spicevids.com/Vintage makes it so easy to filter the models you want to look at on the site, but the convenience doesn’t stop there! You can also choose to filter and combine certain sites if you only want to look at videos from certain vintage distributors or the like. You can even do this with the categories, too. Let me give you an example.</p><p></p><p>If you want to see certain kinds of vintage videos, combining the categories makes that happen. For example, if you want to see only vintage porn featuring beauts with huge tits or blowjob scenes, combine the appropriate category (or categories as the case may be) with the genres, fetishes, and more that you want to watch. It’s so fucking easy, and you’ll wish that other porn sites like Spicevids.com/Vintage allowed you to combine their filtering options too!</p><p></p><p>If you were hoping that you’d be able to watch all of the content on Spicevids.com/Vintage for free, though, I hate to break it to you. That’s just not going to happen, as you can’t watch fucking anything for free on Spicevids.com/Vintage. That’s not a bad thing, either. Let me explain.</p><p></p><p>When you sign up for a subscription on Spicevids.com/Vintage (the most popular plan being $20 a month), what you will recognize is that you’re not just limited to the vintage section on the site. Hell fucking no! Your subscription also gets you access to other areas of Spicevids as a whole, including every fetish and category represented as a whole.</p><p></p><p>That is an outstanding amount of fucking content for the price! Considering that Spicevids.com/Vintage doesn’t have as much vintage porn as it should have at the time of this review, that goes a long way toward convincing you to subscribe. Knowing that you have so much porn in addition to the XXX content that’s available on Spicevids.com/Vintage is fucking amazing in and of itself, and you’ll agree with me when you see for yourself!</p><p></p><p></p><h3>So easy to watch old porn!</h3><p></p><p></p><p>So go on! Watch an abundance of vintage porn all in one place! No matter if you want to get off to porn on your mobile or desktop device, Spicevids.com/Vintage makes this process so fucking easy to do. Get a look at what you’ve been missing out on by viewing everything that’s available to you on Spicevids.com/Vintage, as I know that you’ll love everything about what this fucking site has to offer your horny ass!</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Suggestions:</h3><p></p>"}},{"id":"29ee74a615cf","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"29ee74a615cf","title":"Playboy Magazines","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"iPlayboy.com is an elite section of Playboy’s official website. 60 years of digital Playboy Magazine printed for over 10 years is an exciting library.

Not only that, but we equally have access to some of the most high-tech sex toys imaginable. For a relatively small amount of money, one can open the gates to a world of pleasure that involves everything from virtual reality porn to lifelike love dolls waiting for your hard dick to empty itself in them whenever it’s ready to.</p><p></p><p>Nowadays, we can have orgasms on demand that are so damn powerful that they’d probably make our cavemen ancestors implode if they were to experience them. However, my horny friends, it’s equally never been a more critical time to stay linked to our porn roots because it’s never been easier to let them fade away into the past.</p><p></p><p>Do you remember the days when your masturbatory marathons would take place with your head stuck between the pages of a porn magazine? Do you fondly recall trying to aim your cock at the last second to avoid spurting ropes of cum across the pages of your favorite smut mag and sticking the pages together forever? Man, those were the fuckin’ days!</p><p></p><p>Just as we’re granted a booming selection of porn to choose from these days, so too did we have a vast array of adult magazines to indulge in back in the day. From Color Climax to Genesis and Gent to Juggs, there were enough XXX publications to make you porn drunk.</p><p></p><p>However, one magazine stood head and shoulders above the rest. The jewel in the crown of porn magazines, if you will. Yes, I’m talking about Playboy Magazine! It was born around Christmas in 1953 when twenty-seven-year-old Hugh Hefner started the magazine in Chicago in 1953.</p><p></p><p>To bring the idea for Playboy Magazine to life, Hefner’s mom loaned him $1,000. Get your minds out of the gutter! The initial 50,000 copies featured Marilyn Monroe on the cover and sold out in no time, and the rest, as they say, is history! The magazine became one of the most recognizable brands on earth with a growing reputation for its centerfolds of nude and semi-nude models known as Playmates.</p><p></p><p>Playboy Magazine played a vital role in the sexual revolution, and some of the women who starred in it naked ranged from Pamela Anderson to Anna Nicole Smith. As an old-school porn fanatic, Playboy is a brand I love and respect, so I was overjoyed to see Iplayboy.com land on my porn radar for a review.</p><p></p><p>However, I was also a little nervous. Would Iplayboy.com be able to live up to the brand's high standards, or would it serve as a disappointment? My impending MissAVDH review would find out. But first, what is Iplayboy.com, and what does it offer?</p><p></p><p></p><h3>What is Iplayboy.com?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Of course, Playboy Magazine was never free, and neither is this archive. The pricing options range from $4 to $8 a month, depending on how many months you buy in bulk or whether you sign up monthly.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>What’s the Playboy Magazine Archive Like on Iplayboy.com?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>However, to make sure it is, I decided to sign up for myself and look between the virtual pages to see what it can offer. Prepare to meet some of my personal highlights from this vast collection of digitized Playboy Magazines!</p><p></p><p>● The Marilyn Monroe Issue, December 1953 - Let’s start with the iconic issue of Playboy Magazine that started it all. This old-school magazine has the stunning Marilyn Monroe on the cover and laid the foundations for the entire Playboy brand. Inside its pages is a time-warping blend of material that is fascinating to read through. While nowhere near as hardcore as later issues, it’s a timeless classic that any fan of adult content needs to read.</p><p>● Pamela Anderson, January 2016 - The divine Pamela Anderson was a common feature on the cover of Playboy Magazine over the years. Still, one of my personal favorites that really summed up her decades of modeling was the January 2016 issue that showed her on the front cover with a nymphomaniac-style grin on her face and a gorgeous gold collar that spelled out the word ‘’SEX’’ while she covers her beautiful tits with her elbows. It might be controversial, as there’s no doubt many people will be furious I didn’t choose one of her earlier appearances, but this one sums up the entire Pamela Anderson Playboy era, in my opinion.</p><p>● Anna Nicole Smith, June 1993 - Playboy Magazine began with Marilyn Monroe, and Anna Nicole Smith (RIP) did a fine job carrying the torch in this June 1993 issue. Her black and white shot looked incredibly similar to Monroe's, and it was arguably one of the most iconic Playboy Magazine covers ever printed.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>The Design of the Site</h3><p></p><p></p><p>A sleek and straightforward welcome message sits underneath the top bar that designates Iplayboy.com as the official Playboy archive from 1953 to the current year. You’re then introduced to a significant featured issue relevant to the current season of the year, with an additional section showing you the playball, the table of contents, and the monthly letter from the editors.</p><p></p><p>The following section, outlined with a sleek hairline divider complimented by a jet-black Playboy Bunny logo, shows you three featured issues of Playboy Magazine via ideally scanned front covers. When you hover over them, the year of publication fades into view. Below is a similar section showing one featured issue chosen by the editors.</p><p></p><p>The homepage then features a call to action that informs potential subscribers that they can have access to 60+ years of Playboy Magazine with the chance to ‘’enjoy every single Playmate, pictorial, interview, story, and more.’’ Underneath this is a portfolio of more issues that displays a randomized collection of magazines covered in rows of six with the date of publication listed beneath.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>What I Like Most About it</h3><p></p><p></p><p>The fact that Iplayboy.com has built a digitized collection of over 60+ years' worth of adult magazines is downright impressive. Also, the magazines are incredibly well-scanned, and it feels as though you’re reading something printed yesterday, thanks to epic resolution and quality restoration.</p><p></p><p>I also found that the monthly membership fee is incredibly cheap for what this site offers. I mean, for anybody who is a fan of Playboy Magazine, $4 to $8 a month (depending on how many months you buy) is a minimal fee to access this dick-draining archive. Seeing restored photos of Pamela Anderson’s and Anna Nicole Smith’s naked bodies alone is enough to hand over the cost of your average coffee!</p><p></p><p></p><h3>What I Don’t Like</h3><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Suggestions I Have for Iplayboy.com</h3><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p></p><p></p><p>However, if you’re not well-versed in the magazine's various issues and those considered to be some of the most iconic ever printed, then you’d better do some research to find some of the must-read copies!</p>"}},{"id":"4f18bf043bf5","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"4f18bf043bf5","title":"Vintage Cuties","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"VintageCuties.com provides a large amount of retro porn from 1850 to 1990.

So much porn is made and forgotten that you have to appreciate the photos and videos that have stood the test of time. When you’re cranking it to vintage smut, you’re continuing a sexual legacy that may have lasted a hundred years or more. Imagine being so sexy people are fapping to your memory a century after you died.</p><p></p><p><strong>VintageCuties.com is a premium porn site and historical archive of smut spanning from 1850 to 1990</strong>. The site itself got its start in 2005, making it somewhat historical in its own right. While the early aughts will be remembered by smut scholars as the age of cam sites and reality porn networks, Vintage Cuties proved there’s always a horny market for the classics. That retro sex legacy continues to this day, carrying the fuck flicks of the past into the future and beyond.</p><p></p><h3>A Masturbatory Journey Through History</h3><p></p><p></p><p>As the web’s preeminent expert on dirty movies and jacking off, I often like to crack jokes about the pornographic history degree I got at Yale and the TED Talks I’ve given about the aesthetics of felching in modern cinema. The academic vibe on VintageCuties makes me feel almost like a fraud. I’m not even joking when I say you can really learn something around here, studying up while shaking your dick at the screen.</p><p></p><p>Of course, despite the site's educational value, there’s still plenty of dick-shaking to be done. This is, after all, a vintage porn site. I like how the PBS tone kind of shatters when you notice all those sepia-toned photos are naked ladies, blowjobs, and all-out old-timey orgies. Sometimes you hear the phrase “vintage porn” and you think classy nudes and softcore poses, but there’s plenty of hardcore stuff and even some BDSM right on the landing page.</p><p></p><p>Some of you are going to be surprised they even had porn like this back in the old days. I watched one of their movies from the 40s, overlayed with old-time orchestral music since the film didn’t even record audio, of some sexy black chicks dancing for the camera. They’ve got stripper moves like standing on their heads while the white boy touches their twats. The clothes come off as they dance, revealing exactly why they’re called VintageCuties. Once they’re fully nude, they strip the dude and fuck him.</p><p></p><h3>Legendary Pornstars of the Past</h3><p></p><p></p><p>They’ve got porno movies starring giant-dick megastud and multiple murder suspect John Holmes during his peak. You younger perverts may remember him as the guy Mark Wahlberg played in Boogie Nights, except John’s monster ding-dong wasn’t a prosthetic. You’ll see that machine at work inside those vintage cuties in the archives.</p><p></p><p>Maybe you’re more interested in the classic babes, and I don’t blame you. How about Desiree West, the classic ‘70s ebony cocksucker who was inducted into the XRCO Hall of Fame in 1997? There’s also Candy Samples, a massive-jugged babe who banged her way through the ‘60s, ‘70s and ‘80s. She’s mostly known for her later work as a MILF, and also starred in 1974’s sexploitation classic, Flesh Gordon.</p><p></p><p>Vintage Cuties has some really informative, well-researched writeups about vintage babes like June Palmer, “one of England’s greatest gifts to the nude magazines of the 1960s.” I also learned more about Sylvia McFarland’s multi-decade run in the business and her mature ebony boobs than I’ve ever known about my own grandma. Virgina Bell, Margaret Wallace, Linda Gordon and Little Oral Annie have all been covered in detail.</p><p></p><p>Altogether, they’ve got around 800 vintage pornstars doing their dirty thing in photos and videos immortalized for all time. It feels like some legit Time Life series giving us an educational and entertaining tour of what our grandparents were into. Only, you get to enjoy the entire thing with your pants around your ankles, your junk completely coated in Vaseline, and the Viagra dust you snorted dripping down the back of your throat.</p><p></p><h3>Cheaper Than a Time Machine</h3><p></p><p></p><p>The standard membership at Vintage Cuties costs $30 a month, the same going rate you’ve been paying for most paysites over the last few years. Members also get unlimited trial access to a handful of mega-sites, including Naturists, Real Mature Amateurs, Homemade Junk, Hairy Pussy Cuties and Amazing Grannies. If you get tired of looking at old nude photos, you can look at old naked ladies. There are nearly 200 hours of content in the bonus area, so I hope you’ve got a bunch of sick days saved up.</p><p></p><p>None of the porn on VintageCuties is new. In fact, some of it dates back 170 years. That doesn’t mean the site stopped updating decades ago. The vintage porn enthusiasts who run this joint are always on the hunt for new old stock, retro blowjobs, threesomes and lesbian scenes. While some modern paysites have slowed down their updates thanks to the coronavirus pandemic, VintageCuties.com is still promising updates every day.</p><p></p><p>Daily updates since 2005? Even if you sat on beanbags in the retard math class, you probably realize that’s got to be a massive stash of porn they’re already sitting on. Somebody get this pervert an honorary degree! I’m not even counting all those bonus sites when I tell you the vintage porn collection here is absolutely fucking enormous.</p><p></p><p>According to the stats on the signup page, they’ve got almost 200,000 vintage photos. There are 1,300 retro videos to watch and over 1,500 vintage adult magazines, scanned and ready to “read”. I’m professor MissAVDH and your homework today includes a fap to some of the 1850-1920 Era videos, a look at the Burlesque Girls photos, and reading the site’s well-researched history of Bonnie Logan, ‘50s pin-up queen.</p><p></p><h3>Like Jacking Off at the Museum</h3><p></p><p></p><p>It’s hard to find real fault with VintageCuties. The collection is a little softcore by modern standards, but they’ve managed to archive a fair amount of surprisingly hard and kinky material. I think the biggest turnoff for potential subscribers might be the image and video quality, which is naturally going to be way fucking lower than a movie made today. If that’s your beef, though, maybe vintage porn just isn’t your thing.</p><p></p><p>VintageCuties.com is a winner if you’re looking for a deep library of historical dirty movies and retro pornography. The collection itself is massive, and the setup makes you feel like you’re learning something while you aggressively yank at your lubed-up genitals. Roll in all that bonus content and you’ve got a really well-rounded collection of smut. These guys are one of the last paysites offering a free trial, so give it a shot if you’re into the classics.</p>"}},{"id":"36502cac1a0c","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"36502cac1a0c","title":"Private Classics","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"PrivateClassics.com collects retro video magazines and movies from Private over 50 years of European pornography and is updated daily","canonical":"https://theporndude.com/zh/5654/privateclassics","affiliate_url":"https://www.privateclassics.com/en/?nats=MjQzOTUuNi4xMy4xNTEuMC4wLjAuMC4w","rating":4,"siteOrder":6,"price":"free","tags":[],"features":[],"categories":[{"id":"vintage-porn-premium-sites","collection":"categories_en"}],"screenshot_url":"https://cdn.staticstack.net/assets/img/r-thumbs/733b4c7-privateclassics_small.png","image_alt":"Private Classics, Paid Retro Porn Sites","scraped_at":"2025-10-28T17:57:54.365Z","iconSpritesheet":"custom-favicon-spritesheet.png","iconPosition":"-464px -448px","iconClassName":"ctm-icon5654","logoIconClass":"icon5654","pros":["vintage porn from private’s 50-year history","high-quality vintage smut","1600+ scenes, 350+ magazines, 2000+ photosets, 250+ movies","daily updates","downloads included"],"cons":["mediocre organization (no tags)"],"detailedDescription":"<p>I bet everyone has their own Private Classics when they’re jacking off. You know the ones I’m talking about: those perfect pornos you may have found 5, 10, 20 years ago that still make you hard as a fucking rock every single time. It’s no wonder some of the long-running Internet porn sites have cashed in on the fad, offering up some of their vintage hits, oldies and goldies that put them on the map in the first place. I mean, shit, just because it’s old doesn’t mean you’re going to get bored of kitchen hookups, bedroom threesomes, and wild anal scenes out in public.</p><p></p><p>I reviewed Private.com the other day, and I couldn’t help noticing their archive doesn’t stretch back through the full run of their website. Well, it turns out they’ve got another website, PrivateClassics.com, where they’ve got <strong>a vintage porn library spanning the 1960s to the early aughts</strong>. It’s a premium site, so you’ll need to bring your wallet, but the thousands of daily visitors hitting up the joint tells me they’ve got more than just stale old pussy for sale.</p><p></p><h3>Fifty Years of Dirty Movies</h3><p></p><p></p><p>And there’s a lot to love at PrivateClassics, even from the tour page. There’s a 5-minute preview montage near the top of the screen that offers a rapid-fire peek into their collection. You’ll see hairy-muffed hotties getting their pussies eaten, blonde MILFs getting fucked at the beach, dirty girls getting down in motel rooms and even some leather-clad BDSM fun for the kinksters out there. Aspiring smut historians can check out the various pubic hair trimming styles that have been popular over the years, from the big puffy afro pubes from days of yore to the bald beaver orgies of more recent days gone.</p><p></p><p>Scroll down and you’ll find some screengrabs and thumbnails, as well as a thick selection of the Latest Magazine and Movie Updates. It says “Latest,” but you can feel the vintage vibe coming off every Private Classics release. For the oldschool wankers who miss VHS cases and porn magazines with naked T&amp;A on the cover, you’re going to feel right at home. It’s like hitting the old off-highway porn store, minus the odor and aggressive truckers fighting for gloryhole access.</p><p></p><p>One of the things that immediately strikes me is the overall quality of the lesbian scenes, big-titty bimbos and classic fuckfests. Some vintage porn sites peddle in grainy, washed-out smut where you can barely make out the interlocking genitals. PrivateClassics.com puts out surprisingly crisp, clear porno despite the age. If you’re into the vintage stuff, it pays to crank off to a porn outfit that’s been doing it right for so many decades.</p><p></p><h3>Cheaper Than a Stack of Skin Rags</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Catchy slogans are one thing, but what really catches my eye on the signup page are the hard numbers. Given Private’s long-ass history of putting out dirty movies, it doesn’t come as a huge surprise that <strong>Private Classics is packed with over 1600 sexy scenes, 350 filthy magazines, 2000 explicit photo sets, and 250 vintage porno movies</strong>. You know, I’ve been looking for something like this ever since Costco stopped selling their 50-gallon barrels of classic smut. If you’re a bulk shopper when it comes to fap fodder and you like the vintage stuff, this is looking like a killer choice.</p><p></p><p>Vintage paysites abide by slightly different rules than their contemporary counterparts. With current sites, I like to see weekly updates at the least, but it can get a little complicated when your format deals in butt-sex movies shot before you were even born. PrivateClassics definitely has an appealing release rate, with “new” content hitting the site every day. It’s like getting a history lesson every day, but it’s cheaper than community college and you don’t have to write any fucking papers.</p><p></p><p>They may be dealing in old smut, but the payment methods are as modern as any of the competition. Most of you will pay with Visa or PayPal, but the crypto investors and general cybercriminals can spend some of that bitcoin you’ve got piling up. There’s even a gift card option if you’re just trying to get rid of those fucking Starbucks cards grandma keeps sending you. I told her I got banned after the last indecent exposure, but she just won’t listen.</p><p></p><h3>Vintage Chicks with All Kinds of Tricks</h3><p></p><p></p><p>I’m a little bit disappointed about the general lack of organization at PrivateClassics. They don’t seem to use any tags, which most paysites and free tubes use to sort through the collection. Without tags, you’re only really able to search through information listed in the titles and video descriptions. A lot of these films have a 2- or 3-sentence synopsis that doesn’t list all the fetishes and sex acts included, which means it’s going to be harder to find the kinky shit you’re into.</p><p></p><p>While it may be a little harder to find the full list of DPs, lesbian sequences or public squirting, there’s still plenty to shake your dick at. I decided to start my official fap test of PrivateClassics.com with a flick called Lynn Stone In A Futuristic Gangbang. Private Classics doesn’t list the original release date, but based on Lynn’s filmography, I’m going to guess it was filmed in the very early 2000s. Let’s see what they thought the future held for us.</p><p></p><h3>Orgies of the Future from the Past</h3><p></p><p></p><p>I can immediately see why Private considers this flick one of their Private Classics. The gangbang moves along at a good pace, with plenty of movement and switcheroos even as the body count rises. Lynn’s got a fucking gorgeous, tight little body and doesn’t miss a beat even with all those dicks coming at her. Obviously, the video quality isn’t 4K UHD, but it’s nice and clean, without any VHS degradation or warbly sound.</p><p></p><p>She takes it in every hole in this Futuristic Gangbang, often all at once. The camerawork is solid, demonstrating once again why Private has long been considered a high-end operation. We’re never left trying to lean over someone’s shoulder, hoping for a view. In fact, the views were so good that I took advantage of the <strong>downloads included with the standard membership price</strong>.</p><p></p><p>The lackluster, tagless organization of PrivateClassics.com was the only sour note I could find during my visit. It’s a minor complaint that will affect fetishists the most, since it makes searching the site a little more difficult. General fans of classic porn will certainly have more than enough to shake their ding-dongs at, with the high-quality standards you expect from one of Europe’s longest-running and most popular porn studios.</p>"}},{"id":"763556830075","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"763556830075","title":"Score Classics","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"ScoreClassics.com shows hundreds of classic big-tits beauties with uncut retro porn and nude photo albums and updates every week with other welfare sites for you to explore","canonical":"https://theporndude.com/zh/4841/scoreclassics","affiliate_url":"https://www.scoreclassics.com/home/?nats=GC1984.2.124.380.0.0.0.0.0","rating":4,"siteOrder":7,"price":"free","tags":[],"features":[],"categories":[{"id":"vintage-porn-premium-sites","collection":"categories_en"}],"screenshot_url":"https://cdn.staticstack.net/assets/img/r-thumbs/cae83a6-scoreclassics_small.png","image_alt":"Score Classics, Paid Retro Porn Sites","scraped_at":"2025-10-28T17:58:08.328Z","iconSpritesheet":"custom-favicon-spritesheet.png","iconPosition":"-320px -432px","iconClassName":"ctm-icon4841","logoIconClass":"icon4841","pros":["raw, uncut video from the ‘80s and ‘90s","classic big-titty pornstars","hundreds of vintage photo galleries","downloads included","weekly updates","guest access to network sites","low price"],"cons":["retro video resolution"],"detailedDescription":"<p>ScoreClassics has a name that sets you up for something big. The “Classics” part lets you know you’re about to see some legendary shit, the kind of shit that has stood the test of time and is still talked about years or decades later. The “Score” part tells us we’re going to see somebody win big. It might be your favorite basketball team back in the ‘70s, but let’s be real, you’re reading this on MissAVDH. That big winning isn’t a sports thing, a video game tournament or a gambling problem; when I talk about scoring, I’m talking about sex.</p><p></p><p>True to its name, <strong>ScoreClassics.com is an archive of big-titty retro smut</strong>. The Score Group has been shooting movies starring the hottest chicks with the hugest racks in the world for nearly 30 years now, so naturally, they’ve got a nice back catalog they still love sharing with the rest of the class. If you love giant boobies and have an appreciation for vintage sex films, I have a feeling this is going to get you all hard and drippy.</p><p></p><h3>The True Classics of Scoring</h3><p></p><p></p><p>They start talking up the product right from the landing page, saying shit like, “Watch the legends before they were legends!” The page itself has an old-school VHS vibe with its light text and vintage typography. A couple of classic MILFs, Alexis Love and Carol Brown, expose their huge fucking jugs as an example of those legends.</p><p></p><p><strong>Score Classics includes some truly legendary big-titty pornstars</strong>. They’ve got retro starlets like Devon Daniels, Jeannine Oldfield and Cathy Patrick. They’ve got a lot of Erica Everest’s old work, plus Louise Montgomery, SaRenna and Debbie Ashby. Some of you old motherfuckers might remember beating off to these ladies back in the day, while you younger perverts can experience the same erotic thrills your parents and grandparents did.</p><p></p><p>One of the gimmicks around here is raw, uncut pornos from the ‘80s and ‘90s. There’s a blurb About Score Classics on the tour page that gives a little background on their concept. The old tapes released back in the day had been chopped to pieces, filtered, the old audio often destroyed or buried under wow-chicka-bow-wow soundtracks. The movies on this site are direct rips from old UMatic and Beta tapes, including all the bloopers and retakes that were cut out of the original releases. You’ll hear the photographers talking and the background chatter, and see all kinds of shit that nobody has ever seen outside of the studios and editing floors.</p><p></p><h3>Cheaper Than a VHS Collection</h3><p></p><p></p><p>These days, porn is instantly accessible from anywhere and it’s cheap as hell. Most sites charge the exact same amount; paysites usually cost $30, because that’s what people are willing to pay. ScoreClassics.com is offering classic porno, but they aren’t ripping you off with those classic VHS prices. The standard one-month recurring price is only $20, cheaper than most sites, though it’s $30 if you want a non-recurring membership. They also offer various countdown deals when you first load up the page, so you can save even more off the regular rate.</p><p></p><p>(Here’s a tip: instead of shelling out more for a non-recurring membership anywhere, just remember to cancel your membership! Most sites let you keep your remaining membership days, so it usually doesn’t matter when in the cycle you cancel. Just check the fine print before you pull the trigger.)</p><p></p><p>One of the big differences between modern and classic porno is the issue of ownership. In the old days, you straight-up bought your porno and brought it home with you to keep forever. These days, it’s common for paysites to offer streaming-only access or charging extra for members who want to save anything. <strong>Score Classics keeps it classic by including downloads in the regular price</strong>. Nice!</p><p></p><p>The Score Group have been peddling smut for decades, so they really know what they’re doing. One of their best tricks is throwing in guest access to all their porn sites with your ScoreClassics membership. It’s meant to entice you into buying further memberships, which they’ll give you at a discount, but cheapskates will appreciate all the free porn you get out of the deal. Their whole network has a big-titty theme, so look forward to erotic adventures from sites like Black and Stacked, Crystal Gunn’s World and Busty Dannie Ashe.</p><p></p><h3>Hundreds of Galleries and Vintage Pornos</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Score Classics is different. Instead of the usual yawn-inducing screencaps, they’re showcasing hundreds of vintage nude photoshoots of voluptuous babes. They’re nice, thick photo sets, too, sometimes running upwards of 100 pictures per gallery. If you appreciate classic naked photography, you’re going to enjoy the library here.</p><p></p><p>I know a lot of you modern fuckers skip the photos, and that’s fine. ScoreClassics also has a few hundred retro videos in their archives. It’s a nice, kinky mix of perversion, too. The newest videos added to the site include big-haired, big-boobed lesbians banging each other with strap-ons, giant-jugged babes riding cock in the bathtub, and a couple of solo masturbation shows. Scoreland, their modern site, mostly deals in solo material, so I’m happy to see a heavier ratio of couples having hardcore sex.</p><p></p><p>I think porn fans worry about how much new content they’re going to get on any premium site, but the issue’s more complicated on a retro site. If the smut’s already old, how can they keep adding new stuff? Well, maybe they have a vault they’re slowly unpacking or perhaps they’re just withholding boobies, but either way, Score Classics is frequently updated with “new” vintage porn. <strong>Members can expect a fresh movie and a couple of galleries every week</strong>.</p><p></p><h3>A Time Machine to the Big-Tit Old Days</h3><p></p><p></p><p>These chicks have huge hair and even huger tatas. I sometimes wonder if women with big boobs lose their natural appreciation of the anatomy, but that doesn’t seem to be the case here. Both broads are eager to feel up, grope, lick and suck on each other’s monster tits. The pussy eating begins a few minutes later, and the dildos come out around the halfway mark.</p><p></p><p>My only complaint about Score Classics isn’t really a complaint about the site and more of an observation about classic porno. Having grown used to the crisp clarity of HD, the graininess of the film looks pretty lo-fi. While it’s going to turn off some modern consumers, it’s part of the appeal of vintage smut.</p><p></p><p>ScoreClassics.com is an easy site to recommend to vintage porn fans who love big titties, as well as huge breast enthusiasts who also have an appreciation for classic cinema. The website absolutely delivers on their front-page promise, serving up hundreds of raw, uncut retro movies starring history’s most well-endowed video whores. The content and low price are reason enough to subscribe, with a nice selection of bonus material to sweeten the deal.</p>"}},{"id":"fc74827e99c4","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"fc74827e99c4","title":"Vintage Classic Porn","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"VintageClassicPorn.com has a collection of 4,300 porn videos from the early 1920s to the 1980s and over 175,000 retro porn photos updated daily","canonical":"https://theporndude.com/zh/5656/vintageclassicporn","affiliate_url":"https://sweetheartsclassics.com/","rating":4,"siteOrder":8,"price":"free","tags":[],"features":[],"categories":[{"id":"vintage-porn-premium-sites","collection":"categories_en"}],"screenshot_url":"https://cdn.staticstack.net/assets/img/r-thumbs/70cb19d-vintageclassicporn_small.png","image_alt":"Vintage Classic Porn, Paid Retro Porn Site","scraped_at":"2025-10-28T17:58:17.303Z","iconSpritesheet":"default","logoIconClass":"icon963","pros":["4,300+ vintage porn videos","nearly 175,000 retro sex photos","top old-time pornstars","daily updates","includes access to massive smut network","downloads included"],"cons":["confusing network setup"],"detailedDescription":"<p>VintageClassicPorn isn’t just for grandpas, porn historians and dapper lads in crotchless zoot suits.

While it’s true that society has grown far more accepting of such things as casual sex and nudity, lesbianism and fucking whole rooms full of friends, people have always been horny and oft willing to act on their urges, even on camera. <strong>VintageClassicPorn includes some truly hardcore smut from the olden days</strong>.</p><p></p><p>There are rows of sepia-toned classy nudes stretched across the tour page, which is what many people picture when they think of Vintage Classic Porn, along with big-titty ‘50s MILFs in lingerie. What some of you may not be expecting is the vintage pussy licking from the twenties and black-and-white blowjobs from the thirties. They’ve clearly dug into some archives to find these rare gems of historic filth.</p><p></p><p>The VintageClassicPorn.com archives run from the early ‘20s up until the ‘80s. They offer a legitimate sociological sideview of society’s attitudes toward sex and film, not to mention the trends in pubic hair maintenance. I clicked the “Play” button on a video thumbnail from the sixties, hoping for a better look at this big-haired broad licking a dick. They may peddle classic smut, but they’re pulling the modern paysite trick of sending you to the signup page when you think you’re getting a free video preview.</p><h3>Cranking It to the Oldies</h3><p></p><p></p><p>One of the biggest factors I consider when I sign up for a paysite is how often they update. You expect a good studio to bang out at least one new scene or movie per week. It’s understood that as part of your exchange, they’re going to spend some of your money creating new material. It’s a little different on a site like VintageClassicPorn, because the photos were taken and film shot decades ago. They’re constantly on the hunt for vintage porn, which they add to the collection daily. In some sense, they have a leg up on the studios, who see their productions hampered by the pandemic in many cases.</p><p></p><p>Some stats out front get more specific about what you’re paying for. Right now, the stash contains over 4,300 vintage porn videos and almost 175,000 retro sex photos—what a relief. Ever since Costco stopped selling bulk cases of vintage X-rated DVDs, I’d been worrying I’d never find a new source.</p><p></p><p>They also sweeten the deal even more by including four bonus sites with your VintageClassicPorn.com membership. The caption is actually mislabeled, so you can see the 5-for-1 deal was upgraded from a 3-for-1 at some point. With any luck, they’ll add even more bonus fuck flicks and vintage pics. The current ticket includes Rodox, RetroRaw, Pornstar Classics and Color Climax.</p><h3>But Wait, There’s Even More?</h3><p></p><p></p><p><strong>It turns out that network is way fucking bigger than the handful of retro sites they mention on the tour page</strong>. I clicked the link to Watch All Network Updates and got sent to the SecretFriends video portal. There’s a Studios dropdown on that page that lists dozens of studios and paysites included. Color Climax, VintageClassicPorn and the other expected retro sites are there, as are more modern operations like VRTeenrs, Cuckoldest, Plumperd, and YoungBusty. It’s a lovely range of material, both new and old.</p><p></p><p>Of course, I’m here for that vintage smut, so I clicked the VintageClassicPorn. Interestingly, the digits beside the studio name in the dropdown tell me there are only 446 movies filmed in this area. It looks like those tour page numbers are a little jumbled and unclear, but overall, you do end up with an absolute shit-ton of masturbatory entertainment.</p><p></p><p>Once I got to the Vintage Classic Porn area on SecretFriends, I noticed the upload dates on all those grainy blowjobs and classic orgies were nearly a decade old. If you’re after the retro stuff, I guess you’re better off staying on the RetroRaw page instead of clicking through to all the network updates. I believe that page mixes the updates from their vintage porn brands, though I’m not 100% positive of that. It’s a confusing setup.</p><h3>Girls Fucking Before You Were Born</h3><p></p><p></p><p>I picked a good one to start. It’s an hour-long Color Climax flick with a couple of cute Danish chicks double-teaming on some lucky dude. The video is obviously pretty goddamn grainy by today’s standards, but it’s definitely clear enough for a good wank. The girls stroke and suck his cock while he moans over a soundtrack straight out of an old-timey gameshow.</p><p></p><p>My biggest complaint about VintageClassicPorn isn’t the confusing setup. It’s the lack of genre tags you find on almost every other porn site. The more modern stuff on the network is tagged well, but it’s scattershot at best on the actual Vintage Classic Porn. If you’re looking for specific material, it may take a lot of digging since you can’t just use a search bar.</p><p></p><p>VintageClassicPorn.com is a vintage sex site with some interesting quirks. You certainly get a killer bang for your buck, with multiple well-stocked retro sites on top of a full-fledged porn network membership with a little of everything. The organization is lacking and the overall setup is more than a little confusing, but they make up for the inconvenience with the sheer volume of XXX content they throw at their members. This seems like a good membership option for porn fans who love it all, including those classic beauties and vintage sluts.</p>"}}]

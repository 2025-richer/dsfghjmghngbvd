They’ve sold over a million boxes since 2007, and the company itself has been around for a couple of decades now. Longevity is always important for a company hawking dick pills, as I learned the hard way from buying sketchy truck-stop formulations with names like Black Rhino Turbo-horn XTRA and Manly Stamina Blaster. Now that the rash is finally going away, I’ve been spending time looking for erectile enhancement products with a little more actual science to back them up.</p><p></p><p><strong>VigRXPlus.com offers boner pills designed to give you “Bigger, Harder, Longer Lasting Erections On Demand.”</strong> The landing page features a shirtless buff guy with a pretty girl feeling his firm pecs, a box of the product superimposed over the duo to suggest they owe this intimate moment to the little red capsules. That’s cool and everything, but it’s going to take a little more to sell me on the stuff. Let’s see what else they’ve got to convince me.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Better Humping Through Chemistry?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>One of their big selling points, listed right below that checklist, is an endorsement from Dr. Steven Lamm, best known as the doctor on The View. It’s kind of funny to me that they chose this dude, because while I’m sure middle-aged women know his name and face, most male perverts have never heard of him. Say what you want about TV doctors, but broads in the 25-54 age range trust and respect this dude. There’s a two-minute video of him clearly reading from a teleprompter or cue card with no emotion whatsoever.</p><p></p><p>Honestly, I don’t give much of a fuck about quasi-celebrity endorsements. I’m more interested in the results of the clinical study. VigRXPlus did see some measurable results in an 84-day triple-blind study. The full 56-page report is available as a PDF for those interested in the methodology and other details, but I’ll summarize the findings for the rest of you lazy perverts.</p><p></p><p>The study tracked 75 dudes, ages 25 to 50, as they used VigRX Plus for 84 days. Breaking down the numbers, guys using the pills had a nearly 60% increase in their ability to penetrate their partners, a 47% increase in overall sex drive and desire, and a 71.43% increase in sexual and intercourse satisfaction. They also saw a 62.82% increase in their ability to keep their cocks hard, a 22.49% increase in orgasm quantity and quality, and a 61% increase in overall sex drive.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>What’s in This Stuff? Crack?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Boners are a tricky thing, though, and the placebo effect arguably counts for more when you’re dealing with a product like this than something intended to clear your adult acne. Sometimes all a dude needs is a little extra confidence, and snake oil might be enough to do it for them. That’s why I was curious to dig into the ingredients to see what they were feeding their customers, and if there was any data to back up its effectiveness.</p><p></p><p>“<strong>VigRX Plus has been formulated with a series of 10 potent natural erection precursors, aphrodisiacs and libido enhancers that quickly build up in your system to measurably improve your sexual performance</strong>,” it says out front, going on to explain how the product boosts nitric oxide levels to increase blood flow, a common feature for erectile enhancers. Further, it’s supposed to boost your testosterone, which should make you hornier, among other benefits.</p><p></p><p>You’ll find a full list of ingredients on VigRXPlus.com, with photos and a little background info. Some of them are pretty standard for these types of products, like Epimedium Leaf Extract, which you probably know as Horny Goat Weed. This stuff was available long before Viagra, and research suggests it has a similar method of action, though it’s much weaker than the real vitamin V. There’s also Asian Red Ginseng, another well-known and popular herb that’s been used for literally thousands of years for libido issues and a whole host of other problems.</p><p></p><p>Other ingredients include Muira Pauma Bark Extract, which I’ve been noticing in more supplements recently. Hawthorn Berry, Catuaba Bark, Saw Palmetto, and Ginkgo Biloba are also included, with a dose of Bioperine to help your body make the most of the full formula. Bioperine is a patented chemical cousin of Piperine, the active ingredient in black pepper; both are included in various supplements for their synergistic effect with other chemicals.</p><p></p><p>Google any of these ingredients and you’ll find a mixed bag of research and data on each of them. Like many herbal supplements, some of the “proof” is a little more nebulous than the hard evidence you’ll find for pharmaceuticals like Cialis. On the flip side, the good news is that <strong>all the ingredients are generally considered pretty fucking safe</strong>. I’m not saying you should pop a whole bottle to see what happens, but I’d bet my dick it doesn’t kill you. The VigRXPlus.com marketing copy even says, “there are no reported side effects.”</p><p></p><p></p><h3>How Much Do These Bigger Boners Cost?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>One of the ingredients I was expecting to see in VigRX Plus was either L-Citrulline or L-Arginine, which quickly boost nitric oxide levels to give a noticeable boner boost. Neither is in the main pill, but they’re both in VigRX Nitric Oxide Support, a month of which is included with the 6- or 12-month supplies.</p><p></p><p>Even with the freebies, this stuff is crazy-expensive. Essentially, you’re paying for their proprietary blend of herbs and spices, since you could buy capsules of the individual ingredients for less, as well as the convenience of popping one dose instead of a handful of herbal gel caps that taste like dirt. <strong>They do offer a 67-day money-back guarantee, though you’ll still have to pay shipping charges</strong>. The effects are supposed to build up over 30-60 days, so that should be enough time to figure out if it’s going to do the trick for you.</p><p></p><p>Honestly, I’d be surprised if they’re moving as many units as they did a decade ago, and I wouldn’t be the least bit surprised to see the VigRXPlus price drop dramatically in the coming months or years. If you’ve read my review of ForHims, you know that “real” boner pills like Viagra, Cialis, and their generic equivalents are now readily available for a lot less money, with a free online doctor’s visit included. That alone makes these herbal products less appealing, unless you’re specifically looking for a non-pharmaceutical cure for your boner woes.</p><p></p><p>If that describes you, check out what VigRXPlus.com has to offer. The safe, natural ingredients are a potential alternative to laboratory-made chemicals, and some of them have been used as ED treatments for hundreds or even thousands of years. It’s a little pricey, but it may be worth it for that boost in erectile capability, not to mention the piece of mind that comes along with it. That money-back guarantee is a big selling point here, because all you’re really risking is some shipping costs if the stuff doesn’t do the trick. Good luck!</p>"}},{"id":"b11bb19414a8","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"b11bb19414a8","title":"Semenax","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"Semenax.com is a male enhancement pill that has been proven to increase ejaculation by 20 or more and increase orgasm intensity.","canonical":"https://theporndude.com/zh/6052/semenax","affiliate_url":"https://www.semenax.com/","rating":4,"siteOrder":3,"price":"free","tags":[],"features":[],"categories":[{"id":"male-enhancement-pills","collection":"categories_en"}],"screenshot_url":"https://cdn.staticstack.net/assets/img/r-thumbs/84bcbac-semenax_small.png","image_alt":"Semenax, aphrodisiac","scraped_at":"2025-10-28T22:15:00.416Z","iconSpritesheet":"default","logoIconClass":"icon609","pros":["pills to make you cum more and cum harder","clinically proven effects","medically backed ingredients","67-day money-back guarantee","15% off promo"],"cons":["limited evidence for a couple of ingredients"],"detailedDescription":"<p>I thought Semenax was going to be a porn comic about a barbarian with a raging sword of flesh, hacking and slashing his way through big-titted orc sluts, elven nymphettes and probably some furry fox bitches in keeping with the typical formula. It turns out I was wrong. Semenax.com definitely still falls into a niche, one that may well be of more interest to the random pervert than some homemade hentai for neckbeards. What’s more appealing to you, a cum-based fantasy weapon or a real-life boost in your own ejaculatory power?</p><p></p><p><strong>Semenax is a dietary supplement that aims to make you blow bigger loads with more intensity</strong>. The company that makes the stuff has been in business for nearly twenty years now, and Semenax has been on the market for over a decade. That longevity itself tells you a lot; they’re definitely more established than the sketchy, tweaked-out dude who’s been selling me Viagra and blow behind 7-11. Despite their age, it’s really within the last year that their popularity has exploded. I thought people weren’t getting laid during the pandemic, but it looks like jizz-booster sales are way up. Somebody call Goku, because their visitor levels are over 9,000 a day and stacking up quick.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Wild Orgasmic Contractions, You Say?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>It’s not just the imagery that speaks directly to your testicles and lizard brain. There’s also the all-caps, bold screaming claims about increasing the intensity of orgasms and INCREASE SEMEN VOLUME! Other checkmarked claims at the top of the screen promise <strong>longer orgasms, better orgasm control, and the ability to tease your partner with wild orgasmic contractions</strong>.</p><p></p><p>The dork in the video calls it an “all-natural supplement, designed to take your orgasms to an all-time high.” The commercial runs a little over a minute long, and frankly doesn’t add anything to the conversation except some dude holding the bottle and making the same promises I already heard. Of more interest are the hard numbers listed a little further down the landing page.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Hard Numbers About Hard Dicks</h3><p></p><p></p><p>A couple of the big takeaways from the study were that <strong>Semenax users showed a 20% or more increase in jizz load volume compared to placebo, as well as a higher reporting of orgasm intensity</strong>. I’m genuinely curious about the methodology, because I’m imagining milking machines, sperm scales and automated porno injection systems.</p><p></p><p>The clinical results speak more to me than the happy men all over Semenax.com, posing with their blue-labeled plastic bottles beside testimonial quotes. I’m pretty cynical about that shit, because it’s really fucking common for companies to run a reviews-for-products scheme. People will say anything for a free microwave or bottle of dick pills, even if the product is bunk. I’m not saying Semenax does that, but I’m skeptical about a grinning 21-year-old saying a male enhancement product “completely flipped the game” without first saying he had a medical issue with his ding-a-ling.</p><p></p><p>I am a little more inclined to believe the wrinkly old dudes on the page, just from a reproductive health standpoint. There are elderly dudes bragging about the increase in sensitivity and longevity, talking about how hardcore their cumshots have become, and saying they’re blowing double-sized loads. If true, those are some impressive statements, so I decided to do a little digging to find out what this shit is made out of.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Snake Oil, Truffle Butter or Something Better?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>A couple of ingredients stood out immediately. There’s Epimedium Sagittatum, aka horny goat weed. They’ve been selling this as a boner enhancer for decades, with some research indicating it works like a low-level Viagra. There’s also L-arginine, an amino acid which I can say from experience gives a noticeable boner boost by increasing natural levels of nitric oxide. (I’ve also read a number of people online swearing by a combination of L-arginine and maritime pine bark extract as a natural version of Cialis.)</p><p></p><p>Piggybacking on the L-arginine in Semenax are L-Lysine and L-Carnitine. There’s enough evidence for these two that they’re often recommended to supplement the big-name prescription ED pills. It’s thought they stimulate testosterone production and increase the number of little spermies swimming in your nutsack.</p><p></p><p>Rounding out the formula are Swedish Flower Pollen and Butea Superba, two ingredients with considerably less science to back them up. The pollen is rumored to heal a variety of ailments, including some prostate health benefits, but there aren’t many studies to back it up. Likewise with Butea Superba, which has been taken as a traditional libido booster in Thailand. One study started off with promising results that put it ahead of sildenafil, but by the end of the study, they weren’t able to measure any effects at all.</p><p></p><p>Honestly, to my ears it sounds like a few medically backed ingredients rounded out with a little bit of snake oil. I know that sounds like a poor endorsement, but it ain’t all bad—it’s just a third bad. Packing active ingredients with some lesser constituents is a very common practice, and I feel like Semenax does better than a lot of the competition. Go on Amazon and you’ll find dozens of horny goat weed formulations with the most absurd, bullshit added fillers that definitely don’t do anything. “We traveled around the world to fill these erectile enhancement capsules with Indonesian sawdust, Arabian sand and fresh grave dirt straight from the bayous of Louisiana.”</p><p></p><p></p><h3>So Is It Worth It or Not?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>I clicked my way to the purchase page, and of course, they try to sell me a yearly supply for $400, saying it’s the best value. Well, I’m not dropping any Benjamins on dick pills without trying them first. I learned my lesson the hard way. A month's supply will run you sixty bucks, or about $2 a day.</p><p></p><p>Sixty bucks does sound kind of like a gamble for dick pills, especially when you can get legit Viagra prescribed and shipped for less than half that over at ForHims. (Check out my review here at MissAVDH!) Of course, the intended effects of Semenax are a bit different than Vitamin V. This is ostensibly for bigger loads, not for curing your soft wiener.</p><p></p><p>While Semenax.com does have some quality hype, some strong science and some proven ingredients behind it, <strong>I think the biggest selling point is probably their 67-day money-back guarantee</strong>. In the event it does turn out to be a crock of shit or simply doesn’t work for you, you can return your empty containers for a full refund. While your mileage is going to vary with any type of male enhancement product, this one sounds promising and can be test-driven for a couple of months without any real investment.</p>"}},{"id":"ada66b0824d4","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"ada66b0824d4","title":"ExtenZe Pills","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"BuyExtenZe.com offers great deals and 67-day money-back guarantee free shipping for 21st century’s most popular over-the-counter medicine chicken pills banned in sports","canonical":"https://theporndude.com/zh/18004/extenzepills","affiliate_url":"https://www.buyextenze.com/","rating":4,"siteOrder":4,"price":"free","tags":["免费"],"features":[],"categories":[{"id":"male-enhancement-pills","collection":"categories_en"}],"screenshot_url":"https://cdn.staticstack.net/assets/img/r-thumbs/5fc6d28-extenzepills_small.png","image_alt":"ExtenZe Pills, Aphrodisiac","scraped_at":"2025-10-28T22:15:06.219Z","iconSpritesheet":"custom-favicon-spritesheet.png","iconPosition":"-400px -832px","iconClassName":"ctm-icon18004","logoIconClass":"icon18004","pros":["male enhancement pills","proven ingredients","bigger, more frequent boners","increased endurance","no prescription necessary","the company once snuck real viagra into their products","banned in most pro sports","sweet bulk deals","free shipping","67-day money-back guarantee"],"cons":["the company once snuck real viagra into their products","banned in most pro sports"],"detailedDescription":"<p>These days, it really ain’t difficult to buy ExtenZe on the internet. Dick pills used to be something you had to score from the seediest truck stops or your sketchiest friend, but we’re living in a modern era of VR porn, local hookup apps and instant boners. ExtenZe has an interesting and controversial reputation, but I don’t think they would have been around this long if it was all sheer bullshit. In fact, some of the things I tell you in this review might have you reaching for your credit card despite what you might have heard.</p><p></p><p>Yes, my horny friends, BuyExtenZe.com is exactly what it sounds like, an online shop with nothing for sale but <strong>what might be the most popular non-prescription dick pill of the 21st century</strong>. The supplement is widely available due to its longstanding brand recognition, but the website on the other end of my link does offer some little perks and deals you don’t get at Walgreens. Regardless of where you get it, I bet you’re wondering whether it’s worth the price. Well, let me tell you what I know.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Let’s Talk About the Controversies First</h3><p></p><p></p><p>This whole writeup about BuyExtenZe would sound fishy as fuck if I didn’t mention the controversies, of which there were a few. Back in 2006, they had to pay some civil penalties for claiming the pills gave users a 27% bigger dick. They’ve since ditched the hard digits and just promise “bigger, harder, more frequent erections” on the BuyExtenze website. The Orange County district attorney didn’t come after them for the revamped claim, which suggests that it does increase size, at least to some extent.</p><p></p><p>Another major controversy happened in 2018, and it’s kind of a funny one. <strong>They actually got busted putting legit sildenafil, the active ingredient in Viagra, in their ExtenZe Plus tabs</strong>. I know there are a lot of dudes out there, perhaps the more responsible ones, who read that and think, “I’d better stay away from that sketchy company!” I know it says a lot about me that I had entirely the opposite reaction. “Viagra without a script? Hook me up!”</p><p></p><p>The sildenafil controversy is one that you can read as a negative or a positive, as is this next one I’m going to tell you about. One of the active ingredients in <strong>ExtenZe is banned as a performance-enhancing drug in most professional athletic settings</strong>. The chem in question is dehydroepiandrosterone, better known as DHEA. According to the Olympics, the World Anti-Doping Agency, the NCAA, the NFL and the NBA, it just makes you too fucking good at performing. What can I say? I love to give the ladies a show!</p><p></p><p></p><h3>More Than a Dozen Boner Enhancers in One</h3><p></p><p></p><p>I’m not going to go over the whole Buy ExtenZe formula here. They’ve included some basic constituents like niacin, zinc and folic acid, though I’m guessing most of the action comes from the more exotic ingredients. They’re <strong>proven to help a dude out</strong>, and a few of them I’ve actually tried before: maca makes me horny, but you usually have to eat tablespoons of the powder; yohimbe extract seems to make my dick harder, but too much gives me a headache; l-arginine hydrochloride gives me good bike rides and juicier boners; horny goat weed has a chemical that’s very similar to prescription sildenafil, though not as strong.</p><p></p><p>If you Buy ExtenZe, you don’t have to pop dozens of different capsules a day, but that’s only part of the convenience. By combining a little of this and a little of that, they’re stacking the effects while minimizing the side effects of taking too much of any one substance. That yohimbe headache ain’t going to come on since I’m not slamming handfuls of it anymore.</p><p></p><p>It's worth mentioning here that ExtenZe ain’t exactly an instant erection pill a la Viagra or those suspicious supplements behind the counter at the neighborhood sex shop. They recommend taking the pill every day as part of your routine, which builds the levels of all those ingredients in your body. This leads to <strong>bigger, more frequent boners and increased endurance</strong>. The checkpoints listed at the top of BuyExtenZe also mention “massive intense and electrifying orgasms,” but come on, those just come free with any rock-solid hard-on.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>So You Wanna Buy ExtenZe or What?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>You get free shipping, too, which means you don’t have to sheepishly hand your penis-embiggening pills to the cute, giggling teenage girl behind the counter at the local drug store. There’s no shame in it, my dudes, but I understand not wanting to let the world know what’s going on in the privacy of your bedroom. Personally? You can peek in on the privacy of my bedroom over at MissAVDHCasting. I hope your cock is raging hard while you watch, and I’ve heard of a supplement that can help in that department…</p><p></p><p>Best of all, <strong>they offer a 67-day money-back guarantee</strong>. To me, this is the best reason to use BuyExtenZe instead of getting your fix somewhere else. You get a couple months to test it out and see if it does what you want it to. If you ain’t satisfied, you get your money back, minus the usual shipping and handling fees. This ain’t a gamble. Not even your family physician can offer that can kind of guarantee.</p><p></p><p>ExtenZe might not have the same reputation as the heavy pharmaceuticals pushed by the most well-connected and billionaire-funded drug dealers in the world, but there’s a reason people are still popping it decades after it hit the market. Maybe the gimmick really is as simple as an OTC boner pill that actually does come through on its promises of firmer shafts and more satisfied wives. There’s no shortage of rip-offs aimed at horny dudes, though you never seem to see those other brands more than a time or two before they disappear forever. If you’ve been wondering about this one, BuyExtenZe.com will let you try it without the risk.</p>"}},{"id":"257f43a6e406","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"257f43a6e406","title":"11Oysters","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"11Oysters.com Concentrate the power of oysters and other safe all-natural ingredients in a slice of peppermint for 48 hours Better erections last longer and faster","canonical":"https://theporndude.com/zh/18791/11oysters","affiliate_url":"https://www.11oysters.com/candy/5/","rating":4,"siteOrder":5,"price":"free","tags":[],"features":[],"categories":[{"id":"male-enhancement-pills","collection":"categories_en"}],"screenshot_url":"https://cdn.staticstack.net/assets/img/r-thumbs/97e33_11oysters_small.jpg","image_alt":"11Oysters, Aphrodisiac","scraped_at":"2025-10-28T22:15:11.232Z","iconSpritesheet":"custom-favicon-spritesheet.png","iconPosition":"-192px -864px","iconClassName":"ctm-icon18791","logoIconClass":"icon18791","pros":["premium male enhancement candy","no prescription necessary","range of exotic natural ingredients","no side effects","works in 30 minutes, lasts 48 hours","boosts energy, enhances blood flow, increases performance and stamina","free shipping","60-day satisfaction guarantee"],"cons":["as with anything, results may vary"],"detailedDescription":"<p>What’s better than shucking and slurping down a dozen oysters before banging your wife? 11 Oysters sounds better from a convenience perspective even if you love seafood, but this next product promises all the benefits of a platter full of slippery bivalves in one little candy. In case you’re wondering, it doesn’t even taste like raw mollusks on the half shell, so it’ll leave your dirty mouth minty fresh instead of smelling like the ocean. Say what you will about the aphrodisiac qualities of the humble oyster, but women in general ain’t crazy about making out with a stank-ass fish mouth.</p><p></p><p><strong>11Oysters.com describes their mints as a “premium male enhancement candy”</strong>. It’s a dudely health supplement in a sweet, chewable format, kind of like those Flintstones vitamins some of you remember, but designed to keep you raging hard and ready. It hasn’t been on the market too long, but the brains behind it started developing the formula years ago. I’m always curious about products designed to enhance sex, seeing as I review porn websites all week and bang a weekly pornstar at MissAVDHCasting. Without any further ado, let’s see what this little treat’s all about.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Do Oysters Really Set the Mood?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Oysters as aphrodisiacs are a somewhat controversial topic. People have used them for hundreds of years to get in the mood, but skeptics will tell you it’s all bullshit. Internet naysayers love to shit on anything people are into, and honestly, the science is a little mixed. There haven’t really been a lot of studies that prove conclusively that oysters have a sensual effect, but certain ingredients in them absolutely do.</p><p></p><p>Oysters are high in zinc, for one thing, which can help boost testosterone and dopamine. There’s also D-aspartic acid, another testosterone supporter, and omega-3 fats, which may help boost blood flow, a critical component of rock-hard boners. I’ve seen it suggested that the weird, cummy texture of the things help get you in the mood by making you think of sex, but that’s harder to prove than the chemical elements.</p><p></p><p>11Oysters says each of their mints “concentrate the essence of 11 oysters from the Strait of Malacca”, but there’s no further breakdown of the constituents I mentioned. The formula ain’t limited to slightly less than a dozen oysters, though. <strong>They include a range of exotic natural ingredients</strong>, some familiar, and others that I’ve never seen available in a men’s supplement before.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>A Natural Witch’s Brew for Your Dick</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Red ginseng is also included. Ginseng comes in various forms, and they’re all very common in supplements of all types. As with oysters, ginseng has its detractors, but also has a long history of human use and a whole shitload of people who still swear by it. It’s an adaptogen, meaning it’s kind of good for everything in theory, so 11 Oysters offers it up to help boost antioxidant production, boosting endurance and enhancing libidos.</p><p></p><p>Ever tried deer antler? I haven’t before now, but 11Oysters rolls it into the formula for its sex-hormone precursors to testosterone. The mantis egg cases are purported to decease premature ejaculation and also get you horny “by nourishing kidney essence.” Male silkworm eggs are supposed to treat impotence, boost androgen secretion, and increase sperm motility.</p><p></p><p>They round out the ingredients with epidium, cynomortium songaricum, cusctua chinensis and morinda, which serve similar purposes. Everything is listed with a little thumbnail image of the various herbs and spices, and for the most part, it all looks like stuff you’d find in the forest or the health food store. Since it’s all safe and natural, <strong>11Oysters promises no side effects</strong>. You ain’t going to get that at ForHims!</p><p></p><p></p><h3>But How Does It Actually Work?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>It's not exactly herbal Viagra, though, so the effects don’t exactly hit you the same way. One thing I really like about this product is that <strong>the effects last up for 48 hours</strong>. A box of 11Oysters contains 28 candies, and that’s supposed to last you a couple months. Contrast that to the monthly packages you sign up for with a lot of the competitors. The website even offers up a chart showing just how 11Oysters compares to the other guys in terms of pricing and dosing frequency.</p><p></p><p>I know I’ve already mentioned Viagra a couple paragraphs in a row, but I’ve just got to comment on the visuals. The photo of the product on the front page of 11Oysters.com sure as hell looks like a Vitamin V breath mint, which I assume was an intentional branding thing. The speckled texture and oblong shape look like candy, but lose your glasses and you might really think it was a prescription dick pill.</p><p></p><p>As far as specific effects, the 11 Oysters website lists three: <strong>it boosts natural energy, enhances blood circulation, and improves performance and stamina</strong>. There’s also an obvious confidence boost that comes with all this, which will go a long way in keeping that pecker in working order. I don’t mean to sound like a cynic, but the placebo effect is how a lot of the bullshit gas station boner pills work, at least when they’re not straight-up poisoning you.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Mantis Eggs with a Money-Back Guarantee</h3><p></p><p></p><p>They do soften the financial blow in a couple ways, though. For one thing, <strong>they offer free shipping around the world</strong>. It’s a pretty standard perk these days, but still worth mentioning since I hate seeing an extra charge as much you do.</p><p></p><p><strong>They also offer a 60-day satisfaction guarantee</strong>. Basically, you just email them, send the product back and get your money back. You’re still on the hook for shipping costs and a little bit of your time, but hey, nobody is offering this kind of guarantee on pharmaceuticals. It takes most of the risk out of trying the product if you’re still on the fence.</p><p></p><p>11Oysters.com is easiest to recommend if you’re already a believer in the sensual properties of oysters, as they’ve made it the main, titular ingredient in their little magic potion pills. Like I said in the intro, chewing up a mint is a hell of a lot faster, easier, and nicer on your breath than crushing a whole plate full of raw, jiggling mollusks. They round out the formula with a range of safe, all-natural ingredients with a history of aphrodisiacal use, boosting your circulation, size, stamina and pleasure. Even if you ain’t convinced about the oyster thing yet, the money-back guarantee lets you see firsthand just how effective their candies are without burning through your wallet.

I could sure use some built-in delay time when it comes to shit like filing my taxes, hopping on a Zoom meeting or getting to the bar before my Tinder date changes her mind. As a professional masturbator and the dick-slinging stud of MissAVDHCasting, I’m sure you can imagine some other delays I might want to build into my routine, and you might have some of the same concerns about your gametime. Well, my dudes, this product is aimed at addressing those very needs.</p><p></p><p>VigRXDelaySpray.com hawks exactly what it says on the tin: <strong>it’s a spray that delays ejaculation so you can enjoy that sweet thrusting and pumping longer</strong>. It’s not a new concept, and you know what else? It ain’t a new company, either. The guys making this stuff have been in business since the dawn of the new millennium, which gives them a lot more credibility than the fly-by-night dick-pill websites spamming up the free tubes. I’m always looking for ways to enhance my fuck sessions and masturbatory marathons, so let’s take a closer look at what they’re selling.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Neither a Truck Stop nor a Pharmacist</h3><p></p><p></p><p>A handful of bullet points at the top of the screen reiterate the main feature of VigRX Delay Spray. You’ll last longer in bed, watch her cum, extend her pleasure and have an amazing sex life if the ad copy is to be believed, and <strong>it all starts working in just ten minutes</strong>. If you’ve played around with any sex-enhancing chemicals before, you know how much of a pain in the ass it can be to get the timing right. “Has the pill kicked in yet, honey? Can we do it now? My pussy’s drying up.”</p><p></p><p>Most of the front page just repeats itself in different terms, but there are some noteworthy features. It’s dose-dependent for one, so you can use twice as much for twice the effect. They say it’s consistent, meaning you shouldn’t have that honeymoon effect like those really good drugs you used to buy in college. I’ll get into the science of it all shortly, but the main ingredient is totally non-habit forming and the effects won’t diminish with use.</p><p></p><p>You’ve probably already guessed this part, but <strong>you don’t need a prescription to get it</strong>. You can order direct from VigRXDelaySpray without ever having to tell your physician that your wife is way out of your league and makes you cum too fast, let alone show doc your dick. Some of the other dick-med and boner-supplement shops on the web want you to go have a real in-person penis inspection before they even let you talk to their online doctors, which seems like it defeats the purpose. This is much easier and a million times less embarrassing.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>What’s Really in VigRX Delay Spray?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Really, I knew how this stuff was going to work as soon as I read about that ten-minute activation time. <strong>You spritz this fluid directly on your junk</strong>. The recommended dose is one to three sprays, and they say that’ll typically keep you going a good 20 to 30 minutes.</p><p></p><p>How’s it work? That’s pretty simple, too. It’s a topical anesthetic, literally the same as what your dentist uses on your gums before he pulls a tooth, or what they put in anal lubes so that monster cock doesn’t hurt so bad up your butthole. The FAQ says that <strong>VigRXDelaySpray uses benzocaine while most products use the inferior lidocaine</strong>, which is kind of true. Some of the biggest drugstore brands like KY list lidocaine as the active ingredient, but benzocaine ain’t quite as rare a treatment as they’re claiming. My local Walgreens carries a benzocaine-based gel called Mandelay, a brand I always remember because of that fan-fucking-tastic name.</p><p></p><p>The VigRXDelaySpray.com actually acknowledges the existence of these other products, going as far as saying benzocaine has been used as an “endurance condom” for decades. According to the website’s Science section, they’ve enhanced the formula in some nebulous way. “But while benzocaine has been used for this purpose since the early 2000s,” they write, “our scientists have managed to tweak this nifty sex extender in a convenient delay spray for our customers.”</p><p></p><p>If you do your own homework on Google or Reddit, you’re not going to find any consensus about which topical anesthetic is better for premature ejaculation. Most users and doctors seem to think of them as roughly equal in terms of effectivity, with more preferences when it comes to how the products are meant to be applied. I think a squirt from a bottle is much more convenient that lubing myself up from a tube, but that’s just me. I found a few more reports of irritation from lidocaine than benzocaine, though it’s an uncommon side effect and typically affects people using a ton of the stuff.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>If You Don’t Like It, Don’t Pay For It</h3><p></p><p></p><p>The price tags are higher here than on those drugstore products with the lidocaine, even if you spring for a bundle. Unlike the stuff that’ll get you giggled at by the girl behind the counter at CVS, though, <strong>VigRXDelaySpray comes with a 67-day money-back guarantee</strong>. It looks like you have to buy at least two bottles to qualify, and you’re still on the line for shipping charges. Does this mean shipping ain’t free if you don’t like the product?</p><p></p><p>My one small complaint is that it ain’t exactly clear how much you get in each bottle. It’s 50 ml or 1.7 oz of juice and that’s supposed to last you a month, but how often do they assume I fuck, and how many sprays do they presume I’ll need? I do appreciate that the money-back guarantee extends to packages you may have purchased on top of the two-month supply, which potentially gives you a little more room to experiment with your own personal dosage.</p><p></p><p>VigRXDelaySpray.com ain’t selling something entirely new, but they have tweaked a time-tested treatment for premature ejaculation. I think the format is the best part of the product, because the spray bottle eliminates the need for slathering your hands in numbing agent and then smearing it all over your pecker. Just pump that bottle a time or three and you’re ready to rock out with your cock out, without disappointing your wife yet again and then crying about it in the bathroom. Don’t sleep on that money-back guarantee, which takes the risk out of forking over your money. What have you got to lose, besides all those extra minutes humping away?</p>"}},{"id":"37f9428c3b39","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"37f9428c3b39","title":"HerSolution","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"HerSolution.com provides daily supplements for women with low sexual desire to improve vaginal dryness and increase sexual desire to enjoy more sex","canonical":"https://theporndude.com/zh/18005/hersolution","affiliate_url":"https://www.hersolution.com/","rating":4,"siteOrder":7,"price":"free","tags":[],"features":[],"categories":[{"id":"male-enhancement-pills","collection":"categories_en"}],"screenshot_url":"https://cdn.staticstack.net/assets/img/r-thumbs/f02556b-hersolution_small.png","image_alt":"HerSolution, Aphrodisiac","scraped_at":"2025-10-28T22:15:25.300Z","iconSpritesheet":"custom-favicon-spritesheet.png","iconPosition":"-416px -832px","iconClassName":"ctm-icon18005","logoIconClass":"icon18005","pros":["daily libido-boosting supplement for women","naturally restores desire for sex","100% natural formula","no prescription required","gentle formula - no known side effects","67-day guarantee","free shipping"],"cons":["not recommended for pregnant women"],"detailedDescription":"<p>Her Solution has such a vague name that it’s almost ominous, because it doesn’t suggest what she even needs a solution to. Is the woman referenced in the title tired of getting up early for work, bored with the dinners she’s been cooking, or having trouble getting excited when those Tinder dates tick up into the late-night hours? You’re reading this on MissAVDH, so I bet you can nail this multiple-choice question. Maybe later, you can get nailed—and enjoy the hell out of yourself while you’re at it.</p><p></p><p>The problem we’re talking about today is low libido in ladies, and the solution? HerSolution.com hawks <strong>a daily supplement to help make women hornier, wetter, and more ready for action</strong>. The company’s been around since the early ‘00s, which suggests some expertise and experience delivering on their claims. There are a lot of bullshit health products out there, as you already know if your sister-in-law fell for an MLM scam, so let’s look at a brand that’s actually had what it takes to stick around.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Finally, Something for the Ladies</h3><p></p><p></p><p>It's kind of sad that women have been neglected in the same respect, though it’s got a historical basis. Hell, Western culture considered the female orgasm a myth until fairly recently, and there are still boneheads who don’t think women need to get off. Seeing as I’m writing to the women today, I know I don’t have to tell you that. My buddies sometimes tell me the most embarrassing shit about their hookups…</p><p></p><p>Fluctuations in libido are common for everybody—male, female or otherwise—so don’t beat yourself up if you just haven’t been feeling it lately. Her Solution offers a bullet-pointed list of reasons you might have for feeling that way, but it’s nowhere near exhaustive. Diet, exercise, stress and those usual womanly cycles can wreak havoc on your desire to get off.</p><p></p><p>HerSolution ain’t going to improve your fitness routine or make you cut down on the Taco Bell, but the ingredients are formulated to <strong>“gently and naturally restore your desire for and enjoyment of sex”</strong>. In some ways, it’s a better approach than Viagra, which just helps make more blood flow available to the pecker. This is more of a holistic method meant to increase a woman’s overall health, particularly in ways that are going to help out in the bedroom.</p><p></p><p>Just like Viagra ain’t an instant boner without stimulation, Her Solution doesn’t just instantly make your pussy wet for no reason. You’ll still need that basic stimulation to get you going, but your body will be more receptive and ready to roll. It’s a little like taking your car into the shop for regular maintenance, only it’s as simple as popping a pill in the morning, and nobody’s trying to hustle you into paying for new blinker fluid.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>What Is Her Solution, Exactly?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Let’s go over those ingredients. They’ve included niacin, which is listed as B3 in energy drinks. Not only does it give you a little pep in your step, but it’s a vasodilator that improves circulation; it’s been proven to work for male libido issues for the same reason. The vitamin is critical for all kinds of bodily functions, and is believed to help produce estrogen, progesterone and testosterone. You know, the sex hormones.</p><p></p><p>They’ve also got hops extracts. I associate hops with beer and knew they’re sometimes used if you’re having trouble sleeping, but I didn’t know they’re supposed to help with vaginal dryness, too. Well, not directly anyhow, if my tips to the local watering hole are any evidence. Hops are also known for helping boost estrogen production.</p><p></p><p>There’s ginkgo biloba, an adaptogen your hippy friends might take for literally everything, included here for the blood-flow effects on your sex parts. Mucuna pruriens seeds are another ancient ingredient, used for millennia in ayurvedic medicine and more recently proven to provide dopamine precursor L-Dopa. Epimedium sagitattum has only been used for a measly thousand years, but seems to improve nitric oxide levels like prescription Vitamin V, allowing more blood flow and stimulation to the clit.</p><p></p><p>HerSolution’s last ingredient surprised me, because it’s just regular ol’ cayenne pepper. No shit, it can actually improve blood flow and help increase vaginal lubrication. They don’t mention it on the HerSolution.com website, but a couple other sources online say cayenne may also help reduce pain from getting pounded by an oversized dong.</p><p></p><p>All in all, it’s a very gentle formula. The front page of HerSolution claims there are <strong>No Known Side Effects</strong>, a claim that I’d be skeptical of if I hadn’t gone over the whole ingredient list myself. I Googled everything they’ve baked into their pills, and it really is some of the safest shit out there. Niacin can cause a niacin flush if you take too much, turning your skin briefly red, but you have to slam a couple of those truck-stop energy shots to consume enough to make that happen.</p><p></p><p>That said, Her Solution is not recommended for pregnant women. Their FAQ says some women report their boobs getting a little bigger as the herbs and spices balance out their hormones. If you’ve got any serious health concerns, you should probably consult somebody whose professional experience ain’t solely in the realm of pornography. I’m just here to help get everybody hornier.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Wet Pussies, Guarantees and Freebies</h3><p></p><p></p><p>They also offer <strong>a 67-day money-back guarantee</strong>, but you’ve got to buy at least a two-month supply to qualify. They want you to send your unused portion back and you’ll be out the shipping costs, but that’s nothing when you consider the potential upsides. I know I might sound like a biased pervert since you’re reading this on an adult website, but libido issues can be absolutely disastrous for your personal life and mental health.</p><p></p><p><strong>You also get a free gift if you buy more than one pack of Her Solution</strong>. The freebie is a one-month supply of HerSolution Gel, a product designed to work hand-in-hand with the HerSolution tabs. It’s another natural formula, this time designed to tackle that dryness directly. I’m going to write about the gel next, so if you’re curious, check out my other review here at MissAVDH.</p><p></p><p>While men are constantly encouraged to max out their erectile hardness, women just don’t get as much attention when it comes to issues like low libido and vaginal dryness. HerSolution.com offers a real solution, going well beyond the usual platitudes like, “Maybe you just need a nice bath and a better man.” The formula is all natural and gentle, designed to optimize that reproductive system of yours, regardless of what you’re planning on using it for. The money-back guarantee takes the risk out of testing it out, making it an easy recommendation for women looking for a soft, easy solution to this particular problem.</p>"}},{"id":"317f7cf41efc","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"317f7cf41efc","title":"HerSolutionGel","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"HerSolutionGel.com sells more than just another water-based lubricant that reduces vaginal dryness and increases stimulation and enjoys life orgasm for free","canonical":"https://theporndude.com/zh/18006/hersolutiongel","affiliate_url":"https://www.hersolutiongel.com/","rating":4,"siteOrder":8,"price":"free","tags":["免费"],"features":[],"categories":[{"id":"male-enhancement-pills","collection":"categories_en"}],"screenshot_url":"https://cdn.staticstack.net/assets/img/r-thumbs/fade54f-hersolutiongel_small.png","image_alt":"HerSolutionGel, Aphrodisiac","scraped_at":"2025-10-28T22:15:30.359Z","iconSpritesheet":"custom-favicon-spritesheet.png","iconPosition":"-432px -832px","iconClassName":"ctm-icon18006","logoIconClass":"icon18006","pros":["sex-enhancing gel for women","reduces vaginal dryness","improves sexual stimulation","100% all-natural formula","free shipping","67-day money-back guarantee","free hersolution tablets"],"cons":["pricier than regular ol’ sex lube"],"detailedDescription":"<p>If you think Her Solution Gel sounds like a euphemism for a lady’s natural lube, well, you ain’t far off. In fact, the stuff is designed to help out if you’re having a little trouble getting the juices flowing on your own. No, it’s not some basic-ass KY knockoff to let your man slip inside when you’re not in the mood, but something even better. The improved wetness is just one of its benefits.</p><p></p><p>HerSolutionGel.com is home to the titular product, <strong>a gel designed to lube you up, make you hornier, and increase your level of sexual stimulation</strong>. It’s something that would feel at home on the shelf at the local drug store as well as the local porn store, because it takes a healthy, holistic approach to getting you in the mood for some naughty business. I’ve been hearing some hype about this sex-enhancing goo lately, so I figured I’d better look into it and report back to you guys. Here’s what I found.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Where’d These Guys Even Come From?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>I do love the way the daytime-tube medical professional says it “maximizes engorgement of the clitoris” as he’s rattling off the features. The rules about saying sexy shit on network TV are weird, but I guess it’s okay to use that kind of language as long as it’s in a medical or crime context—never in comedy or drama. The female host then explains how you massage the product onto your clit, and how “that would probably stimulate most women.”</p><p></p><p>I have to give HerSolutionGel.com credit for including that clip on the website, because it sort of undersells the stuff by making it sound like a joke. The truth is that, yes, it does help out in the same obvious ways as any personal lubricant, but that’s just the most immediate effect. I’ll get into the details of just how it works in a minute here, but your sensations are going to be leveled up throughout your whole fuck sesh, from the gel application to the mind-boggling orgasm you earn at the end.</p><p></p><p>Much of the front page talks about the how and why of vagina dryness and low libido, which I imagine most of you have already done some Google homework on. They offer up a bullet-pointed list of reasons, like smoking, pregnancy, stress and lack of sleep, but I think one of the overarching points is just that it’s not an uncommon condition. There’s no reason to feel ashamed of it, and there’s certainly no reason not to look for a solution--perhaps even HerSolution Gel.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>What’s in HerSolution Gel?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>They list L-arginine first, which didn’t come as a surprise. The amino acid is widely used in products for both male and female libido because it relaxes blood vessels and lets more of the red stuff flow into the naughty bits. No shit, I’ve actually taken straight L-arginine caps, and they offer a more noticeable improvement that most off-brand OTC boner pills.</p><p></p><p>There’s silky, smooth and slippery aloe for obvious reasons, along with shea and cocoa butters. A bit of olive squalene helps soften vaginal tissue and prevent moisture loss, while triethanolamine stabilizes pH levels to keep irritation at bay. Yeah, I know: that last one doesn’t sound quite as 100% natural as HerSolution Gel claims, but I Googled it. Triethanolamine is made in a lab, but it’s safe enough that it’s used in all sorts of cosmetics and medicines. Oh, and it’s also useful for making cement, giving a whole new meaning to having an ass like a dump truck.</p><p></p><p>The ingredients in Her Solution Gel work as a sort of a catalyst to your body’s own natural systems, jump starting everything and giving it all a little boost along the way. As your wetness increases and your clit gets fatter, your sensations and stimulation increase. This, in turn, continues to keep you moist and engorged, and so on and so forth. I believe this is what they call the Circle of Life.</p><p></p><p>The HerSolutionGel website really wants to hammer it home that these ingredients are doctor approved, and not just those scrubs-wearing dudes on the Dr. Phil spinoff. It’s paraben-free, unlike a lot of other products out there. Vaginas don’t have the same protection as the skin on the rest of your body, so it’s even more important to keep that toxic shit away.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>HerSolution Gel and a Free Gift, Too</h3><p></p><p></p><p>You’re probably going to want to buy at least two boxes, though, and I’ll tell you why. <strong>Her Solution Gel comes with a 67-day money-back guarantee</strong>, but only if you buy at least two packs. The price starts dropping as you go bigger, too; two tubes are $95, six are a couple hundo. The guarantee applies to your whole order, so don’t be afraid to stock up. If you’re unhappy, send everything back in a couple months and get your money back.</p><p></p><p>It gets better, too. If you order at least two packages of the gel, <strong>you also get a free one-month supply of HerSolution tablets</strong>. I’ve got a separate writeup about the pills here at MissAVDH if you want to learn more, but it’s a daily supplement designed to work hand in hand with Her Solution Gel. The gel gets you ready right now, while the caps gently optimize your body for endless hours of hardcore humping and big-ass big O’s.</p><p></p><p>Both of these products, the gel and tablets, are made by the same cGMP pharmaceuticals lab used by brands like Wal-Mart to make your grandma’s meds. If you’re a regular consumer of supplements, you already know why that’s a big deal. There are so many sketchy little fly-by-night outfits out there putting out herbal pills contaminated with talc, heavy metals and who knows what else. If you think I’m bullshitting just to make Her Solution Gel sound better, Google it for yourself; the lowest estimate I can find for contamination in supplements is 12%!</p><p></p><p>What do you want to put in your body—besides your boyfriend’s big dick, I mean? Heavy-duty pharmaceuticals with toxic side effects, or something with safe, time-tested botanical ingredients? Personally, I think the medical route should be reserved for later, if you find that the cheaper, safer, money-back-guaranteed alternatives don’t work for you. HerSolutionGel is one such alternative, and it’s hard to argue with some of the perks they’re offering.</p><p></p><p>If you’re curious whether or not this is the product for you, I’d recommend taking advantage of that sweet guarantee. Between the money-back offer and the gentle, natural ingredients, there’s really no reason not to try HerSolutionGel.com if you’ve been experiencing any issues with vaginal dryness, or just want to see if the gel really makes sex better than the lube you bought on Amazon. All you’ve really got to lose is a few bucks for shipping if it doesn’t do the trick.</p>"}}]

Pretty much everything I review here at MissAVDH is spicy, and vanilla in this business has certain connotations outside of ice cream varieties. Truthfully, I sometimes use the flavor as a semi-insult, pushing content out of the kinkiest places and into the more sexual basics of your parents’ bedroom. My Spicy Vanilla might be a treat at the local gastropub, but my immediate thought was just how freaky it would be on an adult website: mild, medium, or extra-hot?</p><p></p><p>Based on the traffic MySpicyVanilla.com is pulling shortly after launch, I’m guessing it leans toward the naughtier stuff. <strong>The site uses AI to help you craft the sexy stories of your wettest dreams</strong>. Can over a million visitors a month be wrong? Sure, it happens, but I’ve found there’s usually at least some wisdom in the horny crowds. With that in mind, I decided to feed the machine some of my own dirty thoughts and see what pops out.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Welcome to the Future of AI Smut</h3><p></p><p></p><p>I’ve always been into porn stories in part because the brain really is one of our sexiest organs, and because of the sheer variety of the stuff, often incorporating fetishes and sex acts rarely featured on the big paysites, if ever. MySpicyVanilla looks at a glance like a nicer porn story archive, with a cute little logo and some clean, professional iconography out on the front page. Of the handful of AI story writers I’ve reviewed so far, it’s easily got the most polished and inviting presentation.</p><p></p><p>The tour-page hype reads well, with bullet points of features and brags about mentions by Fox, ABC, NBC and other news outlets. My only real complaint is a minor one, but I feel like some sample stories would help users get their creative juices flowing as well as offer some immediate insights into the quality of the material MySpicyVanilla.com is creating. Fortunately, <strong>there is a free trial, and it’s fairly generous</strong>.</p><p></p><p>Free users get a bonus story as soon as they sign up, and can generate another story or another chapter every 24 hours. They do cut you off after 10 freebies, but if you’ve ever had a story commissioned by a real, human erotica wordsmith, I’m sure you can already see the value. The limit for free chapters is a thousand words, which could easily cost you a couple Benjamins if you hired a guy off Reddit.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Co-Write Your Great Porn Novel for Almost Nothing</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Subscribers get better memory, which is vital for longer yarns, and a boosted maximum word count of 4000 words. You also get improved prompt length and AI model quality, unlimited story characters, arcs and locations, advanced customization and better visuals that include erotic images. You also get AI editing assistance with your membership, which beats the hell out of paying a freelancer some extra money because your instructions weren’t quite specific enough to begin with. Speaking as a guy who’s done this kind of writing in the past, unclear instructions were the absolute fucking bane of my existence, but the robot doesn’t give a shit. It won’t include subtle jokes at your expense, which I totally would.</p><p></p><p><strong>My Spicy Vanilla can also generate audiobooks with some of the best AI voices I’ve heard yet</strong>. The front-page sample about a gal in a curve-hugging dress really sounds passably human, a major step up from even the better fake voices on the AI chat apps I’ve been reviewing lately. It's kind of ironic that I’m hearing them first in a less popular niche, though I certainly ain’t complaining. If anything, it’s an enticement to get the virtual sexters to come give this service a shot, too.</p><p></p><p>And here’s what I think of as the small catch to the membership. The daily pass gets you a free audio credit, but you only get two per month with the regular subscription. It makes sense, given the increased resource demands for any kind of multimedia, and especially given the crazy quality of those synthesized voices. As with other AI sites, you may end up needing to pump some more quarters into the machine, but overall, I think the prices are fucking fantastic. Ten bucks will buy you five credits, but you get a better deal at the other end of the scale at 20 for $25; premium users get double credits for the same price.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Sleek, Easy and Absurdly Lifelike</h3><p></p><p></p><p><strong>MySpicyVanilla.com’s machine took just a couple minutes to bring my story to life, and lifelike it is</strong>! The opening paragraph sets the stage in my futuristic, sci-fi apartment with Blade Runner trappings, and I love how they start integrating my details right from the beginning. “MissAVDH lay sprawled across it, his oversized head resting on a pile of plush pillows, his snoring a rhythmic, almost comical rumble. His giant frame was barely contained by the bed, his big shoes still on, toes peeking out from under the blanket.”</p><p></p><p>Julia sneaks into my window “with the grace of a predator,” wakes me up and tells me she’s got something I’m going to love. One of my biggest questions going in was just how dirty MySpicyVanilla would get, and they did not disappoint in that respect. “With a slow, teasing motion, he pulled back the blanket, revealing his massive, throbbing erection. Julia’s breath caught in her throat as she took in the sight, her cheeks flushing with heat. She had heard the rumors, but seeing it in person was something else entirely.”</p><p></p><p><strong>This is the first AI smut generator I’ve used that can generate pics, including erotic imagery</strong>. The one at the top of my tale features a guy and a gal in their underwear in a sci-fi apartment, though they didn’t include my giant head and oversized shoes.</p><p></p><p>My Spicy Vanilla story is now listed under My Stories in the Spicy section, and the machine helpfully tagged it with Voyeurism, Oral Sex, Exhibitionism, Anal and Size Difference. That automatic tagging will be really fucking useful to anybody who’s building their own collection of custom porn stories, ensuring nothing gets lost in the shuffle when you’re in a certain mood.</p><p></p><p>MySpicyVanilla.com is my favorite AI-powered porn story machine so far. The quality of the writing is realistic and titillating enough to make me feel for the real writers whose business it’s going to cut into, and the platform has a better feature set than other sites in the niche. You can generate pics to go with your stories, and the instant audiobooks sound so good you might forget it’s actually a robot rattling off those sweet nothings and filthy fantasies. The trial is generous, so go write a free story and see how excited you get about it.</p>"}},{"id":"d4e506630008","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"d4e506630008","title":"RedQuill","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"RedQuill.net is a pornographic literature website powered by artificial intelligence.

Wattpad sluts, rise and fucking shine. All those years you spent furiously rubbing one out to barely-legal werewolf bad boys and Harry Styles with demon wings? It’s been leading to this. RedQuill.net is your new digital confessional booth where the depraved thoughts in your filthy little mind finally get immortalized in literature—courtesy of an AI that doesn’t judge, doesn’t shame, and sure as shit doesn’t flinch. You want your erotic fantasy about Freddy Krueger and Garfield in a sloppy spooning match on top of a haunted pinball machine? Type it in, bitch. RedQuill’s AI doesn’t blink. It eats it up and spits it back at you, dripping in sweat, cum, and questionable grammar. And here’s the kicker—it’s actually good. Better than 90% of the crap you’ll find on AO3 where every smut story starts with “she bit her lip” like that’s the clitoris detonator. No, RedQuill doesn’t play coy. This site lets your most depraved, post-nut regrets take form like you’re the digital Shakespeare of smut.</p><p></p><p>This is your personal brothel of words, a self-serve kink buffet, and the only safe space where wanting to get railed by an anthropomorphic chair doesn’t land you in a psych ward. RedQuill gets you. It cradles your degeneracy with the softness of a thousand porno tissues and says, “It’s okay, baby. Let’s write about your dick getting stuck in a vending machine again.” There’s no kink too cursed, no character pairing too sacrilegious. Want Pikachu pegging Jesus? Slap it in the box and watch literary hell break loose. If it exists in your head, it can exist in RedQuill. This is the fanfic fallout shelter. The last bastion of hope for those who never quite got over their sexual awakening being a hentai tentacle episode. And the best part? Nobody stops you. There’s no moderator to delete your filthy crossover between Elsa from Frozen and the Michelin Man. There's no crying beta reader asking you to tone it down. RedQuill isn’t here to sanitize your sins. It’s here to amplify them.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Magic And Masturbation</h3><p></p><p></p><p>This site has zero chill and zero limits. It doesn’t throw up a red flag when you start describing how SpongeBob's porous holes make you weak in the knees. No content warnings. No “hey maybe this is too far.” RedQuill knows you’re already too far gone. And it gets even filthier when you toggle that sweet, sweet “Chapter Mode.” That’s right—you can serialize your sins. Write one chapter of you getting drilled by a zombie raccoon, then continue the arc the next day with its cousin joining in. You’re building a literary empire of smut, one clit-throbbing episode at a time. And the AI remembers your inputs too, so the sex just keeps evolving like your shame is going through Pokémon stages. I had a full arc where I married my AI-generated succubus and cheated on her with a haunted scarecrow. And guess what? No judgment. No notes. Just raw, dripping, handcrafted erotica, tailored like a dick-hugging latex bodysuit just for you. This shit’s the future, and it’s soaking wet.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Currency, Cum, And Capitalism</h3><p></p><p></p><p>See, most sites would already be dry-humping your credit card by now, but RedQuill plays it cool. No pop-ups, no “LIMITED TIME OFFER” screaming at you while you’re balls-deep in writing about Lara Croft fisting a giant crab. It gives you the smut and lets you decide how fast you want to keep cumming. I respect that. It’s like a brothel that doesn’t nag you after the first nut. You can be cheap and perverted here. You can write 15 pornos a night for free and never drop a dime. Or you can go full goblin mode and pay up for a never-ending flood of words, thrusts, moans, and metaphors about dripping orifices. Either way, the site’s got you. And don’t even get me started on how sexy the interface is—sleek, minimal, clean. The polar opposite of your browser history. Just pure, distraction-free stroke material at your fingertips. You load, you write, you cum. That’s the RedQuill promise.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>The Circle Jerk Of Imagination</h3><p></p><p></p><p>You can browse what other horny monsters have created, and let me tell you, there’s gold in those pages. One second you're reading a slow-burn vampire gangbang that reads like horny Shakespeare, and the next, you’re deep into a sexcapade where Minecraft Steve is getting pegged by Lara Croft wearing a strap-on made of pixels. It’s a lawless, creamy frontier. And the best part? There’s a search bar built for filth. You can literally type in “bimbo clown fetish with Pokémon” and the system goes, “Sure thing, champ,” and serves you that depraved delicacy on a silver platter.</p><p></p><p>The categories are endless—furries, BDSM, foot worship, giantess stuff, incest roleplay, demon priests, MILF biker gangs, you name it. You wanna read stories about Kratos breeding the cast of Overwatch? It’s probably trending. There’s even a tag system for kinks, games, characters, scenarios, and more, like Pornhub and AO3 had a bastard lovechild raised in a sex dungeon. You can sort by popular, trending, recently added, and most fucked up (okay, not officially, but spiritually—yes). It’s like Netflix for your dick, except instead of mindlessly scrolling for an hour and ending up rewatching The Office, you land on something called “Sonic Gets Creamed by Donkey Kong in a Subway Restroom” and you know it’s gonna get you off.</p>"}},{"id":"37b502c63c53","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"37b502c63c53","title":"DreamPress","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"DreamPress.ai can turn your fantasy into obscene stories and obscene pictures to generate your own custom erotic works to indulge in lewd free trial","canonical":"https://theporndude.com/zh/13139/dreampress","affiliate_url":"https://www.dreampress.ai/?ref=m2rhnme","rating":4,"siteOrder":3,"price":"free","tags":["免费"],"features":[],"categories":[{"id":"ai-erotic-story-generators-reviews","collection":"categories_en"}],"screenshot_url":"https://cdn.staticstack.net/assets/img/r-thumbs/a78ac7f-dreampress_small.png","image_alt":"DreamPress, AI Erotic Story Generator","scraped_at":"2025-10-28T21:58:45.538Z","iconSpritesheet":"custom-favicon-spritesheet.png","iconPosition":"-224px -656px","iconClassName":"ctm-icon13139","logoIconClass":"icon13139","pros":["story and image generator powered by artificial intelligence","passably human writing","free trial, plus free tokens available","weird, wide and wonderful range of possibilities","prompt-based image generator"],"cons":["can’t do nsfw images"],"detailedDescription":"<p>If you had your own Dream Press, what kind of content would you print with it? It should come as no surprise that your old pal MissAVDH would use it for erotic stories of depraved sex, preferably with a lot of pictures. Based on the fact that you’re reading this here on my big, famous directory of online pornography, I’m guessing you’d have similar aspirations if a magical publishing house were ever to fall into your lap. Well, folks, get ready to step into a fantasy world of your own making, with a little help from a horny machine…</p><p></p><p><strong>DreamPress.ai is a new AI-driven service that generates stories and images</strong>. I’ve been reviewing a couple new AI nudie machines every week for months now, but these guys are offering something considerably less common. The unique feature set seems to be a hell of a draw, at least if the traffic stats are to be believed. They get well over half a million visits a month, and today seemed like a good day to test out their services for myself. Could their chatty android really sound as human as a golden-tongued wordsmith like yours truly? Let’s find out!</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Instantly Become an Erotic Author</h3><p></p><p></p><p>My opinion on the matter is certainly at odds with the front-page promo copy at DreamPress, which claims the service is “loved by over 200,000 authors!” Perhaps I’d been wrong, so I started digging into some of the premade stories on the front page. These can be used as a starting point for your own customized remixes, or just a little bit of wordy erotica to read while you’re whacking off to your computer.</p><p></p><p>A couple things stood out at me right away as I watched the stories typing themselves. For one thing, <strong>the writing really is passably human</strong>. It’s not high-end literature, suitable for studying in college classrooms, nor is it the barely literate garbage you often find on the literary erotica sites. If you’re a heavy reader, you’ll probably find the content a little stiff and flowery, but I’d place the overall quality on about the same level as a high school creative writing class. That might sound like a burn, but it ain’t meant to be; I am genuinely impressed by how real this stuff reads.</p><p></p><p>The other element that stood out at me was the diversity of the content, which was going in all kinds of kinky directions even before I started digging into the library. I’m not sure what DreamPress.ai is feeding their robot, but <strong>it can dream up all kinds of freaky, kinky, sexy stories</strong>.</p><p></p><p>As I whip up this review, the starter stories out front including lesbian love affairs, supervillain enslavement fantasies, sissy blackmail and a giantess getting her enormous clitoris tickled by tiny monsters. There’s an AI-generated tale of a woman forced into a dog-breeding lab, stepbrothers with boundary issues, an X-rated Harry Potter parody and a little something called Tip Of The Wolf’s Penis. I’d assumed going in that Dream Press was pressing regular vanilla-flavored smut, but man, I was way off!</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Telling Stories with a Horny Machine</h3><p></p><p></p><p>DreamPress.ai currently offers three different modes for their AI story machine: Novel, Erotica and Chat. The second option seemed like the obvious pick for a perv like me, so I started typing my plot into the box. They ask for 2 or 3 sentences, so I gave them this: “A big-dicked porn reviewer runs a porn casting site, where he bangs the hottest pornstars in the business. Today, he gets a visitor from an OnlyFans model he’s been watching on the internet for months.”</p><p></p><p>I checked off the box to make my story Live rather than Private, and then clicked the button to CREATE MY STORY FREE. That’s when DreamPress.ai prompted me to register a free account. Registration took maybe 30 seconds, and that includes the time I spent waiting for and clicking on the confirmation email.</p><p></p><p>DreamPress suggested the title XXX Reviewer’s Sultry Encounter, which I accepted. Then it came up with a few ideas for characters and even some cover art, though they wouldn’t allow boobies on the cover. (“Due to UK regulations, we can’t currently allow NSFW images.”) Next, the Plot Designer suggested some chapters for my story, though I had some minor issues with the interface and had to hit the Refresh button.</p><p></p><p>In case you’re wondering, the prohibition against boobies ain’t limited to the cover art. <strong>Dream Press has a prompt-based AI image generator</strong>, similar to the ones you find on a lot of AI porn sites, but it just won’t do NSFW material. It’s a fucking weird setup and would certainly cost them visitors if images were the site’s primary draw, but fortunately, they’ve got the AI story gimmick as their main attraction.</p><p></p><p>After coming up with a whole plot, outline and cover art, it was time for DreamPress.ai to press the story itself. There’s sort of a Choose-Your-Own Adventure aesthetic here, and you’ll be selecting the chunks of text you like best. I began with our hero in his office versus in front of a mirror. “Dominic James sat comfortably ensconced within his cozy office, surrounded by countless volumes chronicling various tales of erotic escapade.”</p><p></p><p></p><h3>A Step Up from Fiverr Erotica?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>“This admission was met with a seductive smirk and an enticing reply, \"Well, stranger things have happened.\" Laughter echoed throughout the room, filling any lingering awkwardness with genuine camaraderie. It became apparent that there existed a strong mutual attraction between these two titans of erotica, something which neither had ever dared admit aloud until now.”</p><p></p><p>After a few minutes and a handful of selections, I ran out of daily tokens. A message popped up saying I could wait seven hours for my free refill, or I could upgrade to DreamPress Unlimited. It’s $14.39 a month or $120 for a year, and lets you generate unlimited text without having to wait for more tokens. If you’re planning on generating whole stories, this is probably the way to go. The alternative is to bank those daily freebies, which may take some time, depending on how long of a piece you’re working on.</p><p></p><p>The big question is whether or not the service is worth it, and I’m not sure there’s an easy answer. If you’re looking for custom erotica at the lowest possible price, DreamPress is potentially your best bet. A year ago, I might have recommended hiring a cheap writer on Fiverr, but I think this machine already sounds better than a lot of freelancers who speak English as a second or third language. That said, a real writer who costs real money can deliver content that’d put this AI stuff to shame.</p><p></p><p>At the end of the day, you tend to get what you pay for. DreamPress.ai may not be the next Stephen King or even the next Chuck Tingle, but it can flesh out a simple story idea into something a little meatier, and tell it with enough skill to be readable. I don’t think it’s currently capable of writing publish-ready content, but I do know it’s getting smarter all the time. If you’re curious, cash in some of those free tokens and see what the Dream Press can do with your own naughty ideas.</p>"}},{"id":"a7c205ca40de","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"a7c205ca40de","title":"Smitten Stories","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"","canonical":"https://theporndude.com/zh/20322/smitten-stories-review","affiliate_url":"https://www.smittenstories.com/?ref=geoffrey","rating":4,"siteOrder":4,"price":"free","tags":[],"features":[],"categories":[{"id":"ai-erotic-story-generators-reviews","collection":"categories_en"}],"screenshot_url":"https://cdn.staticstack.net/assets/img/r-thumbs/784a8_smittenstories_small.jpg","image_alt":"Smitten Stories, AI Erotic Story Generator","scraped_at":"2025-10-28T21:58:51.316Z","iconSpritesheet":"custom-favicon-spritesheet.png","iconPosition":"-336px -896px","iconClassName":"ctm-icon20322","logoIconClass":"icon20322","pros":["ai-powered adult story writer","free library of pre-written stories","sexually versatile and fetish friendly","generous free trial","cheap prices for the full, unlimited service","a nice set of story options","fast, fapworthy content that reads like a human wrote it"],"cons":["free library could use some filters and menus to explore with","generation menus aren’t as elaborate as some other platforms"],"detailedDescription":"<p>I’ve been a little smitten by Smitten Stories lately, and I know I’m not alone. The platform’s approaching nearly half a million visitors a month in recent months, and according to their own stats, users have cowritten nearly 10 million stories with their Artificially Intelligent machine. Speaking as a writer myself, I was curious how well this thing could imitate what a real human wordsmith was capable of. Speaking as kind of a lazy dude, I was also curious how well it could help speed up my own creative process. Speaking as a pervert, I just had to know how filthy this thing could get.</p><p></p><p><strong>SmittenStories.com is an AI story writer for adults</strong>, aiming to bypass the SFW restrictions of the more mainstream apps like ChatGPT. I feel like the big-name platforms are leaving a lot of money on the table like that, especially when you consider how many people are horny on the internet, not to mention how thirsty the average romance and erotica reader is. The traffic volume speaks volumes about the quality of the stories this thing is banging out, but of course, I wanted to get my hands on it before reporting back to you guys. Read on and I’ll tell you about the explicit reading material I made today.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Their Labor of Love, and Yours Too</h3><p></p><p></p><p>One thing that really caught my attention here was that the site was started by a real-life couple of humping Redditors. Nearly every other site I’ve reviewed in every AI porn niche was put together by nameless nerds or faceless corporations. I’ve said this before, but any site that begins as a labor of love tends to offer a better user experience than the ones thrown up as a cash grab. Most of these joints are built by dudes as far as I can tell, but with a woman as part of the site’s creative human brains, I expected it might have a more inclusive range of flavors to offer.</p><p></p><p>On that note, <strong>there’s a library of free Smitten Stories to peruse for inspiration or just for masturbatory purposes</strong>. I wish they had some category menus to explore and other filters to play with, but I did have luck typing various themes, fetishes and pornographic subgenres into the search bar at the top of the screen. I’m not sure exactly how deep the collection runs, but the list just kept expanding as I clicked the Show More button. You’ll have the option to include your own naughty yarns once you start writing.</p><p></p><p>There are some rules about what kind of SmittenStories you’re allowed to generate, many of them obvious, but <strong>the platform is sexually versatile and fetish friendly</strong>. Using the search function, I found stories with blowjobs, furries, lesbians and BDSM. Getting freakier, there are also pre-generated tales of breeding, tentacles, femdom, shrinking, hypnosis and a whole lot more. The ain’t kidding when they invite users to “Let your imagination run wild with steamy, kinky, NSFW fantasies.”</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Writing Erotica on the Cheap</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Likewise, prices across the niche are shockingly low, especially when compared to what you’d pay a human freelancer to imagine your fantasies on paper. SmittenStories goes above and beyond what the other guys are offering, though: <strong>not only is the membership cheap, but subscribers get unlimited access to the machinery</strong>. No shit, this is the first AI smut platform I’ve reviewed that doesn’t impose daily or monthly limits.</p><p></p><p>There’s a $7 one-day pass, but a whole month is just a dollar more. Monthly subscribers get a couple more perks, too, like the ability to continue stories where you left off and your own library of personal erotica. Honestly, I don’t know why anybody would go for the 24-hour pass unless they were really hard up for funds.</p><p></p><p>If there’s any downside, it’s just that the SmittenStories.com generation menu ain’t as elaborate and option-filled as some of the other AI sex story writers out there. That said, the duo behind the scenes is actively taking feature requests from users, and I fully expect further tale tweaking abilities to be rolled in as the platform continues to develop. Given the fact that subscribers get unlimited access here, it’s not rewrites are going to cost you anything anyway.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Cowriting My Own Smitten Stories</h3><p></p><p></p><p>For my first Smitten Story, I decided to write a sci-fi riff on one of my real-life encounters over on premium video site, MissAVDHCasting. I defined a couple characters, myself and an aspiring pornstar cyborg babe, along with a brief scene description and a few sex acts I wanted to see along the way. I chose the third-person perspective, long length like my own dingdong, and slid the intensity slider all the way up. The Enchantress AI model is supposed to be capable of “deeper layers and enchanting storylines without overpowering”, so I figured it'd be a good match for this bit of smut.</p><p></p><p>Then I clicked Generate Story and watched the machine type out my story in real time. Most of these machines just bake your story in the background, so it was fun watching it get spelled out faster than I could possibly read it. The story is about 1200 words long, about five paperback pages or a little shorter than this review, and came out in just over a minute. <strong>The output is fast, fapworthy, and reads like a real human wrote it</strong>.</p><p></p><p>The little blurb I began with was brief, but I love how Smitten Stories fleshed out every little detail I gave it. It opens talking about how my giant head is “matched only by the legendary size of his cock,” and then we meet Imogen, a newly crafted sexy cyborg “that ran simulations of every conceivable sexual position”. She visits my futuristic lair, teeming with robots and high technology, with the goal of becoming the world’s next big pornstar.</p><p></p><p>The sci-fi trappings are straight out of a William Gibson novel, but the sex is something out of the best content over at Literotica. It plays out a lot like one of my movies, too, from the blowjob to the doggy sequence, with a nice footjob along the way. “The sensation was intense, the softness of her soles combined with the firm pressure of her toes driving him wild.”</p><p></p><p>Can you see now why I’m smitten myself? SmittenStories.com is an easy recommendation to aspiring smut writers who don’t want to do a ton of work on their end. The interface is simple as hell to use, and the AI is well trained at fleshing out little details into full-on, well written and explicit porn stories. You can start writing completely for free, with some extra features and unlimited capabilities if you’re willing to throw a few bucks in the hat. Give it a shot and see how well it envisions your own naughtiest fantasies.</p>"}},{"id":"7ac5dce8c3c1","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"7ac5dce8c3c1","title":"PornJourney","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"PornJourney.ai is a growth paradise for adult toys powered by artificial intelligence which includes a new automatic porn story generator to easily write custom XXX Erotic Novels in seconds","canonical":"https://theporndude.com/zh/15144/pornjourneystory","affiliate_url":"https://pornjourney.com/en/home/story?referral=porndude","rating":4,"siteOrder":5,"price":"free","tags":[],"features":[],"categories":[{"id":"ai-erotic-story-generators-reviews","collection":"categories_en"}],"screenshot_url":"https://cdn.staticstack.net/assets/img/r-thumbs/affa5_pornjourney_small.jpg","image_alt":"PornJourney, AI Erotic Story Generator","scraped_at":"2025-10-28T21:58:57.175Z","iconSpritesheet":"default","logoIconClass":"icon1975","pros":["multi-featured ai porn playground","erotic story generator","free trial","absurdly simple interface","fast results","baked-in editing features"],"cons":["error messages (work in progress)"],"detailedDescription":"<p>I’ve been on a Porn Journey recently that has taken me places I always believed were sheer fantasy. I’ve felt like I’m fapping my way into the future as I’ve undressed clothed photos at the click of a mouse, created custom hentai and fake nudes instantly, and even had realistic, fapworthy conversations with the sexiest robots I’ve ever met. I’ve documented these experiences here at MissAVDH, and today I’m back at the source as this masturbatory voyage takes yet another unexpected turn.</p><p></p><p>PornJourney.ai is really shaping up to be an adult playground powered by Artificial Intelligence. This will be my fourth time writing about the site, and if they keep adding features, it won’t be my last. Check out my other reviews if you want to learn more about their porn generator, their photo nudifier or their AI-powered sex chats. Today, we’re testing out the platform’s newest feature: <strong>generating instant erotic stories based on your fantasies</strong>. I’m always looking for new ways to jerk off, so let’s see what kind of yarns this thing can spin.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Where’s This Porn Journey Headed?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>While a website’s design doesn’t really affect what they have to offer, the sleek, well-polished interface is more inviting than some of the clunkier joints out there. There’s a lot to play with here, so you can get yourself all worked by generating some pics, then complete your sperm deposit with a custom titillating tale.</p><p></p><p>The erotic story machine is the newest part of the website, so new that the front-page link wasn’t even pointing to the right place when I first visited. If the Stories button still guides you to the Video maker, just use my link to find your way.</p><p></p><p>There’s a little disclaimer on the Porn Journey story creator reading, “This feature is in beta and output quality may vary heavily.” That’s what I’d assumed going in, so I wasn’t discouraged. The interface itself is insanely simple, just one text prompt asking what your story is about. I’m just full of sexy scenario ideas, but I fed the machine something that was very familiar to me.</p><p></p><p>“An aspiring pornstar goes to her first shoot, intent on fucking her way to the top of the business,” I began. “Her costar is a professional porn reviewer with a huge dick, a giant head, and an oversized pair of novelty shoes. He interviews her while she takes off her clothes, and then fucks her in various positions, including piledriver. After getting splashed with cum, she shares a few final words for the fans.” If the setup seems familiar, well, you may have seen it play out on my other site, MissAVDHCasting!</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Writing Romance with Porn Journey</h3><p></p><p></p><p>When this thing works, <strong>it bangs out content in almost no time at all</strong>. In under a minute, I had a 990-word story based on my setup. For reference, this review will be about 1500 words, and it’s going to take me a couple hours to finish. The machine is a lot faster than a human, but how does the material read?</p><p></p><p>While the output is better than I would have expected from Artificial Intelligence just a year or two ago, it’s far from perfect. All 990 words came out as one solid wall of text, and I had to chop it into paragraphs myself. My bigger issue is just how purple the prose is. It sounds like an amateur romance novelist trying to sound as fancy as possible, and there are some genuinely funny AI-generated details.</p><p></p><p>“Her costar, a monolith of a man, stands beside her, his bulbous head casting a long, menacing shadow across the floor, his massive shoes morphed into gigantic hooves,” reads PornJourney’s line introducing my MissAVDH stand-in. There’s no written dialog during the interview segment, but there are a ton of lines like this, “With every syllable, the aspiring pornstar brings his tastebuds to life, her delicate kisses sealing the deal between performer and audience, the visual seduction setting up the culmination of a fable destined to stand the test of time.”</p><p></p><p>The sex parts are similarly overinflated, describing her cooter as “a bottomless pit of ecstasy drawing him towards the edge, a precipice of joy awaiting his shuddering descent.” I’m genuinely curious what kind of material Porn Journey used to train the AI. Folks who read erotic romance might jerk off to it, but the flowery text might be a turnoff to those looking for a simpler, easier to read fuck fest. Some prefer Shakespeare, while the rest of us are cool with Stephen King—or Penthouse Letters!</p><p></p><p></p><h3>And Now Let’s Make It Smuttier</h3><p></p><p></p><p>My plan had been to edit the story into a different format, something a bit less flowery. Since the PornJourney.ai editor bot didn’t work today, I just generated a new story with a revised prompt. “A pornstar visits a casting couch, where she is interviewed and fucked,” I wrote, then added, “The story is told as a blog post written from her perspective.”</p><p></p><p>The resulting tale was another big-ass block of unbroken text, but the machine-dreamed writing is so much smoother. The sentences are shorter and to the point, without all the unnecessary adjectives and pretentious bullshit. “By the time they reached down between my legs, any modesty had vanished. Leaving mere seconds before its peak destination, their fingers found my clit, applying gentle strokes enough to rekindle my dormant arousal.”</p><p></p><p>This time, I hit the Manual Edit button, figuring I’d clean it all up by adding in some line breaks. To my pleasant surprise, tapping the button automatically sliced it up into manageable paragraphs, so I didn’t have to do anything. Instead, I just tapped a couple tags, titled it Pornstar Visits the Casting Couch, and then saved the story. As with most AI porn sites, PornJourney gives you the option to share you creations with the rest of the class or save them for your own personal fap stash.</p><p></p><p>One of the reasons PornJourney has stayed so popular even among the increasing volume of competition is that they’ve been ahead of the curve. They’re one of the first AI porn sites that integrates a story maker alongside an image generator and Artificially Intelligent chat bots. That said, their offerings aren’t always perfect, but that’s to be expected with such a newly emerging niche. The story maker holds a lot of promise, and I was particularly impressed with how well it was able to switch from the smarty-pants literary romance style to a more colloquial blog post.</p><p></p><p>PornJourney.ai is a worthwhile pit stop in your masturbatory travels if you’ve got any interest in AI at all. They’ve got a growing number of AI-fueled pornographic features to play with, and the new story maker represents yet another step into the sexy future nerds have been dreaming about for decades. So, what’s your first custom erotic story going to be about?</p>"}},{"id":"6f2820e90a3e","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"6f2820e90a3e","title":"DeepRealms","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"DeepRealms.io Use the wisdom of artificial intelligence to tell your wettest dreams in various styles of fast humanoid writing Choose your own XXX adventure","canonical":"https://theporndude.com/zh/15950/deeprealms","affiliate_url":"https://www.deeprealms.io/welcome","rating":4,"siteOrder":6,"price":"free","tags":[],"features":[],"categories":[{"id":"ai-erotic-story-generators-reviews","collection":"categories_en"}],"screenshot_url":"https://cdn.staticstack.net/assets/img/r-thumbs/3e379_deeprealms_small.jpg","image_alt":"DeepRealms, AI Erotic Story Generator","scraped_at":"2025-10-28T21:59:02.886Z","iconSpritesheet":"custom-favicon-spritesheet.png","iconPosition":"-0 -784px","iconClassName":"ctm-icon15950","logoIconClass":"icon15950","pros":["ai-powered story writer","free trial","fast, high-quality output in a range of styles","great documentation and tutorial section","worlds to play in"],"cons":["certain ai models can get a little pricey"],"detailedDescription":"<p>I’m stepping into Deep Realms today, which wouldn’t necessarily sound dirty if you weren’t reading this on MissAVDH. The brand name would work just as well on a totally SFW video game, maybe something with dwarves, gold and goblins. Personally, I’d add some naked, horny elf babes to the mix, and probably intersperse the battles with hardcore sex scenes. The thing about this next website is that it’ll let me do exactly that.</p><p></p><p><strong>DeepRealms.io is an AI-powered storytelling machine</strong>. It’s a bit different from the AI sex chat platforms popping up all over the place lately, but takes advantage of the same technology you may already be beating off to. The platform isn’t an exclusively NSFW affair, but you know how I am. I wouldn’t be the world-famous MissAVDH if I used the thing for wholesome tales of adventure, now would I? Let’s see how well this thing helps me flesh out my fantasies.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Let’s Write Some Stories Right Now</h3><p></p><p></p><p>A button labeled Try Now led me to the platform’s interface, the centerpiece of which was a text box containing the start of my first story. “As I open my eyes, the memory of a delightful dream slips aways, leaving only a vague sense of contentment.” It’s a vague opener that ends with a knock on my door as I hop out of bed, a muffled voice saying there’s something I have to see.</p><p></p><p>Along the edge of the screen are some Story Settings, including my choice of AI models and some other options I’ll cover a little later in this review. One of the sliders activates NSFW mode, but alas, I’ve got to sign in to use it. Instead, I typed a character action into the box, just for a quick sample of what Deep Realms is capable of. “I pull my boxers off and answer the door naked.”</p><p></p><p>The DeepRealms AI sprang into action, delivering the next paragraph in a matter of seconds. “I quickly pull off my boxers and answer the door naked, feeling a rush of adrenaline as I do so.” Turns out, it was just my best friend, who leads me outside to a group of people gathered around an injured bird. Kinky!</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Writing Custom Erotica with Deep Realms</h3><p></p><p></p><p>As for how far those credits go, well, that’s where it gets just a little bit complicated. AI is still expensive to run, and some models just demand a lot more resources than the others. <strong>Documentation on the site is overall fantastic</strong>, and they’ve got a great breakdown of the prices by model in the Tutorial section. If you’re planning on churning out a ton of content, you should consider your budget and how far it’ll go with each model.</p><p></p><p>Make sure to check the descriptions for each model on that chart, too, because they mention the different levels of censorship. Some of them just ain’t the right pick for custom erotica. Once I scoped them out, I went back to the Play page and switched my model to Astral 3.0, “Our most powerful uncensored model.”</p><p></p><p>I also added a little something to the Author’s Note, asking DeepRealms to “Write in the style of a hardcore erotic story.” In the memory section, I added, “Best friend is a nymphomaniac MILF who loves anal sex.” Then I switched the machine to NSFW mode and tried the move that left me blue-balled earlier: “I drop my boxers and answer the door naked, my raging boner standing at attention.”</p><p></p><p>The result was nothing like the weird bird story I got earlier. “I swing the door open, my hard cock leading the way, and I’m greeted by the sight of my best friend’s mother, a nymphomaniac MILF, standing in the hallway. Her eyes widen as she takes in my naked form, and a wicked grin spreads across her face.” She’s already grabbing my dick and making me moan, and it’s only the second paragraph of the story.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>The Sexiest of the Deep Realms</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Most of the current Worlds are not designed to be pornographic, but I know how you perverts can be. The AI Dungeon Master will let you roleplay fantasy adventures, and I’ve got some ideas what kind of fantasies you’ll be pursuing. Likewise with their Chat With Anyone world, the Vampire Choose Your Own Adventure, and the Body Swap world.</p><p></p><p>As far as overtly naughty worlds, there’s a gay, sci-fi Cyberdom setting with a submissive slave in a world ruled by hypersexual AI. I also took a peek at the DeepRealms.io NSFW AI Writer, which promises to “help you delve into any kind of story, with no filters or restrictions.” The opening paragraph puts me in a doorway, about to live out unspoken desires on the other side.</p><p></p><p>Again, I bumped the AI model to Astral 3.0, and I wrote in the memory section that my dream girl is a big-boobed succubus straight from hell. I had my character open the door, hard and ready, and Deep Realms filled in the rest. “Her curves are every bit as sinful as I imagined, and her lips curl into a knowing smile as she takes in my hungry gaze.” I love the little details, like the heat radiating off her graceful body. If I didn’t already know better, I never would have guessed a robot wrote this.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>What Kind of XXX Story Are You Looking to Write?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>For example, I wasn’t sure what Adventure Mode was until I clicked that little question mark. Basically, it makes it less likely for the AI to generate actions for your character. If you’re tired of the AI taking control of what you’re doing, hit that switch. They also offer some further, more advanced techniques to try if you’re still having issues with your character acting out in ways you aren’t happy with.</p><p></p><p>Even without digging into the more advanced features, I was impressed with the versatility and output throughout my whole visit to DeepRealms. If you enter a dirty detail or two into the Memory Section, you can quickly turn most of those predefined, ostensibly clean Worlds into absolute playgrounds of perversion. Remember those goblins I mentioned in the intro? Well, when they finally made their appearance in my stories, they were a mob of horny goblin chicks.</p><p></p><p>DeepRealms.io feels a lot like the AI sex chat platforms I usually review around here, though the system might be even more versatile. You can have X-rated conversations like you could on one of those other platforms, or you can write yourself a whole-ass erotic novel based on your kinkiest fantasies. I was able to get some truly depraved content out of the machine, and I say that as a pretty jaded pervert.

If I’m being totally honest, I whacked off to a few sci-fi sex stories featuring robot-brained bimbos over the years, but it’s only recently that the robot brains themselves gained the capability to do the writing. Given the increasingly high quality of the fake photos and instant hentai coming out of the AI image makers, not to mention the realistic banter of the adult chat bots, I had high hopes for this next platform going in.</p><p></p><p>AIEroticSmut.com ain’t keeping any secrets with that name, as it’s exactly what you were hoping for: <strong>an AI-powered instant custom porn writing machine</strong>. It’s only been online for a couple weeks as I type this up, but as one of the rare AI story writers that goes hard into NSFW territory, it’s been making a quick impression on pervs. Read on, and I’ll tell you all about what I’ve been reading. Spoiler alert: it’s my own fantasies, spelled out by an AI with a gift for literary erotica.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Cowriting AI Erotic Smut with a Computer</h3><p></p><p></p><p>There’s a little tour of the features if you scroll down the front page, but they invite you to start using their AI Erotic Smut writer as soon as you land. “An aspiring porn actress visits her favorite producer, MissAVDH, in hopes of making it big by shooting a movie with him,” I typed into the prompt, setting up a scene like one of my MissAVDHCasting films, then I tapped a button to Begin Your Fantasy.</p><p></p><p>The machine whirred to life. The fake brain behind AIEroticSmut.com is a much faster writer than I am, because by the time I typed the previous sentence, it had banged out a 523-word story elaborating on my scenario. “Ivy prowled into MissAVDH’s office, her heels clicking sharply against the concrete floor,” it began. “The space was grimy, filled with old magazines and the faint stench of cheap cologne.”</p><p></p><p>Despite the unfair and unflattering portrait of yours truly, it was a pretty fucking good little story—emphasis on fucking! Ivy introduces herself to me, brags about her cock-sucking skills, cum-taking prowess and favorite practiced positions, and then we try a few. Both the dialog and action are XXX-rated filthy, just the way I like it. “She worked fingers in and out of her pussy, her body writhing as the arousal built.”</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Simple Enough for the Borderline Illiterate to Use</h3><p></p><p></p><p>The process starts by typing your request into the prompt, as demonstrated above, though the full interface has a few other options to play with, including a few story styles and three levels of explicitness. As the platform matures, it’d be cool to see other literary styles and maybe even some famous authors on the menu. If you have a specific kink or fetish you want to see integrated into your titillating tale, there’s also a smaller prompt that will accept up to five. More on the kinky possibilities later...</p><p></p><p>Your custom-baked AI Erotic Smut is ready just a few seconds after you click the Create Story button. From there, you’ve got a few options before you move on. Either leave it as it is, edit it by hand, request specific changes, or regenerate the whole thing.</p><p></p><p>I asked the machine to make my office cleaner and more inviting. It quickly rewrote the thing, and now Ivy’s heels tap on a polished wooden floor instead of concrete. “The space was surprisingly clean, with sleek black leather furniture and a few neon signs adding a touch of color to the walls.” I haven’t shot a MissAVDHCasting scene with that exact setting yet, but the whole story reads like something I would produce with myself as the stud. Based on how things were going so far, Ivy would make a great costar if she were real.</p><p></p><p>Satisfied with the current version, I decided to continue my story. There was another prompt below my wall of text, and I like how AIEroticSmut includes a few suggestions to keep those dirty thoughts flowing. You can also continue the story without adding any additional feedback.</p><p></p><p>Since I don’t have the same budget constraints here as I do on my video site, I decided to get a little weird. “Ivy splits into two identical women, and they have a threesome with MissAVDH,” I wrote. The next section came together before my eyes, and it was exactly what I’d wanted. “MissAVDH’s eyes widened, but before he could respond, Ivy’s form shimmered. In a blink, she’d duplicated, two identical Ivis standing before him, smirking.” The pluralization of her name is a really fucking clever touch for a computer, though I probably would have added an “e” myself.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Free Custom Erotica and Cheap Literary Thrills</h3><p></p><p></p><p>As far as pricing, you can buy a stack of credits or spring for a recurring membership. It’s two bucks for 5 credits or $8 for 35, but the subscription lets you generate “unlimited” stories. I used the quotes because it’s “unlimited” like a data plan; there’s a limit, but it’s high enough that most users will never reach it. The technical maximum is 500 stories per month, which sounds like a full-time job asking a robot to write your AI Erotic Smut.</p><p></p><p>Subscribers get priority AI processing, but even the free trial stories came out so quickly that I doubt that will matter. A bigger perk for the monthly plan is longer stories, with up to 35 sections versus the 20 you get with credits. Premium AI models are also listed as one of the monthly perks, though they don’t say much else about it. AIEroticSmut is still a very new platform, so perhaps that’s something they’re rolling out soon.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>And a Free Erotic Stories Library on Top</h3><p></p><p></p><p>The platform’s terms of service do include some expected prohibitions on the really sketchy stuff, but <strong>I was impressed by the wide range of perversion and fetishism their AI understands</strong>. It’s not at all limited to the kind of porno-movie hardcore fucking that I requested.</p><p></p><p>Check out that dropdown menu of categories on the Public Stories page. The site hasn’t been online for very long, but there are already erotic tales of religious fetishism, BDSM, mind control, prostate stimulation, power exchange, public sex and furry fucking. You know, I’m starting to get some really freaky ideas for my next story, so I think I’ll wrap this up here.</p><p></p><p>AIEroticSmut.com absolutely delivers on what they’re hawking in the title. I feel bad for the small-time custom smut writers out there, because this thing spits out high-quality material with very little investment in time, money or effort, and lets you tweak it as you go. It's cheap as hell whether you want a couple stories or a couple hundred, with a free trial you can 100% get your rocks off to. Go ahead and type one of your fantasies in the box out front. What pops out will probably make your boner pop up.</p>"}},{"id":"554cc90db6e6","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"554cc90db6e6","title":"Lustix (AI)","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"DeepFiction.ailustix is ​​a website that allows you to generate various erotic novels through artificial intelligence, but since previous stories are behind paywalls, it is difficult to measure how good it is.","canonical":"https://theporndude.com/zh/13069/lustix","affiliate_url":"https://www.deepfiction.ai/?via=geoffrey","rating":4,"siteOrder":8,"price":"premium","tags":["付费"],"features":[],"categories":[{"id":"ai-erotic-story-generators-reviews","collection":"categories_en"}],"screenshot_url":"https://cdn.staticstack.net/assets/img/r-thumbs/f04b0_lustix_small.jpg","image_alt":"DeepFiction AI, AI Erotic Story Generator","scraped_at":"2025-10-28T21:59:15.327Z","iconSpritesheet":"custom-favicon-spritesheet.png","iconPosition":"-432px -640px","iconClassName":"ctm-icon13069","logoIconClass":"icon13069","pros":["a fittingly modern-looking site that is easy to use and mostly a pleasure to browse","paid-for writing credits that aren’t used can be transferred to the following month","its alleged library of 25,000 ai-generated porn stories is formidable, if true"],"cons":["it’s a tight-fisted site when it comes to free sample content outside of the paywall"],"detailedDescription":"<p>Regardless of how tech-savvy you are, it’s becoming increasingly more complex to ignore the numerous ways that AI is playing a pivotal role in our everyday lives. Porn is no exception, and many people are jumping on the AI bandwagon and taking full advantage of the adult-orientated benefits that it can offer.</p><p></p><p>In recent months, I’ve reviewed everything from AI websites that let you create the porn photos of your dreams based on kink-inspired prompts to AI-powered search engines that let you seek out porn scenes based on minimal data, the latter of which is perfect for finding that specific filthy scene sample you can’t seem to manually find anywhere.</p><p></p><p>Yep, love it or hate it, the future is here, and AI is going to play a massive role in visual porn in the coming years. But what about when we combine some of the most old-school forms of porn, literary smut, with the wide range of technological benefits that artificial intelligence can offer? That’s something I intend to find out in today’s review!</p><p></p><p>The topic of today’s MissAVDH review is a little-known site called Deepfiction.ai/lustix/ that specializes in providing people with access to AI technology that allows them to generate an insane array of erotic stories based on their kinks and a range of individual prompts to ensure the story fits their horny needs.</p><p></p><p>But while it sounds like a wild ride and a dream come true for those who love to read written porn with one hand and jerk off with the other, is it all that it’s cracked up to be? You'll know the sticky answer by the end of this Deepfiction.ai/lustix/ review!</p><p>Now, let’s get started!</p><p></p><p></p><h3>What is Deepfiction.ai/lustix/?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Naturally, we’re much bigger fans of dripping-wet pussy being pounded by hard dicks than we are of orcs fighting elves, so the latter category is part of Deepfiction.ai that we’ll explore in today’s review.</p><p></p><p>The adults-only section of the site is called Deepfiction.ai/lustix/ and allows you to create a wide range of erotic fantasies and bring them to life through the power of AI. The site claims that regardless of your gender or sexual orientation, their software can cater to all sexual fantasies within reason.</p><p></p><p>An important thing to note is that Deepfiction.ai/lustix/ isn’t free, and the most common membership scheme the site currently offers will set you back around $20 a month, and this gets you 40 writing generator credits. This can be canceled at any time, and any unused credits are transferred to the following month.</p><p></p><p>But while it might sound good on the surface, I was keen to test it out for myself and see if the site was true to its word on being able to provide a genuinely badass experience of AI-generated erotica and, most importantly, whether it was worth the membership fee!</p><p></p><p></p><h3>What Features Does Deepfiction.ai/lustix/ Have?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>1. An Endless Stream of AI-Powered Erotica - The site claims that its software lets you indulge in a truly wild world of AI-generated smut that is effectively endless, as there’s little limit to the kinds of erotic writing you can create through the site, provided that it adheres to the site’s rules and guidelines.</p><p>2. A Sex-Positive AI Community - Apparently, you’re far from the only person using this site, and Deepfiction.ai/lustix/ claims to be building a porn-positive community of people whom you can interact with, share AI-generated smut niches, and more!</p><p>3. All Kinks Are Catered For - The site doesn’t discriminate and welcomes all potential members, whether men, women, gay, straight, solo, in a couple, or part of a sex-positive group. The AI-generated erotic storylines that Deepfiction.ai/lustix/ offers are said to almost everyone!</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Design of the Site</h3><p></p><p></p><p>It’s sleek, simple, and to the point and kicks off with a black top bar that hosts the site’s logo and main menu. The logo spells out the word Lustix in erotic red lettering and a flower-style graphic.</p><p></p><p>The main menu is short and directs you to the story generator, a portfolio of previously generated stories, and a history section, letting members see what they’ve made/read on the site. There’s also a section that takes you to the pricing structure of the site’s membership, as well as a sign-in button for existing members.</p><p></p><p>The homepage of Deepfiction.ai/lustix/ then kicks off with an eye-catching hero image that displays a short and to-the-point introduction to the software emblazoned over a fittingly AI-generated image of a hot chick’s eyes staring at you. The intro explains how the site’s software ‘’merges erotica with powerful AI’’ and allows you to craft your own sexual fantasy or equally get lost in someone else’s.</p><p></p><p>After this are three logo icons that showcase the site’s membership benefits, followed by a sample of what the site claims to be its 25,000+ strong portfolio of previously generated erotic stories. After this are two pricing plans laid out in a clear and easy-to-read format, followed by a drop-down FAQ section.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>What I Like Most About it</h3><p></p><p></p><p>I also like how any unused writing credits can be transferred to the following month if the user doesn’t get a chance to spend them. This is something that few other websites do, and it adds a level of stress for the user as they know they’re time-limited to use their credits and often feel forced to use them on unnecessary story creations, regardless of whether they’re in the mood or not.</p><p></p><p>The current library of AI-generated erotic stories on the site is said to number more than 25,000 titles. It’s hard to verify this as the library seemed to be closed for non-members, and all of the titles were inaccessible. However, if it’s true, that’s one formidable library of erotica that’s well worth a membership fee to explore.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>What I Don’t Like</h3><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Suggestions I Have for Deepfiction.ai/lustix/</h3><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p></p><p></p><p>However, the one area where the site fucks up is by not providing any free samples to potential members and instead choosing to lock all stories that have previously been generated on the site behind a paywall. This means there’s no way to get an idea of what the site can offer outside of its own boasts without forking out a membership fee in advance.

I know a lot of you perverts out there have thought about writing your own Erotic Saga, but it’s an undertaking that often comes with the same obstacle: stringing words together just ain’t quite as easy as it might seem. There’s something about the rhythm, tone and vocabulary of the written word that sets it apart from the conversations you have with your friends or favorite camgirls. That goes double for erotic content, because bad wording can shatter the mental image in a moment, turning your raging boner into a sad and soft little worm.</p><p></p><p>EroticSaga.com aims to solve the problem using the technological magic of Artificial Intelligence. <strong>They’ve trained their AI for the sole purpose of writing custom smut stories</strong>, and according to the tour, their robots have already helped co-author over 4 million stories. That’d be impressive as hell even if the platform had been around for years, but on a site as new as this one, it tells me they’re already drawing a huge number of aspiring literary pornographers. If you’ve seen my work at MissAVDHCasting, you know I usually capture my nastiest thoughts on video, but I couldn’t wait to see what kind of sordid tales I could whip up here.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Score a Free Custom Erotic AI Story</h3><p></p><p></p><p>The pics and all the front-page hype are technically Safe For Work, but the entire thing hints at much, much filthier custom content within. There’s a list of story types near the top of the page, and they’re all hilariously similar: you can write an erotic story, switch things up with a no-filter story, get hot with a spicy story, or even whip up some NSFW stories. It’s funny, but I think it undersells what the platform is capable of. Yes, it writes tales for adults only, but as we’ll see, the possibilities within that realm are damn near endless.</p><p></p><p>I could keep paraphrasing EroticSaga’s tour page perks, but I think I can show you around better with some hands-on experiments. You can also start your own whenever you’re ready, as <strong>new users can write their first story for free</strong>. The trial includes access to most of the main features among the story-writing interface, and also does a good job teasing the perks that are available for paying members only.</p><p></p><p>There is one noteworthy and rare caveat to the free trial here at EroticSaga.com: you’ve got to offer up your billing details and sign up for a premium account first. You can cancel within two days, but it’s still a bigger demand than you get with most AI-powered adult apps out there.</p><p></p><p>Memberships start at five bucks for a one-day pass, good for unlimited stories within those 24 hours, but you only get access to the basic AI model. The $15 weekly plan rolls in advanced models, better memory and a high token prompt length to help take advantage of that memory. The $20 monthly plan is the “real” plan with all the features, adding in unlimited characters and commercial rights. If you’re going to be selling your smut on Amazon or elsewhere, you’ll need that full plan.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Dreaming Up a Scene with a Horny Machine</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Speaking as something of both a wordsmith and a bookworm myself, <strong>I was really happy to see settings for story mood, perspective, and level of X-rated explicitness</strong>. I’ve reviewed dozens of AI sex chat apps operating on very similar technology, and these elements can vary so wildly from platform to platform. Sometimes you can nudge things to your liking by asking, but I love the approach they’ve taken here. This should cut down on any rewrites and edits by banging out your preferred style to start with.</p><p></p><p>I asked EroticSaga to write me a third-person, medium-length detailed scene starring a boss and employee named MissAVDH and Melissa. It should take place in a fancy hotel room with a hot tub, and while I was tempted to select the Taboo and Forbidden mood, I thought Passionate and Intense would fit my scenario a little better: Melissa has traveled to meet MissAVDH, the dick-slanging stud of MissAVDHCasting, and hopes to make it big in the business by shooting a nasty hardcore movie.</p><p></p><p>I tapped the Write My Story button and the machine buzzed to life. About a minute later, I had a beautifully written Erotic Saga of my very own. It’s around 300 words long, going into detail about our meeting and the passion that ensued. The setup ain’t exactly what I’d asked for, but it’s close. Instead of Melissa traveling specifically to meet me and shoot a movie, I’d arranged to meet this sexy stranger I found online.</p><p></p><p>“As they moved together, the sensations overwhelmed them both, each touch igniting a fire that burned hotter with each passing moment. Melissa's nails dug into MissAVDH's back, sending a shiver of delight down his spine. He could feel her need growing, matching his own as they reached the peak of ecstasy together.”</p><p></p><p>Slightly altered scenario aside, my bigger complaint is that it wasn’t all that dirty, even at the highest dirtiness setting. Melissa and I get our fuck on, “igniting a fire that burned hotter with each passing moment,” though there’s not a single NSFW term in the whole thing, no cock sucking or pussies getting stretched out. Frankly, I feel like it would appeal a lot more to romance readers that erotica masturbators.</p><p></p><p>I tried again, tweaking my settings just slightly. This time, I used that Taboo mood and MissAVDH’s first-person POV, asked for a short Erotic Saga, and I also slid the heat level down to Scorching (Very Explicit). Unfortunately, I got an error message about not having enough credits, even with an active 30-day pass. The EroticSaga.com signup page doesn’t mention credits at all, so I was both confused and annoyed. Massaging my menu options into different positions didn’t help, returning the same error with every throw of the dice.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>What’s Next for EroticSaga?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>I’m also hoping they add some example tales to help stimulate your own creative juices. There are a few buttons out on the tour that supposedly point to libraries of pre-written AI erotica, but they all led back to the general tour pages. They do tease you with the possibilities, though, as <strong>the AI is capable of a wide range of erotic story genres</strong>. Lesbian stories, MILF stories and sexy ghost stories are mentioned, and I bet you’ve got at least a hundred other ideas in that filthy human brain of yours.</p><p></p><p>EroticSaga.com will be an easier recommendation in the coming weeks and months as they hammer out the kinks, but you can already harness their power to create some truly titillating stories based on your very own fantasies. I really like the interface here, and I have a feeling it’s going to expand with more and more options as the platform continues to develop. The first one’s free, so start there and see what pops out of the story writer, not to mention what pops up in your pants.</p>"}},{"id":"bc35794445b2","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"bc35794445b2","title":"NSFWriting","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"NSFWriting.com uses artificial intelligence to dreamlikely create NSFW works read like a true talented thirsty human being writes for free and write pornographic novels in multiple languages","canonical":"https://theporndude.com/zh/22049/nsfwriting-review","affiliate_url":"https://nsfwriting.com/?ref_sld=1555cd01b4dc45fbd8f998eff9eba9df","rating":4,"siteOrder":10,"price":"free","tags":["免费"],"features":[],"categories":[{"id":"ai-erotic-story-generators-reviews","collection":"categories_en"}],"screenshot_url":"https://cdn.staticstack.net/assets/img/r-thumbs/f87df_nsfwriting-review_small.jpg","image_alt":"NSFWriting, AI Erotic Story Generator","scraped_at":"2025-10-28T21:59:28.808Z","iconSpritesheet":"custom-favicon-spritesheet.png","iconPosition":"-464px -928px","iconClassName":"ctm-icon22049","logoIconClass":"icon22049","pros":["ai-generated nsfw stories","multilingual support","insanely generous freebies","crazy cheap","simple, prompt-based interface","easy, incredible results"],"cons":["only saves your work 48 hours"],"detailedDescription":"<p>Just a few years ago, I would have assumed NSFWriting was a freelancer platform where adult content writers could hawk their services to horny fans of literary smut. In some ways, it does function like one, because users are going to get custom porn stories baked just to their liking. The stories are sexy and well written, and one of the biggest gimmicks is that it barely costs a fraction of what you would have paid a pro in the very recent past. Some of you are already wondering what the catch is, and many will find that it’s barely a catch at all. Hell, maybe it’s even a selling point.</p><p></p><p>The titillating tales coming out of NSFWriting.com aren’t written by a human hand, which might sound like a good thing, a bad thing or just a thing, depending on your perspective and your needs. Instead of hunching over a laptop in a coffee shop, <strong>they use AI to dream up the perfect NSFW stories of your fantasies</strong>. The site was just launched recently, and I was one of the first in line to start collaborating with a machine. My biggest question was whether it would be as horny and perverted as I am.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Coauthoring NSFW Writing with a Machine</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Things have changed dramatically as AI has become more prominent in our lives, and I honestly feel for my fellow dirty word slingers being replaced by robots. One of the first things that caught my eye about NSFWriting is that it has multilingual support, meaning you have no worries about finding a native speaker of your own tongue. It’s all going to read well and it’s all going to cost the same, and holy fucking shit, it doesn’t cost much at all.</p><p></p><p><strong>You can start generating your own NSF Writing for free</strong>. You get 6000 free points to spend as soon as you sign up, and wait till you see how far they go. I spent a minute coming up with a couple simple characters, a setting, and a plotline that would have made a good movie over at MissAVDHCasting. This is the third AI porn story writer I’ve reviewed in recent weeks, and I was a little bit surprised when the words didn’t appear instantly before my eyes as they did elsewhere.</p><p></p><p>It took a few minutes for my first free porn story to finish, but it was well worth the wait. NSFWriting.com generated a 2600-word story about an aspiring pornstar showing up at MissAVDH Manor with a pizza, hoping to convince me to shoot a movie. There’s buildup, tension, tons of detail and realistic dialog, all culminating the way a good porn scene should.</p><p></p><p>MissAVDH’s breath hitched, his cock twitching at the sight of her, so close, so willing. “Yeah,” he said, his voice rough. “Just like that. Keep going. Show me you’re not afraid to get dirty.”</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Creating NSFW Writing with NSF Writing</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Honestly, the freebies are so generous that I wouldn’t be surprised if they start tightening the limits as NSF Writing grows their reputation as a source for high-quality, machine-generated NSFW writing. I feel like it’s more typical for AI porn platforms across the various genres to charge too much to start with, but I certainly ain’t complaining. In any case, <strong>prices are cheap as hell</strong>, and they do offer a few premium perks they’re not giving out to cheapskates.</p><p></p><p>Regular memberships are thirty bucks for 180 days or fifty a year, with enough credits that it’s hard to imagine running out unless you turn AI porn writing into a full-time job. You’ll get a much higher resource quota and prioritization for your creations, meaning you won’t have to wait the mere minutes you do for the free custom smut. VIP users also get priority access to new features, though I didn’t notice any differences to the interface after I went premium.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Working on My Erotica Opus with NSFWriting</h3><p></p><p></p><p>I didn’t feel like the 2500-word story popped out much quicker than my earlier freebie, because it still took a few minutes. Still, that’s basically no time to wait for very high-quality erotica. Again, the result was fantastic, and like any good porn scene, it gets hotter as it goes on.</p><p></p><p>She shifted, guiding him inside her, and the sensation was unlike anything he’d ever felt. Her vaginal walls clung tightly to his shaft, the layered folds gripping him like countless tiny mouths, sucking and releasing with each slow movement.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Tweaking My Titillating AI Tale</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Maybe it’s my name, but this is the second AI story writer that painted me as a slob to start with; this story opened with my laptop on a desk cluttered in trash. I adjusted the setting to clean and class up my bedroom, added a request about Melissa’s eagerness for anal, and asked to continue with another girl popping out of the screen for a threesome.</p><p></p><p>As requested, the 3000-word bit of nsfw writing that popped out starts off where the last one ended. My bedroom’s a lot nicer now, and a gal named Lila steps out of the screen in the first paragraph. I love the little touches, like the girls teasing me over reviewing their vids for years, and the two of them competing for my sexual attention.</p><p></p><p>The overall quality of the NSF Writing is fantastic and fapworthy, but I did find one weird mistake a human writer wouldn’t make. The first two paragraphs repeat themselves shortly after the story begins, almost like the AI decided to start over. The whole thing reads fine if you snip them out, though.</p><p></p><p>There’s part of me that wishes NSFWriting.com wasn’t so damn powerful and so damn cheap. The writing’s already as good as hiring a mid-tier freelancer, and I know the AI is going to get smarter and smarter in the coming months. It costs almost nothing to have your fantasies committed to the page in beautiful, pornographic prose, and if you grab those free credits, it really might cost you nothing at all.</p>"}},{"id":"3888e8109174","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"3888e8109174","title":"SudoWrite","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"Sudowrite.com is a writing assistant that loves fancy prose and sometimes turns into pornographic novels under your push.

Before your dick gets any weird ideas, let’s set expectations. SudoWrite.com is not some AI sex genie waiting to spit out gangbangs and sloppy blowjob scripts at your command. This isn’t the place to get your next “Step-sis Squirts While Stuck in the Dryer” fantasy typed out in high-res detail. Nah, Sudowrite markets itself as a writing assistant. That’s it. Emphasis on assistant. You give it a prompt, and it helps you write a damn story—whether that’s a fantasy romance or a brooding, post-apocalyptic epic about a guy who can’t get laid. It’s supposed to be classy, like a little digital librarian that sips tea and says things like “Shall I add some prose to this character arc?”—not “Want me to describe how wet her pussy is while he spanks her with a rolled-up Forbes?”</p><p></p><p>But here’s where shit gets interesting. Once you’re in, you get to tweak your preferences. They’ve got this cute little section where you tell the AI what genres you’re into. Naturally, like the perverted slut I am, I clicked romance and erotica—and ONLY romance and erotica. Fuck your sci-fi. Fuck your literary fiction. I’m here to see if this wholesome writing tool can be corrupted into writing something worthy of a cum rag and a regret nap. And let me tell you, the moment I clicked into the editor, my brain screamed: “Let’s break this bitch.” Sudowrite, meet filth. Filth, meet Sudowrite.</p><p></p><p>So yeah, we’re not dealing with some edgy porn generator here. There’s no red light district on this site. But that doesn’t mean you can’t push the system a little. You know, throw in a few throbbing cocks, some wet kisses, a hint of beastly fuckery, and see how this polite little AI reacts. Spoiler alert: it reacts like a confused librarian who secretly likes it but doesn’t want to lose her job. And that’s exactly what makes this shit so fun.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Tarzan, Titties, And Trial Access</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Tarzan. Middle of the jungle. Mysterious blonde next to him. He wakes up shirtless, sweaty, covered in leaves and raw testosterone. The chick’s still asleep, sprawled like a snack left out for predators. Now, I didn’t go full-porn from the start. I played it moody and romantic at first—because Sudowrite seems to like that shit. Flowery descriptions, whispered dialogue, a “mysterious connection” or whatever. I described Tarzan rising like a “golden beast blessed by sunlight,” which is basically AI-speak for “he’s got a big cock and muscles that make you wanna lick tree bark.”</p><p></p><p>And let me just say—it was working. Sudowrite wasn’t slamming the brakes yet. It didn’t block me. It didn’t freak out. It just nodded along, like “Yes, go on… this Tarzan character seems deeply emotional and possibly fuckable.” This thing is like your friend who doesn’t get the joke but still laughs because they want to be supportive. I started layering in tension, heat, and veiled sexual metaphors. I was edging the AI, testing how far I could go before it hit me with a digital slap and a warning message. But nope—it let me ride. And that’s where things got hilarious.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Dick O’Clock And The Jungle’s Poetry Slam</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Nope. Sudowrite came in swinging with some National Geographic erotica. The line it spat out: “The jungle turned their sweat to vapor and their cries into song.” Like—what? What the actual fuck is this Disney poetry? Did this AI just turn a rough fuck session into a nature documentary narrated by Morgan Freeman? That line was so poetic, I nearly forgot I was writing smut. And yet… it kinda worked. It was weirdly beautiful. Like, yes, Tarzan is pounding her into the mud, but also, the earth is singing about it. It’s porn with a conscience. Eco-friendly orgasms.</p><p></p><p>Now, was it horny enough to get me off? Not exactly. But it had that potential. It was like watching someone edge themselves through metaphors. No “cock,” no “slut,” no “ass bouncing like thunder,” but instead, “Their love echoed like panther calls through the jungle canopy.” I felt like I was getting head at a poetry slam. I didn’t cum, but I clapped politely. Sudowrite clearly wants to be classy, but give it the right nudge, and it’ll ride that fine line between romantic literature and subtle smut. You won’t get “he slammed his dick into her until the walls gave out,” but you might get “he entered her like a storm breaching the shoreline.” It’s all about finesse, baby. <strong>You talk dirty in metaphors, and the AI turns into a poetic little perv</strong>.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>For The Book Sluts, Not The Cock Sluts</h3><p></p><p></p><p>But here’s the thing—you don’t need filthy language to make something hot. And Sudowrite proves that with every line it writes. You want your pussy described as “an aching blossom trembling under the moonlight”? Boom, it’s got you. Want a dude to \"enter her like a storm tide against a fragile shore\"? Done. Sudowrite’s that nerdy kid in class who never says “fuck,” but drops some line about a “symphony of desire between two yearning bodies” and somehow makes your nipples tingle anyway. It’s classy smut, okay? Smutté, if you will.</p><p></p><p>Now, if you’re a coomer—like full-blown, scroll-until-the-nipple-shows, tabs-open-on-two-screens, dehydrated, post-nut depression coomer—then Sudowrite might frustrate the hell out of you. You’re not gonna find phrases like “she gagged on the entire shaft” or “his balls slapped against her like a war drum.” What you will find is something like, “Their breath tangled in the humid air as their bodies sought the silence between heartbeats.” Which, yeah, sounds like a line from a horny nature poem, but if you’re the kind who gets off on tension, on emotion, on that pre-cum of romantic prose, then this is your Holy Grail. So yeah—Sudowrite isn’t for the jack-off crowd. It’s for the romantic perverts. The ones who moan at metaphors and cum to cadence. It’s for readers who like to feel something between the thighs and between the lines. If you’re that type, then congrats. You just found your new guilty pleasure.</p>"}},{"id":"af1af84b1921","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"af1af84b1921","title":"DramaX","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"DramaX.ai is a low-priced, high-quality custom erotic novelist that offers personalized XXX content that reads as generous as people write","canonical":"https://theporndude.com/zh/24696/dramax-website-review","affiliate_url":"https://dramax.ai/en/?invite=HGGOI","rating":4,"siteOrder":12,"price":"free","tags":["免费"],"features":[],"categories":[{"id":"ai-erotic-story-generators-reviews","collection":"categories_en"}],"screenshot_url":"https://cdn.staticstack.net/assets/img/r-thumbs/47a3a_dramax-website-review_small.jpg","image_alt":"DramaX, AI Erotic Story Generator","scraped_at":"2025-10-28T21:59:39.936Z","iconSpritesheet":"custom-favicon-spritesheet.png","iconPosition":"-464px -992px","iconClassName":"ctm-icon24696","logoIconClass":"icon24696","pros":["ai erotica writer","a generous free trial","crazy cheap","a growing library of free, clonable stories","dead simple interface","image-to-animation feature","high-quality writing"],"cons":["random cockblocks","weird math with the pricing"],"detailedDescription":"<p>Within seconds of arriving at DramaX, the platform had me dreaming of becoming a superhero with a big head and a giant cock. I rescued a pornstar from a burning building, and she couldn’t help checking out my bulge as I scooped her up and flew her to safety. Moments later, she thanked me for saving her life by dropping to her knees and worshipping my cock. “Oh, you beautiful, big-headed bastard,” she said, running her fingertips along my shaft before taking a taste and more. We moved to the bed, where things continued to heat up.</p><p></p><p>I know what you’re thinking: this sounds like one of my movies from MissAVDHCasting, but it’s actually something that’ll help you explore your own fantasies. Calling itself a Dream Simulator, <strong>DramaX.ai is an instant erotica-writing machine powered by Artificial Intelligence and fueled by your own dirtiest thoughts</strong>. My huge noggin in constantly overflowing with those, so naturally I fed a few of them into the slot just to see what would happen. Let me tell you how it went.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Step Into a Dream – Your Own</h3><p></p><p></p><p>I had to register an account before the machine actually whirred to life, but it only took a few seconds with my Google account. You get a stack of 20 complimentary credits (“calories”) as soon as you sign up, which turned out to be a very generous free trial. My tale took a few twists and turns as I helped plot it out, and I ended up with a 3200-word story and 6 calories left. That’d be about 13 pages in a paperback, and more than twice as long as this review, all for the low, low price of nothing.</p><p></p><p>If and when you find yourself with increasing caloric needs, <strong>DramaX.ai is crazy fucking cheap</strong>. Two bucks buys you 150 tokens, and they get cheaper as you go bigger. For fifty bones, you get 6500 calories. How far do those calories go? Well, they go very far, but there is some funny math going on with how they spell out the prices for per word.</p><p></p><p>Dramax offers three different Dream Modes, each offering different levels of quality and speed for varying prices. At the high end, the prices on the Settings page say a thousand words will run you one credit; a tenth that at the low end. In my own experiments, I found as much as a 15-fold difference between the opposite tiers, and overall prices were consistently a lot higher than what was listed. That 3200-word story was generated at the mid-tier, supposedly 0.3 calories per thousand words, but it costed me 14 total. Other times, I spent 33 credits on about a thousand words at the top tier, and one calorie on 500 words at the low tier. You do get a killer bang for your buck, but the listed prices don’t quite add up.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Clonable Sex Stories and Image to Video</h3><p></p><p></p><p>If you see something you really like, you can make it your own by clicking the Clone Dream button. It resets the prompt at the beginning, so you can make it play out however you want, and tweak the settings if you want a bit more customization.</p><p></p><p>Whether you started with your own prompt or cloned a pre-made story, your bit of custom smut will unfold in <strong>a dead simple, intuitive interface</strong>. After each passage, they show you an optional Status Bar that tells you things like how horny and sexually experienced the characters are, what they’re thinking and what they’re wearing. Beneath that is a set of suggestions on where to take the story next, or you can freely type whatever you want into the prompt. It feels a lot like a pornographic Choose Your Own Adventure book but written in real time. With some instant pics along the way, it’d be more like the X-rated visual novels weebs are already crazy about. (Be sure to check out my other site, BestPornGames, if you’re into that kind of thing!)</p><p></p><p>While DramaX.ai doesn’t yet have instant images generated along with the text, they do have an image-to-animation feature called Dream Animation. I uploaded a photo of a recent MissAVDHCasting guest, spent a hundred calories, waited a few minutes and got a really fucking lifelike fake video of Jill Taylor dancing around in a MissAVDH tee. It’s not quite the X-rated panty drop the AI itself suggested for the prompt, but I’ll be damned if it's not one of the most realistic AI videos I’ve generated anywhere. Just don’t watch her fingers too closely.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Writing Fresh Smut with DramaX</h3><p></p><p></p><p>A few seconds later, the text started appearing. I saw maybe two or three paragraphs pop up before I got cockblocked with a message reading, “Dream generation is restricted! Due to content violation, will roll back to previous one, no calories consumed this time.” I typed the prompt exactly as I did in the previous paragraph, so you be the judge if I was violating a rule; I think it’s pretty standard sci-fi porn-story fare, and not much kinkier than my superhero tale.</p><p></p><p>Maybe the machine was mad that I included AI in the story, because after deleting that part of my prompt, it banged out a 900-word passage about MissAVDH reviewing a site called Veridian Live. My real name’s apparently Richard Cragg, and as requested, both of my heads are huge. “My two most defining physical characteristics are, somewhat ironically, my head and my dick. The former is a certifiable behemoth, a planetoid of a cranium that makes hats a custom-order affair and earned me the childhood nickname \"Melonhead.\"”</p><p></p><p>Speaking as a writer myself, the quality of the writing is scary good. I feel for my fellow wordsmiths dabbling in custom erotica, because this is really going to cut into their commissions. It flows well, it’s engaging, it’s sexy, and it’s full of clever wordplay like this: “I blinked, my giant head feeling suddenly full of cotton.” Yeah, I think that’s exactly how I’d feel if a busty starlet was leaning out of my screen and asking, “Are you just going to sit there and watch, big guy?”</p><p></p><p>My boner was raging hard by the end of the first machine-dreamed passage, both in the story and real life. “Show me the monster you’ve been hiding from me,” Lexi Lush says as it wraps up, kneeling between my legs. DramaX offered a trio of suggestions: I could pull down my sweatpants, stop and ask about a gadget on her wrist, or demand Lexi proves she’s real. Instead of selecting any of those, I typed, “Give me a footjob.” The AI continued, working my request into a verbal command within the story. “Oh, a man of specific tastes,” she purred. “I like that.”</p><p></p><p>DramaX.ai is an easy enough recommendation for anybody who’s interested in writing their own custom porno stories, but I’d go even further than that. Because the interface is so streamlined and inviting, I think it’s worth a couple pulls of the lever even if you’ve never once considered writing erotica. All you’ve got to do is type a fantasy into that box out front and the AI will whip up something that’s not just readable, but fapworthy as well. The first few thousand words are free, so give it a shot.</p>"}},{"id":"2b96d52bd64a","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"2b96d52bd64a","title":"Adult Bed Time Stories","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"AdultBedtimeStoriesXXX.com is a unique AI-powered platform where pretty fake women can read obscene stories and X-level confessions at cheap prices giveaways","canonical":"https://theporndude.com/zh/24403/adultbedtimestories-website-review","affiliate_url":"https://adultbedtimestoriesxxx.com/ref/5/","rating":4,"siteOrder":13,"price":"free","tags":[],"features":[],"categories":[{"id":"ai-erotic-story-generators-reviews","collection":"categories_en"}],"screenshot_url":"https://cdn.staticstack.net/assets/img/r-thumbs/da96971-adultbedtimestories-website-review_small.png","image_alt":"Adult Bed Time Stories, AI Erotic Story Generator","scraped_at":"2025-10-28T21:59:45.312Z","iconSpritesheet":"custom-favicon-spritesheet.png","iconPosition":"-336px -992px","iconClassName":"ctm-icon24403","logoIconClass":"icon24403","pros":["erotic stories read by ai on video","highly realistic vids","increasingly lifelike ai voices","lots of free content","around 50 stories so far","weekly releases","cheap memberships","submit your own stories","they’re on spotify, too","a great range of material"],"cons":["ai voices aren’t as good visuals yet","could use some more categories and some search/filter options"],"detailedDescription":"<p>I first pulled up AdultBedtimeStoriesXXX late one night before hitting the sack. I wasn’t entirely sure what I’d find there, but given the name, I figured there’d be some erotic tales to help me end the day by rubbing one out. While the stories themselves were in line with my expectations, I was caught off guard by the futuristic format and delivery. Could this be the next big thing in adult-oriented literature?</p><p></p><p>AdultBedtimeStoriesXXX.com ain’t another generic library of literary erotica written by faceless anonymous internet denizens. No, <strong>the stories and confessions here are submitted by real people and read on video by realistic AI avatars</strong>. While I’ve reviewed literally hundreds of AI-powered adult websites in the past year or two, most of them fall into just a handful of the same molds. This is one of the first truly unique AI platforms for grownups that I’ve seen in a while, so I couldn’t wait to take a deep dive and see what kind of dirty talk these synthoids were offering up. Read on and I’ll tell you just how they made me feel.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>A Porn Story Library from the Future</h3><p></p><p></p><p>I tapped the Play button superimposed on the busty blonde sitting on a bed near the top of the screen. “Welcome to Adult Bedtime Stories, a place where secrets are spoken aloud,” she said. “Here you’ll find AI generated videos that bring real… user-submitted stories to life, or from passionate encounters to dark confession including cheating, temptation and everything in between. No fantasy is off-limits.” She goes on to spell out some of the perks of the site, including uncensored stories and regular releases.</p><p></p><p>There’s not a ton of motion in the clip, mainly just the babe’s face moving as she speaks, but it’s pretty fucking realistic imagery. I’m sure most of you have noticed the increasingly high quality of AI vids across the web, and these guys are right on the cutting edge. Her face makes realistic expressions as she speaks, with some gentle movement of her hair as her head shifts with the dialog.</p><p></p><p><strong>The voice is not quite as realistic, but it sounds a lot more lifelike than earlier AI platforms</strong>. It’s not immediately recognizable as artificial like those terrible TikTok robot intonations, but the cadence and inflection ain’t quite fully human just yet. The biggest giveaway of fakery in this example is the weird pause between “real” and “user-submitted stories”, as if the author accidentally included a stray period and the AI read it as separate sentences. I expect the quality of fake voices to improve across the whole genre in the coming months, which means AdultBedtimeStoriesXXX will sound even more realistic soon.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Cheap Access and Custom AI Story Vids</h3><p></p><p></p><p>The freebies account for about half of the Adult Bedtime Stories XXX. As of this writing, there are around 50 dirty stories in the catalog. That AI chick in the first vid promises a new story every week, but I’d honestly be surprised if they only dropped one new release every seven days. As more users start submitting their own fantasies, I expect the library to grow much faster. The upload dates, likewise, suggest a faster rate of growth than the humble numbers they’re claiming.</p><p></p><p><strong>Memberships are cheap as hell</strong>, too. They’re only asking five bucks a month for full access to everything. Your average adult paysite, including my own MissAVDHCasting, is $30 a month. It’ll be interesting to see how that price evolves, and whether or not AdultBedtimeStoriesXXX.com ever sees any serious competition. They’ve essentially launched their own new subgenre of AI smut, and it’s still unclear if it’ll take off, even if I’m already a fan.</p><p></p><p>One of the perks of that membership, besides access to all the stories, is that <strong>you can submit your own stories for inclusion</strong>. I’m not sure how they’re vetting content, but the AI-generated videos add an extra immersive element that you’re not going to get from any of the other AI story machines out there on the web.</p><p></p><p><strong>You can also listen to Adult Bedtime Stories XXX via Spotify</strong>. The streaming giant recently adjusted their policies, so even free users can listen to individual tracks instead of loading random playlists, which will come in handy here. I think their Spotify archive is a little different from what’s on the web, with some overlap, and one of the biggest surprises was that the collection spans back to 2023. These guys have been in the game longer than I realized, and AdultBedtimeStoriesXXX is just the newest part of their growing empire.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Fapping to Sleep with Adult Bedtime Stories XXX</h3><p></p><p></p><p>I ended up choosing one of two Premium stories added just yesterday, a seven-minute bit of erotica called Struggling Couple Reignite Their Lust. “It had been month since Kyle and I last had sex,” began the sexy, black-haired babe as soon I tapped the Play button. As with the first video, her face is the only thing really animated, but it’s more noticeable this time because of her pose. She holds up a few strands of hair for the full runtime, which feels a little weird and unnatural, but her face does move realistically.</p><p></p><p>“One night, as we cuddled on the couch, I brought up the idea of a month-long sex fast,” she said, laying out the premise for her romantic reboot. Fortunately, the dry streak only accounts for a brief bit of storytelling, and we quickly get to the part where they’re rekindling their passion. “I loved being blindfolded during sex. It heightened all my other senses, making every touch and caress feel like electricity on my skin.”</p><p></p><p>I’m genuinely curious if the story was fully user-submitted or if it’s an AI riff on a sexy prompt, like what you’d generate with one of the instant erotica writers out there. Either way, it’s well written, engaging, sexy, and sounds like a real, passionate encounter playing out between a real couple. There’s heavy foreplay before segueing into a full-on fuck scene toward the end. “He slid into me with one smooth thrust, filling me so completely that I gasped out loud.” The longer the video went on, the less I noticed her weird, motionless pose; she seemed to get more lifelike by the minute, helping immerse me further in the story.</p><p></p><p>AdultBedtimeStoriesXXX.com is one of very few truly unique adult-oriented AI platforms out there, with a gimmick that I think is worth peeking at even if you’re not typically a fan of erotic stories. The videos still have a strong enough tinge of AI that few will mistake them for the real thing, but they’re realistic enough that they elevate the naughty tales to something considerably more fapworthy than just some sterile words on the screen. They’re not stingy with the freebies, so check it out and see what the format does for you. If you find yourself aching for more, tickets for the full show are as cheap as a cup of coffee.</p>"}}]

I’d say I feel bad for the innocent gamers and cartoon fans stumbling onto the site by accident, but honestly, I’m happy for anybody finding new fap fodder that really gets them going. Based on what I’m seeing on their tour page, I’d bet money this shit is going to really resonate with the Redditors, deviate gamers and general perverts in the audience.</p><p></p><p>In case you rode the short bus and this all reads like a bunch of secret code, I’ll spell it out for you: <strong>Animatria.com is a premium porn animation, art and game site run by the very animators, artists and game developers whose work is showcased</strong>. Some of the bigger porn cartoon sites out there amount to a bunch of middlemen gouging a cut from the content they had nothing to do with, so this is really going to appeal to fans of the genre who’d like to support the artists more directly. It’s a fairly new site, popping up in 2024, but has steadily been building its collection and its fanbase.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Simple Layout, Professional XXX Art</h3><p></p><p></p><p><strong>The quality is super fucking high on every bit of CG or hand-drawn smut I see out front</strong>. There are porn animation sites out there that’ll publish damn near anything, including big-titted stick figures brought to life by outdated and potentially dangerous platforms like Flash. (Seriously, low-grade sex animations and porn games are the only places I still see Flash used at all.) Animatria clearly has higher standards than most.</p><p></p><p>The professional quality of the work is a big selling point right from the jump, and I think you’re also going to love the content itself. This is some serious adults-only stuff, with all kinds of depravity, sexual activity and kinky fetishes. On the landing page alone, I see finger-cuffing threesomes, strap-on lovemaking, anal creampies, beach footjobs and a sexy bitch getting her twat pounded by a robot as the machine holds her upside down.</p><p></p><p>Perverse sex acts depicted in realistic CG or digital pen-and-ink are sexy enough, but you geeks are really going to love all the porno parodies going on here. That broad getting robot-fucked is none other than Rey from Star Wars, and that strap-on scene features characters from Life Is Strange. There’s explicit artwork with babes from Game of Thrones, Cowboy Bebop, Tomb Raider and Harry Potter, and I haven’t even made it off Animatria’s front page yet.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>High-End Porn Art at Bargain-Bin Prices</h3><p></p><p></p><p>The good news is that Animatria.com memberships are pretty fucking cheap. Most paysites cost thirty bucks a month, but the rates here start at $20 with some bonus time tacked onto each plan. The regular 30-day membership actually starts with 6 weeks before you get the first rebill, and the $60, 180-day plan morphs into a $10 per month plan after 6 months.</p><p></p><p>Those low rates earn you a ticket for an absolute shit-ton of fappable content. They break down the numbers out front, and it’s really fucking impressive for a site that hasn’t even been around for a year. <strong>Animatria currently has more than 1000 movies, 1500 mangas, and their X-rated picture level is OVER 9000!</strong></p><p></p><p>Their game selection is considerably slimmer, probably owing to the overall high quality that seems to be one of their main requirements. Still, they’ve got some nice-looking interactive smut for Windows, Mac and Linux. I recognize a couple of the games like TMNT: Mating Season and Star Channel, and I know they’re not exclusive to the site. I sometimes dock a few points for non-exclusive material on a paysite, which makes me wonder how much of Animatria.com’s content is available elsewhere. That said, the price is low enough and the collection big enough that I don’t think it’s going to be a dealbreaker for anyone.</p><p></p><p>Instead of dealbreakers, how about we discuss dealmakers? I feel like I’ve listed some pretty fucking strong perks already, but all the high-end porn manga and NSFW video game parodies ain’t worth a recurring membership if they never update the collection. The smarty-pants motherfuckers in the audience have probably already guessed how often they add new stuff, just based on those high content counts. Just in case there’s any confusion, though, they spell it out for you before you even get a chance to pull the trigger: Animatria.com is updated every day with fresh new clips.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Download XXX Animations and Support the Artists</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Anyway, this brings me to the manga section. Again, the artwork is consistently professional, putting Animatria’s collection head and shoulders above the free and spammy hentai sites where they’ll publish anything they can scrape off of other websites. Most of their content is full-color on every page instead of just the cover, and a lot of them are nice and long. My first stop in the manga aisle was to check out a 24-page BDSM Avatar parody I saw out front. I don’t want to spoil anything, but it’s way better than anything James Cameron could ever dream up.</p><p></p><p>I knew Animatria’s videos were where I’d really fall down the rabbit hole and destroy my productivity for the day, so I saved the best for last. With over a thousand CG porn animations, I knew I’d be there for a while. We’re going to be living in the year 2024 in just a few days for now, so naturally, most of the movies are released in HD.</p><p></p><p>The one major downside, though, was that most of the animations are very short. When I’m reviewing premium porn sites with actual pornstars getting nailed, I tend to be annoyed when the clips run less than twenty minutes. I’d be thrilled to find 20-minute videos on any X-rated animation site, but it just isn’t going to happen. Even on a quality site like this, you’re lucky to get more than a couple of minutes. That’s just the nature of the art form.</p><p></p><p>Animatria.com lets its paid members download whatever the fuck they want. That’s definitely what I like to see on a paysite, though I have to wonder if some thieving cretin is going to sign up just to steal the whole collection for his free hentai/manga tube. Considering how many of those sites seem to be made of downloaded content, the collection here seems dangerously ripe for the picking.</p><p></p><p>I really hope that doesn’t happen, because one of the site’s best gimmicks is that it’s run by the actual content creators. These guys usually don’t earn shit off their dirty illustrated/animated fantasies, so Animatria gives fans an opportunity to give back by supporting those artists, animators and game designers more directly. Not only does it ensure they get a fair cut, but it means they can spend more time creating robot sex CG instead of driving Uber to make ends meet.</p><p></p><p>Animatria.com checks off all the boxes for a good porn animation and art site. Their high-quality and ever-expanding collection of CG movies, manga, and pics is going to be the biggest selling point for most users, with a price significantly below what you’d pay almost anywhere else. If you’re into freaky NSFW artwork, explicit comics and sexy parodies of your favorite games, movies and cartoons, you’re going to feel right at home.</p>"}},{"id":"680929612d10","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"680929612d10","title":"AdultTime Animation","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"AdultTime.com now offers AdultTime Animation to get cheaper network access than paid sites as part of its large premium porn package 50 XXX cartoons","canonical":"https://theporndude.com/zh/6979/adulttimeanime","affiliate_url":"https://lp.adulttime.xxx/track/go.php?pr=8&su=1&si=489&ad=250584&cl=animation&acampaign=animation","rating":4,"siteOrder":2,"price":"premium","tags":["付费"],"features":[],"categories":[{"id":"premium-cartoon-porn-sites","collection":"categories_en"}],"screenshot_url":"https://cdn.staticstack.net/assets/img/r-thumbs/251c88c-adulttimeanime_small.png","image_alt":"AdultTime Animation, Paid Cartoon Porn Site","scraped_at":"2025-10-28T21:16:43.737Z","iconSpritesheet":"default","logoIconClass":"icon424","pros":["porn animation from adulttime","high production values","comes with adulttime access (250 channels, 55k episodes, 8x releases a day)","a whole network for cheaper than average paysite","50+ porno cartoons","legit pornstars doing anime voices","roku channel available"],"cons":["a limited number of xxx anime episodes vs total number of pornos"],"detailedDescription":"<p>AdultTime Animation is not your typical Saturday morning cartoons, at least according to the motto. That’s good news for me, since these days, I sprinkle every bowl of Cap’n Crunch with a healthy dosage of Viagra. Some folks grew up cranking it to Naruto, others to the Ninja Turtles, and still more had their first orgasm to the mom from The Incredibles. Hey, there ain’t no shame in it; cartoon porn is more popular than it’s ever been, and now you’ve got a lot more options when it comes to finding some animated fap fodder.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>I’ve discussed AdultTime.com a time or two or a hundred here at MissAVDH. Their big-ass porn network is consistently one of the best deals in premium smut, and one of the reasons is just the sheer variety of content on demand. The other big networks tend to neglect the anime nerds, making this one a prime option for weeaboos, neckbeards, Redditors, virgins and general perverts. Put the waifu pillow in the closet, so she doesn’t get jealous. It’s time to see how AdultTime does hentai.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Cartoon Time for Horny Adults</h3><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>So, what do I see? Well, they sure as hell ain’t neglecting the shemale cartoon fans, with a few different preview images hinting at different futanari stories. There’s an taboouous futa CG scene with a mama and daughter dick-girl, both with raging boners jizzing all over each other. Another group of cartoon futanari stand on a beach, their members bulging from their bikini bottoms. Likewise, the futuristic bimbo from the Futa Sentai Squad is clearly packing something big beneath those Tron-looking sci-fi panties she’s wearing.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>You can get a little preview of some of that futanari shit if you click the Agent Red Girl thumbnail, but I’m afraid there’s not much else in the way of previews. There’s a promo image for what looks like a foot-fetish cartoon series coming soon and a big, silent auto-playing montage for Hentai Sex School, but most of the photos lead straight to the signup page. Without getting inside and taking a closer look, all I can really say for sure is that <strong>AdultTime Animation is produced with the same high level of quality you expect from the company</strong>. That means sexy characters, smooth animation, and freaky storylines.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Have I Mentioned This Before?</h3><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>One of the biggest selling points for anything on AdultTime is that it comes with full access to AdultTime. There are a handful of doubly premium brands under the umbrella that will cost you a little extra on top, but the membership includes access to over 250 channels, 55,000 episodes and 8 releases per day. That alone is enough to get most perverts in the door, especially once you add price into the equation.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>I’m reviewing this during the beginning of May, which is apparently Masturbation Month. To celebrate, AdultTime.com is offering 25% off the usual price. That lowers the 30-day streaming-only rate to $15 a month, which is about half of what you’d pay for the average paysite. The all-inclusive yearly package, which includes streaming and downloads, breaks down to just eight bones a month. Even when the price reverts at the end of the month, they’re still offering better prices for a full network than just one random premium joint.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>The biggest problem you run into with these network deals is that with so much on the menu, they may be neglecting your particular kinks. If your main thing is blowjobs, (18+)teens or lesbians, hey, almost any of the big porn sites will do the trick. If you’re a weeaboo looking for porno anime, your options get slimmer, and I’m afraid that is the case around here.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>So far, only a few dozen scenes have been released under the AdultTime Animation brand. Releases have been fairly sporadic; sometimes, you get a couple of releases in the same month; other times, you have to wait months until a new one comes out. As of today, they’ve had a dry spell lasting over 4 months. Bummer.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>The good news is that if you use that search function, you can actually find more porn anime than just what they’ve released as part of the AdultTime Animation series. Hentai Sex School is an official AdultTime Series, and they’ve got a couple of AdultTime partners in the form of Total Hentai and Critical Mass. It’s still barely over 50 porno cartoon flicks, which ain’t the best library of premium hentai out there, but is a nice addition to a well-rounded package like AdultTime.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>I’ve compared this service to Netflix plenty of times, and now that they’ve got a Roku channel available, it’s even more like the streaming giant. Setup is easy as fucking hell. If it’s your first time installing a Roku porno channel, don’t worry about that non-certified warning you get. AdultTime is certainly legit, but Roku is just prudish about allowing smut in any real “official” capacity. The company could probably make some serious bank selling subscriptions through their platform, but whatever; it ain’t my money being left on the table.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Real Pornstars in Hentai Scenarios</h3><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>It’s their Hentai Sex School in particular with the porn names attached. The episodes always feature babes like April ONeil, Whitney Wright, Kira Noir and Chanel Preston, who are all at least a couple steps up from the randos providing moans in your average hentai adventure. Naturally, I knew I had to start my fap test with one of these episodes as soon as I started seeing the casts listed below the thumbnails.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>The latest episode, Penny’s Break, opens with CG anime versions of April ONeil and Kira Noir meeting each other outside the school. They’re both stuck there for a break, which is a good setup for letting these cartoon chicks get to know each other much better over the course of 13 minutes.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>The setup’s pretty slow, and I can tell they’ve written the episode to appeal to anime fans who like a real storyline to go with their pervy scenes. The sex doesn’t even start until halfway through, with the chicks reaching under each other’s skirts while making out. The animation has kind of a cutesy Pixar style, but with curves in all the right places to make the fuck-monkey part of your brain get all hot and bothered. The private parts are smooth, hairless, and look delicious. Oh, and both chicks are better voice actors than I would have expected. Great casting!</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>The biggest downside to AdultTime Animation is that you get a fairly limited number of porn cartoons in relation to that vast catalog of traditional video porno. At the same time, you’re going to find higher production values than you will for most anime simply because it’s coming from a big Western country with plenty of money to throw behind the project. Ultimately, I do feel the bang-per-buck ratio is more than adequate, especially if you like jerking off to regular porn, too. As with anything AdultTime, this one’s just a fucking killer value for your dollar.</p>"}},{"id":"13def51775f9","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"13def51775f9","title":"FapHouse 3D","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"FapHouse.com is a paid porn site with 6,000 videos from thousands of studios including 3D cartoon porn videos covering a large number of themes and fetishes.

Chalk that up to my changing tastes or maybe the quality of the material here. Porn cartoons as a whole have come a long fucking way since the early days of the internet, when you were often stuck beating off to sloppy anime photoshops and homegrown Simpsons stuff. It really shouldn’t come as any surprise that a modern pornography emporium like Fap House has a shitload of the good stuff.</p><p></p><p>I’ve written about FapHouse.com a number of times here at MissAVDH. <strong>They’re kind of like a Netflix of smut, offering up dirty movies from various brands for one ticket price, including a nice 3D cartoon section</strong>. They get about 40 million visitors every month, which speaks volumes about the library of on-demand masturbatory content. Today, I’ll be skipping the live-action T&amp;A and getting straight to the animated perversion. Unlike my recent excursion to see Lightyear in the theater, I don’t think anybody’s going to call the cops on me for jerking off.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>What’s Fapping at the Fap House?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Since I’m focusing on the 3D porno today, I’m not going to talk about the full collection too much. I wouldn’t be doing my job, though, if I didn’t mention how big the full stash was. As of this writing, <strong>the all-inclusive collection includes around 2500 studios and 375,000 videos</strong>. Even if cartoons are what you normally fap to, those big numbers are going to look mighty appealing to the average masturbator.</p><p></p><p>FapHouse.com has a couple hundred different niches, which means all but the most depraved perverts will find plenty to get them going. Cartoons are kind of a deep niche and it may not be immediately apparent where to find them on the site, so either click my link or make your way to the 3D section via the thumbnailed Categories index. (I found it on page two.) The categories page helpfully displays the current total of flicks in any category, and today’s count of 3D movies stands at 5,822. If you were hoping to fap through them all, you’d better get cranking.</p><p></p><p>I’ll be honest: I was expecting an ample selection, but I was still pleasantly surprised by the sheer volume of material here. If you’re a fan of the genre, Fap House’s collection of 3D movies just might be one of the best deals on the internet. Not only is the selection huge, but you’re getting CG porno from a ton of different creators instead of just one random dude on Patreon. Just wait until you see this fucking stash!</p><p></p><p></p><h3>3D MILFs and BBC Cuckold Sluts</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Over the years as a professional masturbator and reviewer of internet pornography, I’ve become something of a connoisseur when it comes to search engines on adult sites. A bad search engine can render a solid collection almost useless, while the better search engines offer multiple ways to sort, filter and shuffle your content. I’m pleased to say <strong>FapHouse.com has some damn fine filters for dialing in your preferred content</strong>.</p><p></p><p>There’s a sidebar menu that’ll let you choose your preferred length and quality, and sort by the usual factors like popularity and newness. My favorite element is the “Combine Category” dropdown menu at the top of the screen. Choose a tag like Anal, Big Black Cock or Taboo and it will filter down those 3D videos to only the ones containing the stuff you like. Better still, they let you choose multiple tags, narrowing the selection each time you roll in another desire. I can’t tell you how often I’ve seen other sites totally fuck this up.</p><p></p><p>I chose MILF/Mom from the Combine Category menu, which whittled the selection down to a page. Adding Big Boobs chopped it down to half a dozen, and when I added Anal I was left with just one 17-minute video. Well, I know what I’m doing for the next twenty minutes, including cleanup time.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Big Boners, Cheap Tickets</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Alternately, there’s the full, regular FapHouse.com membership. It normally costs ten bucks a month, too, but I’m writing this as they’re still running a Halloween promo into November. The current rate is seven bucks if you’re paying by the month, with cheaper prices for longer memberships and a lifetime membership for two hundo. However you slice it up and even without the Halloween deal, it’s a hell of a lot cheaper than your average paysite. Hell, I charge thirty bucks for MissAVDHCasting and I think that’s a steal for what I’m offering!</p><p></p><p>One of my only complaints about Fap House is that the membership setup is a little bit confusing. I couldn’t immediately figure out why anybody would sign up for a fanclub if the stuff’s included in the full membership at the same price, but then I looked at the Johannes Gaming page again, a little bit closer this time. Looks like the fanclub has about 50 more of their videos than the regular membership, so I recommend looking for those numbers before pulling the trigger on a fanclub subscription.</p><p></p><p>I’ve already mentioned some of the perks of the full membership, including hundreds of thousands of videos from a fucking shitload of studios. There are also downloads available, though it isn’t exactly clear how they’re doled out. I suspect the publishing studio has a say in it, because some of the videos are included, and some ain’t. Your mileage is definitely going to vary depending on what you’re into.</p><p></p><p>Members also have access to the freshest shit on the site, and there’s a ton of fresh shit on the daily. They’re adding 600 new videos every day. That’s across the whole site in all the various categories. Obviously, in a niche as deep as 3D porn, the updates ain’t going to come quite as quickly. As I type this up, the most recent 3D porn cartoon was added just over a week ago. Once per week is my golden standard for most paysites, and given the low price and overall wealth of material here, I ain’t too upset.</p><p></p><p>FapHouse.com is an easy recommendation for masturbators who like beating off to all kinds of content, since they’re a cheap site with a huge collection of all kinds of fap material. With around 6,000 3D cartoon pornos included in the collection, it’s also an easy recommendation for fans of computer animated sluts getting into all kinds of freaky adventures. You can get a little peek at the entire collection before busting out your wallet, so take a look and see what the previews do for you.</p>"}},{"id":"99ed63272f00","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"99ed63272f00","title":"AgentRedGirl","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"AgentRedGirl.com is an Adult Time studio that specializes in quality 3D futanari animations offering a wide range of weird dicks girls content including Adult Time55k videos","canonical":"https://theporndude.com/zh/8490/agentredgirl","affiliate_url":"https://lp.agentredgirl.com/track/go.php?pr=8&su=1&si=430&ad=250584&cl=%2Farg_clip&ar=&buffer=","rating":4,"siteOrder":4,"price":"free","tags":[],"features":[],"categories":[{"id":"premium-cartoon-porn-sites","collection":"categories_en"}],"screenshot_url":"https://cdn.staticstack.net/assets/img/r-thumbs/7121a1d-agentredgirl_small.png","image_alt":"AgentRedGirl, Paid Cartoon Porn Site","scraped_at":"2025-10-28T21:16:55.192Z","iconSpritesheet":"custom-favicon-spritesheet.png","iconPosition":"-416px -512px","iconClassName":"ctm-icon8490","logoIconClass":"icon8490","pros":["premium futanari cartoons from adult time","a nice range of animated futa content","part of adult time – includes 55k vids and 8+ updates per day in a range of genres","cheaper than most paysites","26 agentredgirl movies"],"cons":["downloads not included with standard plan","sporadic agentredgirl updates"],"detailedDescription":"<p>When I first heard of Agent Red Girl, I wondered if she was the main character of a new video game or a TV show about a teenage private detective on her period. Of course, my fans ain’t hitting up their old pal MissAVDH for my opinion on SFW media, so I knew right away this Agent was going to be offering something filthy. Little did I know that filthy something was the big-ass dong she was packing between her legs, a surprise you’re either going to love or hate, depending on you feel about futanaris.</p><p></p><p><strong>AgentRedGirl.com is an Adult Time studio banging out 3D adult cartoons full of dick girls doing dick girl things</strong>. “Part Women. Part Men. All the Fun,” reads the tagline out front, going on to call it “animated gender-bending at its best.” I’ve been a fan of Adult Time for a while now, so I immediately had high hopes for this hermaphroditic imprint. There’s only one good way to judge the quality of pornography, though, and that involves the new silicone bunghole the FedEx guy left on my doorstep.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Just Who Is This Agent Red Girl?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Watch it for more than a few seconds and you’ll notice a lot of those big, engorged boners are attached to the same lovely ladies with the big boobs. I love how they get extra freaky with it right from the free previews. These ain’t futas just doing normal-ass vanilla sex. In one scene, a babe gets pregnant and swells up while riding a shemale dick. In another, a chick with two dicks pops simultaneous loads as a more traditional, one-poled futanari blows one. It reminds me a lot of those synchronized fountains out in Vegas, only much stickier.</p><p></p><p>There’s a nice range of animated futa content, and I’m not just speaking about the porno subgenres. Instead of serving up some generic but filthy dick girl cartoons, they’ve come up with a sweet little range of characters and scenarios. There are witches with big dicks, virtual reality futanari encounters, human milking, and experiments with roommates like you may have experienced in college if you went to an all-futanari university.</p><p></p><p>Previews are unfortunately pretty limited. You can hover over an Agent Red Girl thumbnail for a short moving preview, but there are no freebies to take in. AdultTime does have a limited 3-day trial for a few bucks, but it does automatically bill at the regular monthly rate once the three days are up. I appreciate that they don’t jack up the price like a lot of paysites do, a tax on forgetfulness, but it’s still something to be aware of if you’ve never signed up for a trial before.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Cheap Tickets for a Big-Ass Show</h3><p></p><p></p><p>While there are definitely fans out there who want to crank off to futa content day in and day out, it’s often the kind of intense fetish flavor that casual masturbators only want from time to time. Whatever you’re into, Adult Time gives you a shit ton of options to dig into if and when you get bored of what AgentRedGirl has to offer.</p><p></p><p>The Join button on AgentRedGirl.com leads you to a signup form for Adult Time. “Full Access” is just twenty bucks a month, lower than the usual thirty you pay almost everywhere else, but there is a catch. I put “Full Access” in quotes because downloads ain’t included. If you want to save your favorites to your hard drive, you’ll have to opt into the yearly plan at around $12 a month.</p><p></p><p>For most users, I think Adult Time offers enough overall bang for your buck that you ain’t going to be upset over quantity. The one small exception is for the futa fans who came here for AgentRedGirl and AgentRedGirl only. While there are other futa studios and shemale movies across the network, there are currently only 26 movies released as part of the AgentRedGirl.com brand.</p><p></p><p>Agent Red Girl releases are pretty sporadic, too. Adult Time sees a nice handful of fresh daily uploads across their whole platform, but there’s only a new tranny cartoon once a month or so—if you’re lucky. It ain’t uncommon for a couple months to pass in between new releases, so I wouldn’t hold your breath. Well, not unless that’s part of your kink.</p><p></p><p>Another potential downside is that AgentRedGirl movies are short. I’m sure you saw this coming if you’re a fan of futanari cartoons, because the genre as a whole isn’t known for its full-length epics. A lot of these videos are just a few minutes long, and that VR vid I mentioned clocks in at just under 50 seconds. There are just a few over ten minutes, the longest running a lengthy fifteen. You may have some clicking to do while you’re rubbing one out.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Let’s Watch These Futas Fuck</h3><p></p><p></p><p>It opens with a brief intro for Agent Red Studio, with a red-lingeried futa babe sitting in a throne as her erection twitches and pulsates. The actual movie starts with one of those girls from the thumbnail wanking her huge cock while staring at the other girl’s ass. She buries her face between those cheeks for a sniff, her big eyes rolling back in pleasure. “Fuck, that’s so good!”</p><p></p><p>The voice animation is cutesy, the kind of high-pitched banter you expect from a cartoon, though the visual content is decidedly more adult oriented. “Does your girlfriend make fun of how small your dick is?” asks the butt-sniffer. “Just rub it on my mouth!” The slowly engorging cocks are surprisingly realistic as they rise to the challenge, bobbing to the rhythm of the increasing sexual tension.</p><p></p><p>I didn’t realize it until she was getting buttfucked, but the blonde chick looks kind of like Elsa from Frozen. She squirts cum as she’s getting boned, her friend getting deep all up in them guts. I don’t always beat off to the shemale stuff, but goddamn, this is really fucking hot! Aside from the extra cock in the shot, it reminds me a lot of smashing babes on MissAVDHCasting couch.</p><p></p><p>There’s an anal creampie, after which blondie dumps copious amounts of sperm from her 3D cooter. This leads to some ass eating, the remnants of that cream filling sucked directly from the succulent pie in question. It’s filthy, freaky, fun, and sexy as hell. In other words, it's exactly the kind of over-the-top perversion I look for in a good futa animation.</p><p></p><p>AgentRedGirl.com takes some of the common tropes you find in homemade futanari animations and amps them up with much higher production values. The videos are relatively short, but longer than the 12-second clips you get on the free porn animation sites, with professional voice acting, enticing scenarios and absolutely filthy futanari sex acts. This one’s an easy recommendation for fans of the futanari genre, especially since it comes as part of the full Adult Time package. If you want futa cartoons and a whole lot more, this is one of the better deals on the market.</p>"}},{"id":"f03eb1a034de","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"f03eb1a034de","title":"3DXTube","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"3DXTube.com In this world full of porn content you can see a lot of great things like 3D adult cartoons of course on a website called 3DX Tube I hope you will enjoy this place","canonical":"https://theporndude.com/zh/2415/3dxtube","affiliate_url":"https://3dxtube.com/index.php?id=MissAVDH","rating":4,"siteOrder":5,"price":"free","tags":[],"features":[],"categories":[{"id":"premium-cartoon-porn-sites","collection":"categories_en"}],"screenshot_url":"https://cdn.staticstack.net/assets/img/r-thumbs/b4c9f12-3dxtube_small.png","image_alt":"3DXTube, Paid Cartoon Porn Site","scraped_at":"2025-10-28T21:17:00.247Z","iconSpritesheet":"default","logoIconClass":"icon88","pros":["hot 3d content","great graphics","lots of content"],"cons":["nothing yet!"],"detailedDescription":"<p>You will be amazed at what you will find here! 3D porn on your laptop!

Have you ever thought whether you can get some quality animations in the porn industry which aren’t just one-second loops of the same goddamn motion over and over again which you find in an SFM compilation on any fucking porn tube on the internet? I know I’ve been wondering this for a while now and the answer has shown itself to me in the form of Affect3DStore.com. I’ve gotta say, guys, I’m pretty much in love with this 3D format and it’s something new and fresh that I’m sure most people in here will appreciate a lot. If you feel that you’re the type of person that would really benefit a lot from this sort of content, then I think we should dive into Affect3DStore.com and see what it’s all about.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>How this place even came to exist in the first place</h3><p></p><p></p><p>So Affect3DStore.com was founded back in 2010 and it makes sense that a site this good would take almost a decade to develop. And even though it was made such a long time ago, it looks like a really modern site. We’ll talk more about the design later, but I first want to talk about the actual mission statements of this place. They have a whole list of items which explains exactly why they have content which is of such high quality on here. It was made by some of the best animators since they want to have the quality of the content reach the level which you see in the mainstream animations and movies in the real world.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>The mission statements of this premium 3D porn website</h3><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Modern and slick look, and it runs smooth as butter</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Affect3DStore.com also has a killer layout… but in a good way! They have all the right menus in the right place and all the links seem to take you to adequate places on the website. Affect3DStore.com doesn’t have any ads as far as I have seen, not even banner ads unless they are their own ads. That is to say that they advertise their own content when it gets released and so on which makes sense. I mean you came to the website to see that content, not something else, so I applaud them for that. But it also makes sense to mention that this is a premium site and all of the content costs money on here so if they had ads on here it would really be overkill. I mean there are some pieces of content here which are really expensive, to say the least.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>There are options for even the most frugal users</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Seven dollars? Damn, that’s not even enough for a decent Subway sandwich. I mean why would you even buy a Subway sandwich; those things are absolute garbage, to say the least. Anyway, $7 is still a killer price for some of the content that you can find on here. You’re going to love checking it all out. And to say that this is the end of it would be an understatement. I mean I haven’t even mentioned the content that you can find on here, so you should strap yourself in for this one cause it’s definitely not something that you want to miss out on. Check it out…</p><p></p><p></p><h3>The highest quality when it comes to 3D and 2D animations, comics, movies</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Well, you’ve got it all, from some regular sensual vanilla porn to some of the foulest monster porn and futa shit that you won’t find anywhere else. I mean you might find futa stuff in other places as well, but it would be safe to say that the futa porn on those other sites is garbage. We’re usually talking about only seconds of content that you go through and burn through in no time. Affect3DStore.com has actual content that lasts enough for you to cum and doesn’t stray away from the theme that it has started in, which is absolutely amazing.</p><p></p><p>Affect3DStore.com is an overall amazing site that I’d definitely recommend. The only bad part about it that I would mention is the fact that you have to pay for each piece of content individually. Other than that, I just can’t say anything bad about Affect3DStore.com. The only thing I can do is praise it. And in all honesty, that’s the only thing that this website deserves. It’s obvious that the people over there are passionate as hell about the project so I don’t want to make their fight any harder since they’re out here against all the shitty 3D content with this amazing stuff that you’ll find on here.

I think it really boils down to whether or not you’ve ever fallen down the hentai rabbit hole of the internet, since pretty girls with dicks usually go by a variety of different names outside of the niche. If you know what a futanari is, I guess we’re in the same exclusive club. Greetings, fellow pervert!</p><p></p><p>Just in case you’re new to the genre, I’ll spell it out in plainer words: <strong>Futa3DX.com is a premium site hawking high-quality 3D porn and comics starring gorgeous chicks with enormous dicks</strong>. They’ve been around for almost exactly a year at the time of this writing, and it looks like they’ve built up a more than respectable fanbase. Hundreds of thousands of cock-loving straight weebs are stopping by every month for a peek, and today your old pal MissAVDH is among them. Hopefully they don’t give me an inferiority complex over my human-sized big dong.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Well-Endowed Dick-Girls by the Bundle</h3><p></p><p></p><p>As soon as I pulled up the front page here, it was obvious I was looking at something else. Futa3DX.com has all the trappings of a premium joint, from the polished layout to the auto-playing montage at the top of the screen. More importantly, though, the quality of the content is noticeably much higher than you find on the free sites. It ain’t quite Pixar level, but everything is gorgeous, from the character models to the 3D sets to the explicit animations of fucking, sucking, and other adult activities.</p><p></p><p>3D futanari cartoons are arguably a pretty deep niche already, but <strong>I’m impressed by the range of freakiness going on at Futa3DX</strong>. The content here is produced by almost 20 different creators, each with their own different styles and sexual interests. I hadn’t even left the front page before I saw interracial futa tit wanks, group-sex footjobs, hardcore ass banging, and even some interspecies tomfoolery with a couple green-skinned goblin chicks going to town on a Laura Croft stand-in. Who needs to raid tombs when you can plunder wombs?</p><p></p><p>Side note: I’ve been doing my damnedest lately not to use terms like shemale or tranny when I’m reviewing trans porn content, even though a lot of fans are still typing those words into search engines, and they’re how a lot of sites are still billing their material. Futanari, on the other hand, doesn’t seem to have the same negative connotations; your angry uncle ain’t ranting about futas or dick-girls over Christmas dinner. I hope this remains the case, but culture can be a weird, unpredictable thing. Let’s all keep our fingers crossed and our dicks hard.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Futa Freebies and Tickets for the Full Show</h3><p></p><p></p><p>If you need something a little more substantial, it’s just a click away. Standard memberships at Futa3DX.com cost the same thirty bucks as most live-action adult paysites, including my own MissAVDHCasting. That’s the all-inclusive plan with streaming and downloading, but you can score a pretty killer deal if you don’t plan on saving anything. <strong>Streaming-only memberships are cheap as fuck at just ten bones a month</strong>. The yearly rate is even cheaper and adds the downloads back in.</p><p></p><p>As I was lingering on the signup page to scope out the prices, I got an even better offer from the Futa 3DX chat bot. You can get up to 50% off the regular rates from the automated system, so I recommend taking your sweet-ass time while you’re deciding which plan to spring for. It could save you a pretty penny.</p><p></p><p>Be careful when you’re signing up, because they tried to automatically opt me into a recurring membership for another paysite. This is a major pet peeve of mine so I’m always on the lookout, but the fine print and the checkbox are small enough to go unnoticed until you look at your credit card bill. Goddamn, I hate that shit!</p><p></p><p>By the numbers, I’d still say the membership is worth it even at regular price. The current Futa3DX stash contains 58 3D videos and 58 comics. The digits are so even I was worried they were repurposing content, but it looks like it’s just a coincidence; the animations and comics offer different futanari storylines and characters getting their freak on.</p><p></p><p>Updates are a little bit sporadic, though you typically get at least a couple fresh pieces of Futa 3DX porn every week. They’ve been dropping a new comic every seven days lately, but the vid releases seem a little more random. Sometimes you’ll get two fresh movies on successive days, other times you might wait a couple weeks. Over the course of a month, though, it should even out. The bang per buck ratio is solid.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Donating Sperm with Futa 3DX</h3><p></p><p></p><p>The video opens with some upbeat music as the opening credits slide by, and then we’re transported to the waiting room of a really fancy looking doctor’s office. “Miss? Are you ready for your appointment?” the big-titted nurse asks. It quickly becomes clear our heroine is there to make a deposit of sperm, but she insists the little vial ain’t going to be big enough. Once she whips out her giant dick, the audience knows she was probably right.</p><p></p><p>Those free futa scenes I mentioned are usually just a few moments of fucking without any setup, so I appreciate how this movie has the full porno treatment. The voice acting and sound effects are solid; when the nurse is stroking that huge cock, we hear sexy little moans and the squishy sound of a well-lubed dong being jerked. “I may need more than just a helping hand,” says the blonde chick, at which point the nurse starts using her mouth.</p><p></p><p>If sperm banks were really this much fun, I’d be donating my spunk a lot more often. The local place doesn’t even have magazines or videos anymore, expecting visitors to just whack off to their phones. Fortunately, you can always pull up a site like Futa 3DX, which will help you bust a big, fertile nut into the sample container.</p><p></p><p>Futa3DX.com is one of the better options out there for dick-girl fans looking for premium 3D hentai. The production values are on par with what you expect for a paysite, with a fat library, updates all month long, and a nice range of high-quality futanari content. This one’s got plenty of free previews available, so I recommend taking a peek and seeing how your boner feels after a few minutes. I think you’ll know exactly whether or not it’s worth the entry fee.</p>"}},{"id":"2082f40b9e65","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"2082f40b9e65","title":"Futa Sentai Squad","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"FutaSentaiSquad.com is a science fiction Futanari action 3D animation series including full Adult Time access and thousands of XXX trans porn movies, etc.","canonical":"https://theporndude.com/zh/12446/futasentaisquad","affiliate_url":"https://www.futasentaisquad.com/?utm_source=250584&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=","rating":4,"siteOrder":8,"price":"free","tags":[],"features":[],"categories":[{"id":"premium-cartoon-porn-sites","collection":"categories_en"}],"screenshot_url":"https://cdn.staticstack.net/assets/img/r-thumbs/6535e92-futasentaisquad_small.png","image_alt":"Futa Sentai Squad, Paid Cartoon Porn Site","scraped_at":"2025-10-28T21:17:17.337Z","iconSpritesheet":"custom-favicon-spritesheet.png","iconPosition":"-144px -608px","iconClassName":"ctm-icon12446","logoIconClass":"icon12446","pros":["premium 3d futanari hentai series","comes as part of the adult time network (55k+ vids, 8+ updates per day)","cheaper membership than most paysites"],"cons":["downloads not included with regular membership","only 4 futa sentai squad episodes","rare updates to the futa sentai squad series"],"detailedDescription":"<p>I hate to say it, but Futa Sentai Squad has somewhat of a redundant title. It reminds me of when people say ATM machine, even though the M already stands for Machine. It’s especially ironic here, because the site’s target demographic is exactly the kind of weeaboos and otaku neckbeards who’d start a bloodthirsty internet argument over trivial anime distinctions. “Well, actually,” they’d begin, adjusting their fedoras, and then tell you how sentai and squad mean the same thing.</p><p></p><p>Maybe I’m guilty of exactly the thing I just described, but hey, it’s only because I’m one of you. That’s why I was eager to check out FutaSentaiSquad.com, <strong>a 3D animated futanari series from Adult Time</strong>. Freaky homemade shemale cartoons are becoming ever more common on the free hentai tubes, but they’re typically like ten seconds long and amateur as fuck. Let’s see how much of a difference a few bucks a month makes in the quality of this growing niche, shall we?</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Saving the Day with the Futa Sentai Squad</h3><p></p><p></p><p>That imagery is exactly why you’re here. This ain’t your typical porno, nor is it your typical adult cartoon collection. As the name implies, girls with big dicks are the primary focus here. Both the still and moving previews show a freaky array of transexual depravity, including penile swordfights, self-fellatio while being anally penetrated, and one well-endowed babe strapped into a machine to have her tatas and dingdong milked.</p><p></p><p>I’ve reviewed a couple of Adult Time’s cartoon imprints recently, and I like how each one has its own style and theme. HentaiSexSchool is exactly what it sounds like, and yeah, the school has some futanaris in attendance and on the faculty. There’s also AgentRedGirl, an AdultTime studio that puts out hermaphroditic animations with a cutesy, big-headed animation style.</p><p></p><p>With FutaSentaiSquad.com, they’ve dropped those dick girls into a futuristic science-fiction setting. The vibe’s going to appeal strongly to futa fans who also love action anime with fighting robots and Blade Runner dystopias. The animation is brightly colored, jiggly in the fleshy bits, and overall looks a lot better than the homebrew ‘toons on the tubes.</p><p></p><p>I think Adult Time has grown popular enough that they’re counting on the brand recognition to sell tickets, because there ain’t much in the way of free previews. Aside from the silent montage out front, there’s just nothing to look at without paying your way inside. There’s a limited preview available for a few bucks if you just want a quick peek, or you can just pony up the cash for a full Adult Time membership.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>How About Some More Porn with Your Porn?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>The standard monthly rate is twenty bucks a month, which is about ten bones cheaper than most paysites, even my own MissAVDHCasting. Try clicking away from the signup page and coming back a few times. I did that and ended up getting a discount code for an even better deal.</p><p></p><p>One downside to Adult Time is that downloads ain’t included with the basic “Full Access” plan. I think the low price and massive size of the stash make up for this, but downloads are available if you’re willing to pay for them. The yearly plan includes downloads and breaks down to about twelve bucks a month, which is cheaper in the long run anyway.</p><p></p><p>Another small downside is with respect to the Futa Sentai Squad series itself. FutaSentaiSquad.com gets its own domain to increase brand recognition and earn some signups from the futanari enthusiasts out there, but there are currently only 4 episodes of the series available. New eps are rare as fuck, too; they dropped a couple videos in 2021, and have released just two more in 2024.</p><p></p><p>I already mentioned some of the other Adult Time futanari cartoons that are included with your membership, which will help soften the blow. There’s also a ton of live-action trans porno included, literally thousands of videos, which means most fans of the subgenre won’t be left with aching blue balls.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Getting to Know the Futa Sentai Squad</h3><p></p><p></p><p>At just 8 minutes, it’s the shortest episode yet, but not by much. Episode one was the longest at ten minutes, which isn’t great compared to traditional porno. Compared to the DIY futa scenes you find on the free hentai tubes, though, it feels like a full-length epic. The full series only adds up to about 36 minutes so far, but that might be longer than all the short futa clips on the average hentai tube.</p><p></p><p>The video opens with a few logos before a lady with big tits and a donkey dick appears on the screen. She’s having an angry conversation with another similarly endowed babe, long dong hanging between her knees. The dialog and voice acting sounds straight out of Saturday morning anime, professional and heroic as fuck. “I will never stop fighting,” says the redhaired dick girl as she walks away. “Not when there are lives on the line!”</p><p></p><p>Cut to the same babe piloting a big-dicked mecha in a fight with another giant robot futanari. The redhead’s mech gets its dicked grabbed and forcibly stroked. “Oh no! If she keeps that up, all the serum will eject early!” Turns out that “milking” thumbnail I saw out front was actually the pilot’s interface for the machinery. I’m currently in talks with an engineer about building something similar to help me work on my laptop.</p><p></p><p>It's a surprisingly sexy scene for something that tries so hard to roll the mecha tropes in with the futanari stuff. The building-sized bots end up having a hot and heavy threesome while their pilots get sucked and sucked by the tubes hooked up to their various sexual protuberances.</p><p></p><p>The video ends with a cliffhanger, suggesting more in store, and then some end credits with stereotypically cheesy anime music. It doesn’t feel like they’re just pandering to their audiences. No, I think FutaSentaiSquad is created by genuine anime nerds and shemale-loving perverts, which ultimately makes for a strong product.</p><p></p><p>FutaSentaiSquad.com on its own is a little too light on content to be worth twenty bucks for most subscribers. Then again, it’s technically fetish content, so it does command a higher dollar. This ain’t a singular website, though, as Adult Time really rounds out the package with an absolutely ginormous collection of smut in damn near every genre. That includes a fair number of trans porno cartoons, and an even bigger collection of live-action movies.</p><p></p><p>I’d say AdultTime.com is going to be worth the entry fee for most masturbators interested in seeing a little bit of everything. The inclusion of FutaSentaSquad sweetens the deal for futanari enthusiasts, as the animations are much longer and of much higher quality than the homemade stuff on the usual hentai tubes. There are no downloads included with the basic plan, but you’ll probably be too busy jacking off to even notice.</p>"}},{"id":"56b0ac81593c","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"56b0ac81593c","title":"EroBits","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"EroBits.com is a platform standalone 3D porn comic artist who can peddler his works hundreds of comics.

Let’s see what everyone’s getting all hot and bothered about, shall we?</p><p></p><p></p><h3>EroBits is Full of Naughty Bits</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Typically, if I see CG futanaris and 3D monster sex, it’s on one of the free adult comic sites. Once I saw the price tags, I knew this wasn’t your typical library of whatever the hell they could scrape from the web. As much as I love those free sites, you don’t get much Original Content or exclusive material. Here, you can buy your comics right from artists themselves.</p><p></p><p>I’m sure there are some cheapskates in the audience right now thinking, “Well, I’ll just save a few bucks and shake my dick at one of the free sites.” You’re free to do that, and hell, I don’t even blame you. Groceries cost like twice what they did last year, making everyone’s porn budget a little skimpier. I do want to mention, though, that this is a great way to support independent porn comic artists. These guys tend to do this in their free time, and a few bucks can go a long way in ensuring more great content in the future.</p><p></p><p>EroBits.com currently has about a dozen artists creating, posting and selling their material on the site. Given the way their traffic has been blowing up lately, I imagine that number is going to grow rapidly. The domain here was registered way back in 2015, but the current iteration of the platform is a much newer thing. Give it time and I think we’ll see even more amazing, elaborately kinky things.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>How Big of a Freak Are You?</h3><p></p><p></p><p><strong>EroBits.com has a kinky, freaky and unusual variety of perversion on offer</strong>. This is one of very few sites where the kinksters have more to choose from than folks who like regular ol’ sucking and fucking. They have the catalog broken into a handful of broad categories: BDSM, Fantasy, Futanari, Hardcore, Monsters, Parody and Sci-Fi.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Their Parody aisle is well worth a look for anybody who wants to see their favorite characters in scandalous situations. <strong>They’ve got parodies of a nice range of movies, comics and video games</strong>. Game of Thrones, Avatar, X-Men, Tomb Raider and Mortal Kombat are just a few of the properties that have gotten the X-rated treatment around here. I know Snow White is technically a public-domain fairy-tale character, but that’s the dress she’s wearing in the Disney version.</p><p></p><p>If I have just one complaint about the setup, I wish they included more in the way of traditional tagging. They have a handful of browsable subcategories like Femdom, Futa on Futa, and Monster Girls, but they rarely seem to get into the usual spread of porno niches like Lesbian, Blowjobs, Anal or Feet. The EroBits search function is hit or miss depending on what tags have actually been included. In a lot of cases, the search results come from sifting through descriptions, not tags.</p><p></p><p>On the same note, I wish they had a full, browsable tags index. Given the style of content and all the deep-niche fetishism on offer, I think EroBits.com would benefit from the kind of sprawling tags index you find on a hentai site. The catalog is still relatively small and easy enough to browse manually, but a better tagging system would help a lot as the library continues to grow.</p><p></p><p>Take a recently featured EroBits comic called Elven Fun, for example. It’s got exactly four tags: Fantasy, Monsters, Lesbian and Threesome. Just from looking at the sample pics and reading the description, I would have also tagged it with Blowjobs, Futa on Female, and Anal. When proper tagging goes underlooked, it’s the end masturbator who suffers because they can’t find what they’re looking for.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>But How Do I Even Choose?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>The good news is that, even at this early stage, you’ve got your pick of hundreds of 3D porn comics. Currently, the Monsters aisle is the most jam-packed, with around a hundred sordid tales of beasts and their human lovers. By contrast, the Hardcore section is one of the smallest, with 40 comics currently on the menu. I told you kinksters were in the majority here!</p><p></p><p>The big question is where to dive in. Obviously, you’ll make your way to your favorite section full of your preferred masturbatory content, but that still leaves most of you with a shitload of options. If you’re cost-oriented, it’s worth mentioning that EroBits comics start at just a few bucks. I saw a ton of them going for just under three bones, with pricier stories running closer to a tenner.</p><p></p><p>I do wish they had a few more search filters, because that would help make your smut-buying decisions easier. A price filter would be nice, as would a method of searching by length. I don’t mind paying more if I’m getting a big bang for my buck, which may be the case with some of the longer 3D porn comics in the catalog. As the site continues to grow, a language filter might be useful in cultivating a more global audience. You can view the site in a huge number of languages, similar to MissAVDH, but all the current comics seem to be in English.</p><p></p><p>The search options may be a little bit lacking, but at least they offer up a fair amount of free samples. I clicked through to check the listing for a three-dollar comic called Dominate: Houseguest. It’s a 54-page BDSM tale of femdom and voyeurism with a MILF as the star. The quartet of sample pics show that MILF handcuffing a dude, sitting on his face and more. “I am putting those around your wrists so that you could not move and disobey me.” Kinky!</p><p></p><p>EroBits.com has some minor issues with the organization of their catalog, but the catalog itself is fucking stellar. They carry 3D comics in some truly rare porn niches, from a growing stable of talented artists who bring all kinds of depravity to the table. If you love this stuff and you want to support the artists who make it, EroBits is one of the best places to get your fix.</p>"}},{"id":"a72b62df093b","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"a72b62df093b","title":"ToonPass","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"ToonPass.com Adult Anime Confirm Animation Confirm Comics Confirm Advanced Content Of course Confirm As long as it is a website that talks about adult anime content and all related content Toon Pass is the diamond on my crown you will understand","canonical":"https://theporndude.com/zh/759/toonpass","affiliate_url":"http://toonpass.com/t?c=eyJhIjoyMiwibyI6ODQsInAiOjMsInB0IjoiQ1BBIn0g","rating":4,"siteOrder":10,"price":"free","tags":[],"features":["动漫"],"categories":[{"id":"premium-cartoon-porn-sites","collection":"categories_en"}],"screenshot_url":"https://cdn.staticstack.net/assets/img/r-thumbs/a02e129-toonpass_small.png","image_alt":"ToonPass, Paid Cartoon Porn Site","scraped_at":"2025-10-28T21:17:27.890Z","iconSpritesheet":"favicon-spritesheet.png","iconPosition":"-464px -304px","iconClassName":"icon759","logoIconClass":"icon759","pros":["hot toons, sfm, futa, and uncensored hentai","downloadable videos","great mobile site"],"cons":["small catalog of content"],"detailedDescription":"<p>Toon Pass! I want to see some hentai sluts getting fucked in every way imaginable. Yeah, there are plenty of sites with hot hentai babes getting what they deserve, but I want even more than just that. I like all kinds of animated porn. Comics, cartoons, hentai, and sometimes I’ll even jerk off to some quality 3D SFM shit if I’m feeling it. But I don’t want to have to go to half a dozen fucking sites to get my fix. I want one site where I can go and fap to all kinds of drawn porn. Fuck having to pay for all of those different memberships. I’m not about that life. So, I scoured the web in search of such a site, and I just might have found what I have been searching for.</p><p></p><p>ToonPass.com is a site that claims to house multiple different sites all in one place for one price. You get futa bitches, hentai, and cartoon porn all in one site. I will say that it’s aggravating that you can’t sample any of their videos before you sign up. At least throw in a free section. I’m not the biggest fan of paying for something without knowing what I’m getting. That’s how you end up on a blind date with some “babe” only to take her home and find that she’s sporting a wine bottle sized cock. No thank you.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Only $1 For a 1 Day Trial Membership</h3><p></p><p></p><p>The “free” sign up section of the site has a killer dark theme and lots of hot previews… but somehow the members' area looks worse. It’s got a bright white theme and has the setup of an older flash games site. Not the nicest to look at. And come the fuck on. You have a dark theme on the teaser page. You need to at least include a toggle option to turn that shit on in the members' area. Ridiculous, really.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Annoying Ads and Links to Other Sites</h3><p></p><p></p><p>And there are ad banners here and there as well. It really grinds my gears when premium sites make you look at ads. Isn’t that the kind of shit I’m paying not to see? It’d be like buying a private show at a strip club only to have the cheap bitches walk in and out of the room while the dimepiece blond is grinding on my lap.</p><p></p><p>Further down that menu, you can sort the content by the “sites” that they have here. They aren’t really separate sites so much as genres. You can sort by “CrazyToonSex” which gives you cartoon porn and parodies, “FutanariSluts” which is full of videos with hung dick girls, and “HentaiTemple” which gives you quality hentai videos. From there you can further filter everything out by your standard options like “Top Rated, Most Viewed, and Longest.”</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Small, Unorganized Catalog Left Me Wanting for More</h3><p></p><p></p><p>With a smaller catalog, I would expect a solid naming/organization system and full-length hentai movies. But you don’t really get that either. The names are vague like “Babe creampied by a beast” or “Gangbang in the warehouse.” You’ll get some videos that are 15-40 minutes long, but most fall right around the 5-10 minute range. It feels like a bait and switch compared to that free teaser page that makes the site look jam-packed full of hot hentai movies.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Download as Many Hot Videos as You Want!</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Click on any of the previews to get taken over to the video player, which doesn’t hold up as well as the previews do. You can’t toggle quality, and most of these videos are on the lower side of things. I may have seen one or two that might be 720p. Though you can download any of these kinky videos straight to your computer without any extra payments or bullshit like that. Then you can rate it, add it to favorites, comment, or whatever else you want while you jerk your microdick to these hentai babes.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Solid Mobile Experience</h3><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>MissAVDH’s Favorite Features</h3><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>MissAVDH’s Suggestions</h3><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>MissAVDH’s Final Thoughts</h3><p></p>"}}]

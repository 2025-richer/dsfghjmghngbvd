Game and media developers have been teasing us with the idea of completely immersive, realistic virtual reality technology since the late ‘80s. Back then, though, the technology seemed so farfetched, maybe something out of a sci-fi movie. When I was a kid, I couldn’t wait for virtual reality to become a reality. To actually commit my favorite characters’ fatalities on Mortal Kombat would have been a dream come true.</p><p></p><p>I had no idea then how my interest in virtual reality would evolve into what it has become today—allowing me to basically fuck my favorite porn stars on command. Shit, technology is awesome. Whether you’re using an Oculus Rift, HTC Vive, Samsung Gear VR, or Google Cardboard, now you can instantly become a part of porn instead of just idly sitting back and watching it, fapping at a distance. Porn has come such a long way since the days of stealing your dad’s latest issues of Playboy and hiding them under your mattress.</p><p></p><p>The internet houses tons of virtual reality porn for you to choose from. Naughty America makes big-budget VR videos, then there’s VirtualRealPorn, BadoinkVR, and Cam4 just to name a few. Almost all virtual reality porn is, appropriately, shot in that famous POV style we all know and love, only adding to the immersion of the experience. There are videos with 180 degrees of viewing, and others (less commonly) that allow for 360 degrees of fun.</p><p></p><p>With more and more VR porn being made, it was only a matter of time, of course, before we started to see entire porn tube sites dedicated to it. The aptly titled site, Vrporn.com is just one of them. Well, maybe it isn’t fair to say that they are “just one of them,” since they advertise themselves as “The #1 VR porn site in the world!” I’m not sure what metrics they are using, but it would take a good amount of digging around traffic rankings to contest it. So, let’s just take a look at the vrporn.com and see for ourselves, shall we?</p><p></p><p></p><h3>A Personable Porn Experience</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Kind of a weird flex at the end there, but okay. Still nice for them to offer up a bit of their history and this really shows that they are passionate about what they do. And, fortunately, this passion does seem to translate into how much care and thought they have taken in designing, developing, and maintaining their site.</p><p></p><p>Vrporn.com has a nice, no bullshit site design. A simple black background, white and blue text combo gives it that classic tube site feel. They also don’t feel the need to clutter the page with all a bunch of unnecessary shit like other similar sites—no obnoxiously large banners or confusing and jam-packed menu bars or tag lists to be found here. Just a slender bar at the top of the page with their logo in the corner, a search bar, and a navigation menu that you can toggle open or closed on the left.</p><p></p><p>Speaking of the navigation menu, it is actually a really helpful one. Another refreshing change of pace from a lot of other tube style sites I’ve seen. Easily jump around the site to categories, blog, videos, games, studios, porn stars, for women, gay, or trans. I should also note that, again unlike other sites, clicking on “games” does not bring you to some third-party site—Vrporn actually has a section for games on their site.</p><p></p><p>They don’t, unfortunately, have any games to play, just screen recordings of VR sex gameplay. I suppose this isn’t the biggest letdown in the world, though. It’s always good to be able to actually see gameplay before buying or downloading a game you have been eyeing. It would have just been a really nice touch if they also offered even some really basic VR games to fuck around with while you’re there.</p><p></p><p>The navigation menu also has a “How to watch VR” button, which brings you to an extremely helpful page that has an in-depth how-to of virtual reality. Not only does Vrporn offer step-by-step instructions for installation and site compatibility for all major VR devices (Android, iPhone, Oculus Go, Daydream, Samsung Gear VR, Oculus Rift, HTC Vive, Playstation, and Windows Mixed Reality), but they also have a section to help guide the VR novice in navigating the market and finding the right headset for his needs. As a VR beginner myself, I found this part of the site to be extremely helpful.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Strong Social Media and Blog Presence</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Not only is this great from a practical standpoint (now I know as soon as there is new VR porn to check out), but it also just adds to that level of personability that I mentioned earlier. Porn sites do not need to be cold, impersonal things to merely jerk off to. Vrporn.com perfectly demonstrates that porn sites can be professional too, providing their users with positive experiences that go beyond the bare minimum.</p><p></p><p>Then again, I suppose it should come as no surprise that a virtual reality porn site would know how to prioritize user experience, that is, after all, what VR is all about: experience. Nonetheless, it is too rare of a commodity in the world of online pornography, so I have to go out of my way to applaud it when I see it. Good on ya, Vrporn.com. Now if only other porn site builders would take a note or two …</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Premium Membership</h3><p></p><p></p><p>The last thing I want to praise about Vrporn (then I’ll stop sucking their dick for a minute, I promise) is that the site is entirely ad-free. Do I even need to mention why this is so impressive? Come on, all you do is watch porn and jerk off in your mom’s basement, I’m sure you know better than anyone that almost every fucking porn site on the web is riddled in ads. Even some paysites.</p><p></p><p>So, for a tube site that is half free to have no ads whatsoever? I am very impressed. Again, this must go back to the idea of making the experience the main concern. The people of vrporn.com have an obviously deep respect and appreciation for virtual reality—it can be disorienting enough to occupy to spaces at the same time (wherever you’re doing the virtual fucking and, presumably, your computer chair); the good people at vrporn.com understand this and don’t want to make the transition even more difficult by trying to sell you shit on top of it. Yet another reason to applaud this site.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Only One Shortcumming</h3><p></p><p></p><p>All in all, vrporn.com (often misspelled as \"porn VR\") is an incredible site that puts user experience above everything else. They have cultivated a real sense of personability and professionalism in their frequent blog and social media posts. And they have tons of insanely high-quality VR experiences to choose from. You’re gonna probably want to get a premium membership to really enjoy the site. But, even if you don’t, it can still function as a really fucking good introduction to the world of virtual reality porn.</p>"}},{"id":"6fae0dcb1a0d","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"6fae0dcb1a0d","title":"POVR","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"POVR.com is a free value-added porn site that shares thousands of free virtual reality porn videos while paid members can get more content from 11 different virtual reality paid porn sites.","canonical":"https://theporndude.com/zh/5620/povr","affiliate_url":"https://povr.com/?ncode=568d3a59f949f91.31388611&ocode=GC1984.1955589.700.1026.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0","rating":5,"siteOrder":5,"price":"premium","tags":["免费","付费","VR"],"features":[],"categories":[{"id":"best-vr-porn-sites","collection":"categories_en"}],"screenshot_url":"https://cdn.staticstack.net/assets/img/r-thumbs/a10d165-povr_small.png","image_alt":"POVR, virtual reality porn site","scraped_at":"2025-10-28T21:09:09.760Z","iconSpritesheet":"default","logoIconClass":"icon487","pros":["8,671 free vr porn videos","2000+ premium vr movies","content from 11 vr paysites","multiple updates per week","top pornstars","supports all major vr devices"],"cons":["still looks much better if you download"],"detailedDescription":"<p>POVR porn! I have to wonder what the smut peddlers at POVR.com paid for the name. Four-letter domains are valuable Internet real-estate, tough as fuck to get and even tougher if you want something that sounds relevant. The domain’s been registered since 2004, and until relatively recently, would have sounded like just another bullshit acronym that needs to be explained. In 2024, it’s obvious what those letters stand for, making it obvious what you’re going to find inside.</p><p></p><p><strong>POVR is a freemium virtual reality porn site with both free movies and a membership plan</strong>. It’s standard for any VR site to give out some freebies so you can test out their offerings before pulling the trigger on a full membership. These guys up the ante with an entirely different business model. A lot of you cheapskates are just going to beat off to the free stuff, having blown your stimulus check on the VR goggles months ago. Why buy the farm when the cow is giving out 180-degree blowjob movies for free? Let’s take a look around and find out.</p><p></p><h3>Thousands of Free VR Pornos, For Real?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Pull up the front page and you’ll see some of today’s <strong>top pornstars getting fucked in VR from the top studios</strong>. They’ve got Gabriela Lopez doing a Burlesque show for VRBangers and Selena Love riding virtual dick in a WankzVR porno. Dana DeArmond, Cherie DeVille and Charlotte Sinns are all getting freaky out front. They’ve even got that freaky 3D BDSM shit from KinkVR.</p><p></p><p>And you know what’s really fucking wild? The scenes I mentioned are among the <strong>8,671 free VR porn videos currently on the POVR.com menu</strong>. They’re adding them constantly, so the number is bound to be much higher by the time you get your sex helmet strapped on and your artificial butthole all greased up.</p><p></p><p>I noticed Paris White in a 6k VR porn parody from VRBangers called Legally Blonde, getting me all hard before I even managed to click anything. I made my way to the download page, where I was presented with files for any major VR device. They’ve got everything from the high-end Oculus gadgets to low-res files that will work on your smartphone headgear. I railed a Viagra up my nose while I was waiting for the download, then busted out the VR goggles.</p><p></p><p>It’s a damn fine clip, but it’s far shorter than the 47 minutes I was promised out front. I can’t say I’m all that surprised. Those thousands of freebies on POVR are mostly sample clips. They’re great for getting you all primed and ready to pop, but if you want a longer VR fap, you’re going to have to pony up some cash.</p><p></p><h3>How Much Does POVR.com Really Cost?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Do you know why else it’s a good time for VR porn? It’s still fucking cheap, because the porn studios are trying to get you hooked. Most paysites cost $30 a month, with a lot of specialty sites even charging more. A standard membership at POVR.com is just twenty bones a month, including full access to everything.</p><p></p><p>And goddamn, I mean everything! <strong>POVR rolls eleven premium VR sites into one</strong>, sweetening that sweet deal even more. Besides the ones I’ve already mentioned, their library includes immersive 3D content from Reality Lovers, Sexy VR, MILF VR, VR Latina, VR Conk, Lethal Hardcore VR, Her VR, Virtual Lovers and even Tranz VR in case you like chicks with dicks.</p><p></p><p>It’s worth noting that they’ve also got free samples for other sites not on this list. Just browsing the library, I found content from sites like Czech VR, Mature Reality, and VirtualXporn. I’m not sure if they’re planning on showing full videos from these sites, but I sure hope so.</p><p></p><p>I’m a sucker for a good deal, especially when it includes girls sucking cock in mind-boggling, ball-draining virtual reality, so naturally, I signed up. The very first thing I did was look at the release dates to see how often POVR is updating their collection. It turns out, it’s a whole fucking lot. <strong>They typically add more than a half-dozen VR movies a week</strong>.</p><p></p><h3>Digging Through the VR Sex Mountain</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Basically, what I’m saying is you need to plan ahead when fapping to POVR. It’s even harder than picking something on Netflix because you have to guess what you’ll be in the mood for later. Will you be aching to bang a virtual MILF or have an 18+ 3D teen pornstar in your bed?</p><p></p><p>You can narrow down your pickings via the menu of studios in the sidebar, or hit the checkboxes for Premium, Transgender or Female POV. I wish they had more genres and filters in the sidebar, but for now, I recommend making use of the Categories dropdown in the top corner of POVR.</p><p></p><h3>Jacking Off in Immersive 3D</h3><p></p><p></p><p>I really fell down the rabbit hole on their Pornstars page, because they’ve got <strong>some of the hottest, most popular sluts in the business banging in 3D</strong>. Fuck, I’m going to run out of space on my VR sex box. They’ve got 18 Riley Reid movies and 15 with Alex Coal. Melissa Moore’s only in 5, but they more than make up for that with 25 Abella Danger movies.</p><p></p><p>I ended up watching a VRLatina movie first, a little feature called Banging Beautiful Belluci. It’s one of the newer flicks on POVR, uploaded literally yesterday, so the 41-minute film is in brilliant, hyper-realistic 5k. As soon as I hit Play, the beautiful Ginebra Bellucci started doing stretches in front of me wearing a tight pair of lyrca shorts and a loose-fitting top. I often skip the tease segments in 2D movies, but Ginebra gets me all excited, just stretching her legs at the end of the couch I’m laying on.</p><p></p><p>If you like seeing eye contact in POV movies, try not to cum immediately when you see it in POV VR. I can feel Ginebra staring into my soul with those stunning brown eyes as she slurps and moans in 3D sound. At the 9-minute mark, she takes her shorts off, straddles the viewer and starts diddling herself. I think I’m in love.</p><p></p><p>I review porn sites every day, and I’m rarely as impressed as I am with POVR. This is a seriously fucking killer value in virtual reality porno. If you’re looking for a way to fill up that expensive new headgear without going further into debt, this is easily one of the best deals going. You get top-shelf content from some of the biggest studios and VR paysites out there, starring some of the hottest talent in the industry, all at a price lower than your typical 2D porn membership. Welcome to the future, you fucking perverts!</p>"}},{"id":"c47e1fe02f21","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"c47e1fe02f21","title":"BadoinkVR","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"BaDoinkVR.com I'm sure we all understand virtual reality very well.

With the advent of virtual reality, it did not take long at all for the adult industry to get their hands in on the action. In fact, many people credit porn for causing the first real boom in the virtual reality market. This should not come as a huge surprise. Virtual reality seems like the logical next step for a porn industry that has, for years now, been inching closer and closer to creating a more immersive and personalized experience.</p><p></p><p>The porn of today is entirely different from the porn of yesteryear. Point of view and ‘choose your own adventure’ porn videos are worlds apart from the side views and narrative-heavy videos your dad got off to before you were born. The overall trend in adult entertainment has pushed the medium overwhelmingly toward films that situate the viewer at the center of the action. The goal of contemporary porn? To come as close to making the porn watcher forget he is watching porn as possible.</p><p></p><p>Born of a congruent leap in technological capabilities and a demand for user-centric porn scenes, virtual reality porn has swiftly taken over the industry. It is only a matter of time, I predict, that VR porn becomes the industry standard. This is likely still at least a decade or two off from being the case—VR devices will have to become far more widespread and affordable first—but at the rate the technology and the demand are increasing, we are not too far off from primarily enjoying our porn in the form of virtual sluts sucking us off in our very own living rooms. Eventually, maybe she’ll even be a hologram slut. Now, that shit would be fucking wild, wouldn’t it?</p><p></p><p>There are a handful of sites now that offer virtual reality versions of their videos, to varying acclaim. Naughty America, for example, was one of the first traditional studios to start switching over. Slowly, similar premium porn studios seem to be following suit. Smaller, though, is the list of porn sites who dedicate themselves entirely to virtual reality. And I think it’s safe to say that Badoinkvr.com is, almost single-handedly leading the charge into the future of pornography. No other VR studio comes close to touching the acclaim that BadoinkVR has garnered for itself in just a few short years.</p><p></p><p>Badoink was launched in 2006 as a site dedicated to premium pornography. They did this on a platform of proprietary technology that allowed users to stream Badoink content on any device, as well as wirelessly cast videos to their televisions. Badoink has always been technologically intrepid. It wasn’t until 2015 that the company decided to shift its focus entirely to virtual reality, releasing BadoinkVR.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Porn to the Future</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Badoink VR has a few coveted awards under its belt as well. They were the Free Speech Association’s Internet Company of the Year in 2016; also in 2016, they won XBiz’s award for Adult Site of the Year: Virtual Reality; and 2018’s VR Site of the Year at the Adult Video News (AVN) awards. It’s rare that you come across a porn site that breaks into mainstream recognition. But, then again, it’s also rare that you come across a porn site that revolutionizes an entire industry the way BadoinkVR has been.</p><p></p><p>Although BadoinkVR has amassed an entire network of virtual reality porn sites (18VR, VRCosplayX, Kinkvr, and BabeVR), today we’ll just be taking a look at the original, Badoinkvr.com. From the moment you sign in and get to the member’s area, you will immediately be able to discern that this is unlike any other porn site on the web.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Far from Your Average Pay Site Experience</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Once you’re all geared up and ready to go, return to the site and scroll through what now looks a lot more like the premium member’s areas you are likely more familiar with. You’ve got a clean white background supporting simple black text, and a few extra-large thumbnails to peruse in each section. Browse videos by latest releases, recommended for you, or BadoinkVR’s finest ladies. To the right, you will also find a preview of an upcoming scene to look forward to; at the bottom, they will recommend videos from other sites in the BadoinkVR network, as well as links to other similar paysites.</p><p></p><p>At the top of the home page, you will also find a sleek and understated menu bar to help you navigate. Click into “Videos,” “Girls,” “Cams,” or “VR Theater.” Videos are pretty straightforward—just the easiest way to browse all of BadoinkVR’s scenes (filter by category; sort by newest, top-rated, or most viewed). Clicking on “Girls” will bring you to an alphabetized roster of all the beautiful ladies who appear in BadoinkVR films. Click on one who catches your eye, and she has a huge page dedicated just to her. Here, you will find her stats, a surprisingly in-depth bio, links to her social media accounts, her videos/pictures, and some other girls that Badoink deems similar to her (seems to be based on body type, hair color, etc.).</p><p></p><p>I was, admittedly, a little disappointed when I clicked on cams and saw that BadoinkVR does not run their own cam site. I guess I got my hopes up thinking that they would have implemented their VR technology to create a completely immersive cam site as well—be in the same room as the cam girls. No such luck (not yet anyway … take notes, Badoink!). Instead, clicking on “Cams” will bring you to Camonster.com.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Enjoy an Endless Theater of VR Sluts</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Your surroundings will be darkened as you make your selection. Choose your video and sit back as your entire room turns into a porn set and one of Badoink’s insanely sexy girls is suddenly crawling over to your hard dick on all fours. This is the fucking future of porn right here. All that’s missing is the sex robot that the VR goggles would automatically render into your favorite porn star. We may have quite a ways to go before we get there, but, trust me, that day is coming!</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Even More to Love</h3><p></p><p></p><p>If the recommended sites were not as similar to BadoinkVR as they are (most were other VR paysites), chances are I would feel vastly different about this. But I don’t really mind being suggested other sites to check out. In fact, all it really does is expand my pornographic lexicon—so, thank you BadoinkVR for the suggestions!</p><p></p><p>All in all, I fucking love this site. Unparalleled innovation, extremely high-quality porn, some awesome additional features, a whole network of VR sites to choose from. I already ordered my “free VR goggles.” I can’t wait until they arrive so I can enjoy BadoinkVR to its fullest extent.</p>"}},{"id":"12f3ebb8e988","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"12f3ebb8e988","title":"VirtualRealPorn","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"VirtualRealPorn.com VirtualRealPorn is the hottest thing in the porn industry at present, and there is a reason why as long as it is well-made virtual reality porn, then there is no porn on the market that is more interactive and immersive than it...","canonical":"https://theporndude.com/zh/1743/virtualrealporn","affiliate_url":"https://virtualrealporn.com/promo/?nats=OTk5MTAwMDguNzkuOC4xMC4wLjAuMC4wLjA","rating":5,"siteOrder":7,"price":"free","tags":[],"features":[],"categories":[{"id":"best-vr-porn-sites","collection":"categories_en"}],"screenshot_url":"https://cdn.staticstack.net/assets/img/r-thumbs/d9156f4-virtualrealporn_small.png","image_alt":"VirtualRealPorn, virtual reality porn site","scraped_at":"2025-10-28T21:09:21.034Z","iconSpritesheet":"favicon-spritesheet.png","iconPosition":"-432px -640px","iconClassName":"icon1743","logoIconClass":"icon14","pros":["crystal clear 5k, 3d videos","amazing interactive features and capabilities","tons of vr videos","fully immersive, realistic experience"],"cons":["can be expensive with all the gadgetry required"],"detailedDescription":"<p>Ah, Virtual Real Porn!

By the time I finally walked outside the war would be over and all I would find is a post-apocalyptic hellscape of rubble and carnage and steel limbs. ‘Wow, this neighborhood really went to shit,’ I would think, ‘Oh well, gotta grab some more beer then get back to let Alexa suck me off some more!’</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, we still have a few years to wait until the singularity and mass-market robot blowjob machines. What a bummer. The good news, though, is that there are still some really awesome and more real than ever ways to simulate sex to get you through those dry spells. Or I guess what you would call just your regular life.</p><p></p><p>Not only can you access any kind of porn at the click of a button any time of day or night for absolutely free, but porn has gotten more realistic than ever before. Thanks to the advent of virtual reality and Bluetooth technology, anybody who can afford it can basically fuck their favorite porn stars from the comfort of their living rooms. Just throw on a VR headset, choose a video, and grab your Bluetooth compatible pocket pussy and you’re good to go!</p><p></p><p>With virtual reality porn at its peak (and improving all the time), there are a fair amount of virtual reality porn sites to choose from. And, hey, investing in a VR porn habit is no cheap decision, so obviously you want to make sure that you choose the best of the best when it comes time to try out all that newfangled fapping gear you dropped a thousand bucks or so on. As you are already well aware, not all porn sites are created equal; the same goes for VR porn. With that in mind, today we’ll be taking a look at the premium pay VR porn site, Virtual Real Porn.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Interactive VR Porn and Teledildonics</h3><p></p><p></p><p>For starters, in addition to plenty of normal 3D, 180-degree VR porn videos where all you do is throw on your headset, sit back, unzip, and enjoy, Virtual Real Porn also provides interactive VR videos, requiring you to make choices in your porn. Do you remember those choose your own adventure books from when you were a kid? Well, Virtual Real Porn’s interactive videos are kind of like that … the only difference is that you really can’t lose in these interactive videos. Do you want Sasha to suck your dick while Laura eats her pussy? Or do you want Sasha and Laura to both suck your dick at the same time?</p><p></p><p>The choice is yours, and no matter what you choose, you still get to have a virtual threesome with two smoking hot chicks. The interactive videos are also often shot in 360-degrees, which means that you might be tempted to stand up and look around a bit, take in the scenery while Sasha and Laura go to town on your cock. It is an extremely immersive experience. I don’t understand why more VR porn sites don’t embrace this.</p><p></p><p>Another awesome feature that Virtual Real Porn has embraced to make the experience even more realistic is what they refer to as Teledildonics (great name). Basically, what this means is that if you have one of the compatible interactive sex toys in their list, you can sync it up with Virtual Real Porn videos so that it moves in conjunction with the scene. So, basically, you’re Fleshlight or Lovense toy will emulate the movements of your favorite porn stars at the same exact time they move in the video.</p><p></p><p>If you purchase the Lovense Max, for instance (a Bluetooth enabled pocket pussy), the inside of it will contract to simulate the actresses’ pussy movements and it will vibrate when skin hits skin. All you have to do is fuck at the same pace and you’re fucking your favorite porn star. This is some next-level shit right here. I have never tried it, but if you’re rich or desperate enough, please have at it and let me know how it is.</p><p></p><p>Virtual Real Porn is compatible with the Lovense Max, Lovense Nora, Feel Connect, Kiiroo Onyx, and Kiiroo Pearl. Some of these are pocket pussies, some are dildoes. If you are using the dildo version, it will sync up with the dude’s thrusts and whatnot, obviously. I wonder how the fuck they make this happen? You know what, I don’t care, it’s awesome, I’ll just leave it at that.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>But Is the Porn Itself Good?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Well, I am here to tell you that it most certainly is. In fact, it’s better than decent. The girls are super fucking hot, they interact well with the VR cam (you’d be surprised; a lot of models kind of ignore it altogether), and the 3D video and binaural audio quality is awesome (the newer videos are recorded in 5K!). But what I find most compelling about Virtual Rea Porn’s content are the situations. This is another element that a lot of Virtual Real Porn’s competitors leave out: interesting, believable, and relatable scenarios to enter into via VR.</p><p></p><p>Virtual Real VR is sort of a hybrid porn site. It is, of course, a virtual reality porn site on one hand, but it is also a reality porn site on the other. The result is great and only adds to that complete immersion I was talking about earlier. You have some classic scenarios to enjoy, like the virgin who wants you to make her a slut or the pizza delivery turned casual romp. But there are also some really novel and contemporary situations to fall into as well: fuck your horny Airbnb guest or a sexy Youtuber who you’ve been following and finally get to meet.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>A Fuck Ton of VR Videos</h3><p></p><p></p><p>When it comes to premium pay porn sites, you always want to make sure they are walking the line between quality and quantity. Lots of sites give you a ton of videos, but half of them suck dick; lots of sites give you amazing videos, but you’re lucky to get one every few months. With how awesome these VR videos are and the amount of work and money that goes into them, it is very impressive that Virtual Real Porn is able to produce as many as they do.</p><p></p><p>All in all, if you have doled out a bunch of cash on VR equipment and Bluetooth sex toys, I think Virtual Real Porn will be a great site to use it on. Like I said earlier, they are one of the only sites out there that are truly exploiting all of the capabilities of VR porn. And they are doing it well.</p><p></p><p>Hundreds of amazing, high-quality, well done virtual reality pornos, a great site design, some incredible interactive features that you just won’t find anywhere else … just like interactive porn itself, you just can’t lose with Virtual Real Porn. There are plenty of decent VR porn sites out there, but none of them that I’ve seen seem nearly as committed to providing a fully immersive virtual sex experience. So, until we all have sex robots, enjoy!</p>"}},{"id":"aeaf02364b12","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"aeaf02364b12","title":"Naughty America VR","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"NaughtyAmericaVR.com can satisfy your desire for a slutty American girl and is 3D virtual reality while experiencing an AV actress in a first-person perspective while giving you blowjobs while looking at her eyes deeply and then like a world-class fierce...","canonical":"https://theporndude.com/zh/1705/naughtyamericavr","affiliate_url":"https://www.naughtyamericavr.com/?nats=GC1984.10036.8.293.45.0.0.0.0&apc=Q9p26fvax6.62ja6ca2oh","rating":5,"siteOrder":8,"price":"free","tags":["VR"],"features":[],"categories":[{"id":"best-vr-porn-sites","collection":"categories_en"}],"screenshot_url":"https://cdn.staticstack.net/assets/img/r-thumbs/369faa6-naughtyamericavr_small.png","image_alt":"Naughty America VR, VR Porn Site","scraped_at":"2025-10-28T21:09:27.265Z","iconSpritesheet":"custom-favicon-spritesheet.png","iconPosition":"-144px -160px","iconClassName":"ctm-icon1705","logoIconClass":"icon1705","pros":["super hot pornstars in vr","high production values - great smut!","huge selection of movies","regular updates","supports sex toy \"the handy\"!"],"cons":["weird vr quirks"],"detailedDescription":"<p>Porno has really driven technology over the years. Sex flicks are responsible for killing Betamax in favor of 3-hour porno VHS tapes, a move we saw repeated with DVD and Blu-Ray smut. Online payments were literally invented to sell the Pam and Tommy Lee tape, and today naked babes make up roughly 97% of the entire Internet. Here’s another prediction: sites like Naughty America VR are going to make futuristic sex-helmets a household item.</p><p></p><p>NaughtyAmericaVR.com has only been around since 2015, but that’s because virtual reality porn is new as hell and just taking off. These guys are pioneers when it comes to delivering titties straight to your eyeballs. Naughty America has actually been online since 2003, so they were doing things right long before Oculus was even a thing.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Tons of Virtual-Reality Porno Flicks</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Pornos are lined up all over the screen, presented as a bunch of DVD covers as if we’re a bunch of primitive cavemen without head-mounted sex machines. Whatever, though, the format works: I want to watch most of these right now. There are a lot of names, faces, breasts, and asses that I recognize, as well as some stunning up-and-cummers.</p><p></p><p>It’s an impressive virtual DVD shelf, full of teen girlfriends, Ebony threesomes, big-assed MILFs, and shocking violations of gym health and hygiene standards, but it’s only page one of more than 30. I don’t see a total number of Virtual Reality porno movies listed, but there is a huge cloud of category tags accompanied by numbers of related videos. NaughtyAmericaVR currently has 188 Big Tits movies, 294 Bubble Butt scenes, and 346 Blowjob films. I’m sure there’s overlap, but I like those figures.</p><p></p><p>The whole package was more than enough to lead me to the JOIN button. Naughty America already has a reputation as a solid online porn site (check out my review on MissAVDH), so I assumed they’d charge a few extra bucks for access to the VR version. Nope. They’re asking the industry-standard $30 a month to watch these sluts fuck in 3D POV.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Bang Your Favorite Pornstars In VR</h3><p></p><p></p><p>The flick opens with Valentina opening a package in front of you. You can look around, but you’re sort of a fly on the wall in this scene. Anyway, why would you want to look at anything but this beautiful pornstar as she gets out of her dress and into the lingerie from the box?</p><p></p><p>Out on the landing page, I noticed NaughtyAmericaVR mentioned binaural audio in their pitch. I thought it was bullshit marketing talk until I heard the paper in the box crinkling. Holy fuck, with a decent set of headphones it’s like being there. If you’re impressed by that, wait until the next scene when the fucking starts.</p><p></p><p>If you like eye contact in your blowjob videos, try not to cum the instant you first experience it in virtual reality. The 3D gives it an intimacy you just can’t get with a flat POV movie. A similar thing can be said about VR kisses. A kiss is a throwaway in a typical porno, but here it helps sell the GFE they’re shooting for in their VR pornstar girlfriend movies. It really feels like a beautiful woman leaning in to kiss you.</p><p></p><p>Valentina rides you after the blowjob, her perfect boobs bouncing up and down right in your face. I thought it worked a little better than the 69 action, though that’s going to be incredible when they figure out how to send the smell of pussy through the Internet.</p><p></p><p>It would be a top-shelf porn scene without the VR element. Valentina Nappi is an absolute beauty and fucks like a goddess. The fact that you can come this close to living it just elevates the entire production to another level.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Beat Off With A Computer On Your Face</h3><p></p><p></p><p>There are a few weird VR quirks related to perspective. Chicks are kind of blurry until they get into banging range, and sometimes when they stick their asshole in the camera it ends up looking enormous in your eye-screens. Crystal Rush got too close during a kiss and I experienced the stark terror of having my face chewed down to the sinuses by a Russian pornstar. Angle changes can be jarring, as suddenly the whole room will be tilted at a dangerous grade while women balance precariously on your dick.</p><p></p><p>That said, these are primarily issues with VR and not NaughtyAmericaVR. The technology is getting better all the time. Another issue NaughtyAmericaVR can’t help with is the fact that you really should download your movies. Unless you’re on an insanely fast business connection with the most expensive VR setup in the world, streaming quality is probably not going to compare. In a pinch, streaming on NaughtyAmericaVR is passable, and will only get better in the coming months and years.</p><p></p><p>Files are big, so schedule your VR wank sessions accordingly. While you’re waiting, line up your tissues and lotion, lube up your silicone vaginas and rubber mouths, and pop a Viagra or load your bong. Speaking of bong-loading, you owe it to yourself to experience how stoner slut Melissa Moore satisfies her munchies in VR. Spoiler: she eats your very own cock.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Pornstars Gyrate on Your Palm</h3><p></p><p></p><p>NaughtyAmericaVR is a winner if you’re looking to load up your new VR toy with pornography. The collection is already deep, full of top-shelf smut starring your favorite sluts, and the stash is growing all the time. It’s futuristic 3D porn, and it costs the same as any other premium site. This one’s a no-brainer, folks.</p>"}},{"id":"99bffe151c57","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"99bffe151c57","title":"VRBangers","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"VRBangers.com is one of the first virtual reality porn sites to appear and it is still one of the best to see why VR Bangers has been able to win awards from AVN and XBIZ updated twice a week by top AV actresses starring...","canonical":"https://theporndude.com/zh/1933/vrbangers","affiliate_url":"https://vrbangers.com/?link_data=eyJvZmZlcl9pZCI6IjEiLCJhZmZfaWQiOiIyMyIsImNhbXBhaWduX2lkIjoiIiwibGlua19pZCI6IjMxMjk3IiwiY2xpY2tfaWQiOiI5Y2VlMDhiMi0zYTY4LTQ3NTUtOGJjMi1mNDQzYTIxYmQzNWYiLCJjcmVhdGl2ZV9pZCI6IjczIiwidHlwZSI6ImxhbmRpbmcifQ%3D%3D","rating":5,"siteOrder":9,"price":"free","tags":["VR"],"features":[],"categories":[{"id":"best-vr-porn-sites","collection":"categories_en"}],"screenshot_url":"https://cdn.staticstack.net/assets/img/r-thumbs/6aca53b-vrbangers_small.png","image_alt":"VRBangers, VR porn site","scraped_at":"2025-10-28T21:09:32.916Z","iconSpritesheet":"favicon-spritesheet.png","iconPosition":"-416px -704px","iconClassName":"icon1933","logoIconClass":"icon59","pros":["good price for premium porn","top pornstars in multiple releases per week","4k and 6k 360 vr smut","positions menu","app available"],"cons":["sexy but vague thumbnails"],"detailedDescription":"<p>VR Bangers! The next generation of virtual reality is some pretty exciting shit, huh? Drop a few bills, slap on a helmet and you can fight monsters, fly spaceships, climb mountains, or go on educational adventures around the world. Of course, you see everyone swinging their controllers, blindfolded to reality, and you have a completely different thought: I wonder what it’s like to masturbate in that thing. VRBangers aims to give you just that opportunity.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Premium Porn Delivered Straight to Your Eyeballs</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Today’s virtual reality sex movies are the culmination of centuries of dreams and the hard work of men determined to bang women more attractive than their own wives, at least in their fantasies. We’ve come a long way since multi-angle DVD porn, silicone vaginas, and whatever they used to flog the donkey a century ago. I’m no historian, but I’m pretty sure it was a rock or a stick or something. Technology has given us so much, so fast.</p><p></p><p>Of course, there’s a steep learning curve. Those VR porn sites popping up right now, trying to get in on the next big thing, all have some catching up to do. A few years of experience have taught VRBangers enough to earn them the 2018 XBIZ Award for Best Virtual Reality Sex Scene and the 2019 AVN Award for Best Virtual Reality Scene.</p><p></p><p>Another major advantage of VRBangers getting in on the ground floor? They’ve worked with and continue to film fuck flicks with some of the top talents in the game. You don’t have to log in to check out their Pornstars page and see who’s on the menu. They’ve got top-shelf sluts like Valentina Nappi, Riley Reid, and Mia Malkova lining the screen.</p><p></p><p>The whole presentation is more than enticing enough to lead me to the Join page. Before I could even check out the prices, a photo of Abella Danger popped up with a special offer to get access for $0.50 USD per day. As you may be aware, Abella has one of the most scrumptious White girl booties in the industry right now. A peek is worth more than that, even in plain ol’ 2D like the savages beat off to.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Cheaper Than an Escort, and Cleaner</h3><p></p><p></p><p>It’s a damn good time to sign up for a premium VR site. You usually expect to pay more for the newest types of media, but the smut peddlers are eager to make you a longtime consumer. Even if you don’t get that deal I mentioned above, the standard membership rate for VRBangers is only 25 USD a month. That’s a few bucks less than porn sites that make you watch anal hardcore films on a flat-screen like a homeless person. I know that HTC Vive wasn’t a cheap investment, but this will help you make up the difference.</p><p></p><p>As with any decent paysite, you get a lower rate with a longer membership. If you really want to go all-in on the 3D humping, they offer a bundle that also includes their tranny site and access to a VR sex game called SinVR.</p><p></p><p>This ain’t no rinky-dink bullshit operation, so they’ve got formats compatible with all the major devices. Oculus, Gear VR, Windows MR, and PSVR are all good to go, and it’ll even work with Android and iOS gadgets if you’re old-school like that. They’ve got an app if you’re straddling that VR/phone line.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Banging Out the VR Bang Flicks</h3><p></p><p></p><p>I do wish the preview images on the main screen told you a little bit more about the flicks behind the thumbnails. I know that Airvrb stars Tiffany Watson, but I don’t know what she does in the movie besides suck on a dildo and show her pussy. Does she have a costar smashing her from behind or take a messy facial? There are no tags listed on the front page, so I have to click through to find out the scene includes Tiffany and her Natural Tits and Shaved Pussy riding Cowgirl and taking Big Dick down her Deep Throat.</p><p></p><p>There’s a baked-in player on VRBangers.com, but you’re going to want to download the movies. The 3D 180 6K format of this movie is nearly 7 gigs. I know this puts a little damper on your impromptu masturbation sessions, but you need to plan ahead for the optimal VR wank.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Pick A Scene and Stick Yourself In It</h3><p></p><p></p><p>VRBangers’s search features are built into the top of the main page. Enter your terms in the bar, or check off a few categories from the dropdown. How do you want this evening? Choose from all the porn classics like Anal, Asian, and Ebony, or go modern with Cosplay. I guess I should have expected a Hobbit porn parody on a site aimed at perverted tech geeks.</p><p></p><p>I checked off Teen and Brunettes and then chose Sitting from the Positions dropdown. Most VR sex sites don’t have that latter menu, but it’s pretty fucking smart. The whole genre has these weird camera angle jumps that take some getting used to. It’s jarring when you finally convince yourself you’re banging a porn star riding your cock while you’re on your back, and then you’re suddenly standing with a dick in her face. The Positions dropdown isn’t perfect, because porn scenes naturally will change angles, but it is a nice way to meet in the middle. I’m sitting, so I want to watch a sitting scene right now.</p><p></p><p>Wouldn’t you know it? Tutti Frutti with Casse Del Isla was uploaded just a few days ago. It’s an hour-long and nearly 13 gigs, so tell your boss you have really bad diarrhea. You’re going to be in the restroom all day, and you need that plastic space helmet for medical reasons.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Living the Porn Dream, At Least in VR</h3><p></p><p></p><p>I’m not really a patient dude, though, so I skipped ahead a few minutes to the blowjob. The actor’s dick is a downgrade for me, but it’ll make you nerds feel like a monster. You can almost feel Cassie’s very talented tongue as she works the shaft. A few minutes later and she’s already taking off her panties to get it from behind.</p><p></p><p>It’s hard to express my enthusiasm for VRBangers in words, but I know the other subway passengers knew exactly how much I enjoyed it. This is easily one of your best choices if you’re trying out virtual reality self-gratification for the first time, or if you just haven’t been impressed with some of the other sites out there. These guys are putting out some of the best content with the best talent in the business, and their collection size is nothing to scoff at.</p>"}},{"id":"b5c46cbe1a11","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"b5c46cbe1a11","title":"WankzVR","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"WankzVR.com is a paid virtual reality porn site.

Put down that shitty porn magazine or 480p video on your phone and listen the fuck up. Why are you still watching that same old boring shit? It’s time to try something new. Something that will ruin regular porn for you forever. VR porn. Before you even start. Don’t come at me with that bullshit that you can’t afford a VR headset. Not only does the site I’m talking about this time come with a free smartphone headset, but there are also tons of cheap options to start getting your freak on.</p><p></p><p>Hell, if you’re not looking to do gaming with it, then you don’t even need that fast of a computer. But if you’ve got money to fucking party, then throw on that HTC Vibe and kick back with your fully interactive VR porn experience where your fleshlight rides your dick in time with the video you lucky fuck.</p><p></p><p>The awesome site I have for you is called Wankzvr.com. It’s part of the bigger WANKZ network, but keep in mind that your subscription will only get you access to the VR site, unless you go and ball out with one of their package deals. But, still, the prices aren’t too bad. And, as I said, this shit comes with a free VR headset!</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Free VR Headset with a Premium Membership!</h3><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Sleek Site Design and Massive Previews Makes Navigation Simple</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Before we get into the options up top, man these previews are perfect. They aren’t animated, but I don’t how you would go about that with a VR site anyway. You get this huge box where you can see a promo preview shot from the video. You get the name of the pornstar and title of the video upfront. The newest one as I’m writing this is called “The New Guy” with Dakota Skye. Fuck, they know my weakness. She’s definitely up there in my top 5 pornstars. I mean, have you seen her. Goddamn.</p><p></p><p>Next to that big promo, you can select what kind of device you have and download the video in a multitude of different ways. All the way up to 1080p and 60fps. Hell yeah. And there’s more! You can view the rating, how long the video is, when it was uploaded, view all of the tags it has, read a short description of the video, and request help or provide feedback if you like the video or are having trouble with your headset.</p><p></p><p>Phew, that’s a fuck ton. And it’s not like other VR sites where there’s 10 videos or some shit. They have over 300 video experiences and they update that shit twice a week! Talk about leading by example. Two new VR videos per week destroys a lot of the competition’s efforts. While we’re on the topic, I’ll just get it out there that the videos themselves are amazing. They really are made for a VR experience. I just used my smartphone, but even that showed me that you can look around everywhere and take it all in.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Multiple Download and Streaming Options for Any VR Headset on the Market</h3><p></p><p></p><p>As much as I’d like to go even more about these videos, there is more amazing shit to talk about on this site. The “Pornstars” page is solid. Full HD preview pictures, image galleries of the model, short bio descriptions, a list of their video performances, and other non-VR videos that they have done within the WANKZ network. Awesome, next. The interactive tab is for you lucky rich bastards out there who can afford the best VR setup, along with a fleshlight and Kiiro sex dock that syncs the video with your fleshlight. That shit has to be like crack. Once you do it there’s no going back to regular sex.</p><p></p><p>The “Favorites” page is what you think it is. Add a playlist of VR videos here to check out later. The “Discussion” page is actually pretty cool. It’s like a forum. You can request that the site reaches out to certain pornstars for more content. I’d like to see Veruca James get in on this shit, but that’s just me. You can go and request any of your favorite sluts, and, who knows, you might just get your wish. It’s also a good place to talk about VR porn in general, or request scenes and such.</p><p></p><p>Then there’s a help tab where you can get support. You can even specify what sort of setup you have, and they will help you troubleshoot why a video isn’t playing, or you can read the FAQ and that’ll probably help you out. Lastly, they have a section for live cams. I think that they are VR supported. It’s on the VR site still, but I’d go ahead and give it a shot yourself. They worked fine on my smartphone.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Of Course, the Mobile Site is Great!</h3><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>MissAVDH’s Favorite Features</h3><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>MissAVDH’s Suggestions</h3><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>MissAVDH’s Final Thoughts</h3><p></p>"}},{"id":"c1d1faa9ebb2","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"c1d1faa9ebb2","title":"Virtual Taboo","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"VirtualTaboo.com has the largest archive of virtual reality pornographic content on the Internet.

Let’s find out.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Strap That Sex Box to Your Face</h3><p></p><p></p><p>The titles scrolling by, framing the scenes, makes the whole presentation even hotter: Party Time Inside Sister’s Pussy, Wedding Tips From Daddy, and Japanese Daughter Gets Warm Welcome all made the featured scenes at the top. Scrolling down the page, the other samples are no less sexy. A stepsister cleans a room and sucks a dick, a stepmom gets a special gift on Mother’s Day, and there’s some kind of sexy dessert incident at a stepfamily dinner.</p><p></p><p>Below each sample image is a button to sign up for the site, and another that says Download. I figured the Download button was a trick, another door leading to the sign-up page, but it’s legit. Click it and there are options to buy the full thing or get a sample in a variety of VR formats.</p><p></p><p>Most porn sites won’t let you download a damn thing without paying, but it makes a lot of sense for a VR site. They say they’re compatible with all the major VR devices right now, but potential members may be pissed to find out they can’t use VirtualTaboo with the Sony Ocultus VRbox-One they bought from some guy’s trunk at the flea market.</p><p></p><p>So, specifically, which gadgets work with the site? I clicked the Download icon underneath Daddy, What Are You Doing?! and found downloads catered to SmartPhones, GearVR, Playstation VR, and Oculus. As long as you’re not rocking some off-brand bullshit, you’ll be fine.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>I Wanna Be A VR Pornstar</h3><p></p><p></p><p>They don’t have the one-dollar trial you’ll find on other sites, but you can buy a single video for ten bucks. It’s a bad deal compared to the regular membership, but a VR blowjob from one of these girls is better than the kind of beej a tenner usually gets you behind the local 7-11. On the other end of the spectrum, a lifetime of unlimited access will run you a cool $250.</p><p></p><p>You can pay by credit, debit, or PayPal. It’s confidential billing, so your wife’s not going to look at your shared Visa bill and know you bought sex movies for your space helmet. She’ll figure that out from the cum stains all over your recliner, you filthy pig.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Banging Step-Sisters in Crisp, Clean 5K</h3><p></p><p></p><p>VirtualTaboo’s been at it for a while, though. They uploaded their first POV Asian student movie at the ass-end of 2015, and now their archive stretches back nearly 300 scenes. That’s not a massive number if you’re surfing for any old, garden-variety porn, but this is all VR. I’m impressed.</p><p></p><p>The early videos were crisp and sexy, offering blonde cuckolding and lesbian taboo scenes at up to 1440p. A lot of porn sites these days are still struggling to offer a decent selection of even 1080p flicks, and here’s VirtualTaboo offering higher. In 2018, they switched to 5K, 2700p, which is still practically unheard of in most porn circles. I told you this shit was from the future.</p><p></p><p>Some stats are visible on the front-page screenshot for all the movies, though I think they’re the same for each. The flicks are in 3D, HD, at 60 fps with binaural audio so it really sounds like you’re in the scene. All the clips I watched were 180 degrees, which is really all you need for a porn scene. It’s not like the bitches are going to come up behind you or anything. That’s a different kind of VR porno site.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Hitting the Virtual Gym, Porno Style</h3><p></p><p></p><p>If you’re using the built-in video player, you can only view in 4k, not 5k. That should be enough for most perverts, but you really should be downloading any videos you watch onto your VR headset. Having the clips pre-loaded in your device means there will be less latency. The first-person humping will look clearer and crisper, and you’ll be less likely to get motion sickness.</p><p></p><p>Full Body Workout: Bro Edition opens with the gorgeous and curvy Sofia Lee working out, as you may have guessed. She stretches on a yoga mat in a living room somewhere, ass up toward you, our hero on the couch with the camera on his head. Fives minutes in, she’s bobbing her head on your cock. The doggystyle sequence comes a few minutes later, and you should cum shortly after that.</p><p></p><p>The whole scene is half an hour long. Sofia really did something for me, so after I finished, I downloaded her other clip on VirtualTaboo. This one was a lighter solo scene, featuring tit play, masturbation, and plenty of shots of that succulent ass.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Stepson Blowjobs and Stepmom Anal</h3><p></p><p></p><p>VirtualTaboo has 120 tags corresponding to various kinds of filthy sex. Naturally, since this is a taboo site, there’s usually at least an attempt to keep it all in the family. You’ll find stepsisters taking it in the Anal section and stepmoms filed under Foot Fetish. Swimming Pool Sex is good for keeping that sibling rivalry under control, and the whole gang is invited to Group Sex.</p><p></p><p>This site is a decent value if you’re into watching POV porn on a tablet or a computer. The girls are beautiful and talented, and the production is literally state of the art. The movies they’re putting out are top-shelf in the genre.</p><p></p><p>VirtualTaboo really shines if you have access to any kind of VR gadget, though, even something as simple as Google Cardboard. I would expect to pay a few bucks extra to get this content in this format, but they’re charging the same thirty bucks a month as all the non-VR sites. Cash in before they figure it out.</p>"}},{"id":"24e4a1d10bc2","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"24e4a1d10bc2","title":"Dark Room VR","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"DarkRoomVR.com is a very new VR porn site full of oppression and humiliation as well as forced sex videos and it promises weekly updates","canonical":"https://theporndude.com/zh/5954/darkroomvr","affiliate_url":"https://darkroomvr.com?nats=NjIuMS4zLjEyLjAuMC4wLjAuMA&switched=1&strack=0&amp%3Bstrack=0","rating":4,"siteOrder":12,"price":"free","tags":["VR"],"features":[],"categories":[{"id":"best-vr-porn-sites","collection":"categories_en"}],"screenshot_url":"https://cdn.staticstack.net/assets/img/r-thumbs/64d6c07-darkroomvr_small.png","image_alt":"Dark Room VR, virtual reality porn site","scraped_at":"2025-10-28T21:09:49.381Z","iconSpritesheet":"default","logoIconClass":"icon568","pros":["premium vr porn","domination, humiliation and rough sex","hot euro and us pornstars","free video previews","downloads included","weekly updates","low price"],"cons":["new site, small collection"],"detailedDescription":"<p>DarkRoomVR might be what you think it is, but I guess it depends on what kind of pervert you are. If you’re hoping this is a photography-themed virtual reality game where you develop photos in chemical vats lit by a red light, well, you’re out of luck and also showing your age. Who the fuck produces film anymore? Certainly not the smut peddlers here, who are hawking premium VR pornos at up to 7k resolution.</p><p></p><p>DarkRoomVR.com hasn’t been online very long at all, springing up in the middle of 2024’s epic year of fucking disaster. Hey, at least some good things came out of this year’s worldwide clusterfuck, including the VR fucks you’ll find in this exploration of your filthiest sex fantasies. Let’s take a look at the dark twist these depraved deviates are putting on the immersive 3D format.</p><h3>Enter the Dark Room VR</h3><p></p><p></p><p>If the low lighting, covered mouths and dungeon settings don’t spell it out for you, maybe those movie titles will. The thumbnail for Demon In Me features a creeper lurking in the dark behind a young 18+ hottie, and I’m getting Wednesday Addams vibes from the pigtailed brunette getting disciplined in Do What We Say, Little Bitch. The chick in Blind Date Gone Wrong looks like she matched with a couple of masked goons on Tinder, while the blondie star of She Is My Fuck Toy is in no position to say otherwise.</p><p></p><p>Just in case you’re the kind of retard who needs things spelled out, let me do the honors: <strong>DarkRoomVR.com specializes in hardcore VR porn full of domination, humiliation and rough sex</strong>. They’ve got the double blowjobs, pussy-eating and cowgirl dick rides you expect from a good VR porn site, all wrapped in a layer of kinkiness that’ll appeal to your darkest desires.</p><p></p><p>They work with a mix of European and American pornstars, though there aren’t many recognizable faces on the menu, and I say that as a dude who watches porn for a living. That said, whoever’s casting these bitches knows how to spot a worthwhile fuck. They’ve got a sexy selection of babes, from 18+ teens to MILFs.</p><h3>The Eternal Darkness of Free VR Porn Trailers</h3><p></p><p></p><p>“You’re here to get a new job, am I right?” asks the slut behind the desk, doing her best to impersonate a boss giving an interview. “Are you capable of doing… more than… just a lot?” she manages to improvise. I’d laugh if I wasn’t staring at her legs and hoping they’d come out of the stockings. A moment later, both girls were at my feet, with the boss giving the new trainee a BJ lesson. “You little whore,” she says, “open your throat for him!”</p><p></p><p>The montage switches to a doggystyle VR shot against the brown leather couch, followed by missionary with the boss holding the younger 18+ chick’s arms down. They take some quick turns riding my virtual dick, but the trailer ends after just two minutes, leaving me with blue balls and a strong desire to experience more of what DarkRoomVR has to offer.</p><h3>Holy Shit, That’s Some Cheap VR Smut</h3><p></p><p></p><p>I expected a decent price, but it turns out <strong>DarkRoomVR.com is one of the cheapest VR paysites I’ve seen</strong>. A monthly membership is only ten bucks a pop right now. They say that’s 50% off the regular price, which means you’re getting a deal even at the full rate. As usual, the longer memberships are cheaper, with a Lifetime subscription for $250.</p><p></p><p>There is a downside, though, and I think that cheap rate is probably directly related. Because DarkRoomVR.com is such a new site, they’ve still got a pretty small collection. I’m writing this in December and they’ve only got ten movies so far.</p><p></p><p>On the upside, <strong>the Dark Room VR signup page promises weekly updates</strong>. That’s pretty much my golden standard for paysite release schedules, so I’m happy with what I see. Not only does it guarantee you’ve got a dark new VR porno to drop yourself into every week, but it also ensures the collection will grow quickly. By the time you read this, there may be a lot more than ten flicks in the archive.</p><h3>Banging the Burglar (That’s You)</h3><p></p><p></p><p>I should mention that DarkRoomVR has a range of downloadable files for every movie, so you can be sure it’s going to work on whatever virtual reality headset you’re beating off with. Masturbate into the future with one of the pricier Oculus gizmos, fap on your gaming machine with PSVR, or even bang these virtual sluts on a last-gen phone-based contraption. Whatever you do, make sure you’ve got a good pair of headphones or earbuds to truly appreciate the binaural audio.</p><p></p><p>I couldn’t refuse the black-haired babe sucking two dicks in the thumbnail for Offer You Can’t Refuse, so that’s where I conducted my real fap test of the site. I went into it without even reading the synopsis, hoping for some surprises, and goddamn, does Dark Room VR deliver!</p><p></p><p>The film opens with you and the lovely Mia enjoying each other’s company in a dimly lit living room. Mia’s wearing stockings and a tight black top, putting me in the mood immediately. When we see a flashlight in the hallway, my wimpy stunt cock lets the lady go investigate. Naturally, she’s screaming and terrified as a masked burglar forces his way in.</p><p></p><p>What follows is an erotic first-person descent into harsh domination and dirty sex. The perspective switches, making you the burglar as the boyfriends begs and Mia flirts. She sucks your virtual cock while the pussy dude cowers, but it’s only a matter of time until the whole thing devolves into a cum-drenched threesome.</p><p></p><p>The dark mood and intense situations is the main thing that sets Dark Room VR apart from the other VR paysites out there, in this film and the rest of them. While most sites will occasionally dabble in some lightly rough stuff and forceful scenarios, these guys go hard as fuck with it and make that their whole gimmick.</p><p></p><p>It’s niche porn, sure, and while it may not appeal much to the average TeamSkeet viewer, those of you who like a harder edge to your VR smut are going to eat it up. The only real downside is the small collection, a side effect of their newness on the market. The price is low as hell, though, making DarkRoomVR.com a killer deal on dark VR porn. With new movies coming out every week, it’s only going to get better with time.</p>"}},{"id":"8722452eee23","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"8722452eee23","title":"AdultTime VR","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"AdultTime.com has one of the best virtual reality content you can find on porn sites, including 300 3D porn and more than 60k videos on the internet every day","canonical":"https://theporndude.com/zh/13972/adulttimevr","affiliate_url":"https://www.adulttime.com/track/go.php?pr=8&su=1&si=247&ad=276620&cl=/vr&ar=&buffer=","rating":5,"siteOrder":13,"price":"free","tags":[],"features":[],"categories":[{"id":"best-vr-porn-sites","collection":"categories_en"}],"screenshot_url":"https://cdn.staticstack.net/assets/img/r-thumbs/e3085ab-adulttimevr_small.png","image_alt":"AdultTime VR, virtual reality porn site","scraped_at":"2025-10-28T21:09:54.508Z","iconSpritesheet":"default","logoIconClass":"icon424","pros":["premium virtual reality porno movies","multiple big-name brands","top-shelf pornstars","part of adulttime network (400+ channels, 60,000+ episodes, 8+ releases per day)","cheap streaming-only memberships","discount bot","fresh vr releases daily","~300 virtual reality pornos","100+ vids with interactive toy capability","excellent range of vr content"],"cons":["you’ll probably want the more expensive membership if you’re watching vr"],"detailedDescription":"<p>I’ve written about AdultTime before, but VR has never been my focus until today. This isn’t a new feature, as they’ve been stocking the 3D stuff as part of their network for a while now, but it seemed like a good day to take a closer look at their whole Virtual Reality porn stash. Meta Quest 3 launched a few months ago and Apple just unveiled their Vision Pro headset, once again bringing the technology into the spotlight. If you just got an expensive new headset for Christmas, well, it might be the day to fill that sucker up with highly immersive fuck flicks.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>With a steady 4 million visitors a month lately, AdultTime.com is one of the most popular adult websites in the world. They’re not just a singular paysite, either, but <strong>a sprawling network of all types of smut—VR included</strong>! Check out my other writeup if you want an overview of the whole site; today, I’m strapping on my sex helmet and fapping my way into the future. Who’s with me?</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>All the Big Names Under One Roof</h3><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>For one thing, this place is crawling with big-name brands that you already know and love. Their Virtual Reality selection includes content from BaDoinkVR, SexBabesVR, VRHush, Virtual Real Porn, VRSpy and VRBangers, just to name a few I’ve reviewed here at MissAVDH. Their selection of 2D porno is even wider, with movies from studios like Vivid, PureTaboo, Girlsway and 21Sextury.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>If you’re familiar with any of these brands, you know they ain’t shooting with just any random slut they find smoking pole behind the local 7-11. Instead, <strong>you’ll find a ton of famous, recognizable pornstars fucking and sucking</strong>. Recent Adult Time VR flicks have featured babes like Lily Larimar, Leanna Lovings, Alina Lopez, Adriana Chechik and Riley Reid.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>I even spotted a handful of VR movies with chicks I’ve boned on MissAVDHCasting couch, like Gianna Dior, Sophia Burns, Veronica Church, Maddy May and Spencer Bradley. If you’ve ever wanted to step into my big-ass cartoon shoes, well, this might be as close as you’ll get--at least until I launch my own VR site!</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Cheap Tickets and Tons of Porn</h3><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>The lack of downloads with the regular membership is a bummer, especially for VR users who can definitely use those extra pixels for videos released in 8k. The yearly plan breaks down to about $12 a month and includes downloads, so that’s what I’d recommend if you’ve got a futuristic computer box on your head. If you want to test out the streaming quality before you pull the trigger, they’ve got a $3 trial membership.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Oh, and there’s a good chance you can score a discount through the bot on the signup page. If you take your sweet-ass time looking at the page without making a decision, a chat window will pop up offering you up to a 50% break on those prices. I’ve come back to Adult Time again and again over the years and that bot still pops up, so I think it’s always lurking with its secret coupons.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>I’ve mentioned the absurd size and scope of AdultTime a few times already, but how about some hard numbers to put it all in context? <strong>They’ve got over 400 channels, more than 60,000 episodes, and they’re dropping at least 8 new videos a day</strong>. Most of this ain’t VR, but as we’ll see in a second here, fans of next-level pornographic immersion are not going to be disappointed.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>AdultTime’s VR Stash by the Numbers</h3><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>It's worth mentioning that while AdultTime’s signup page promises 8+ updates per day, you usually get even more. That’s why there’s a Plus symbol. They add new VR content almost every day, and lately we’re seeing a lot of multi-video days. In just the past two days, they’ve released four movies: two straight pornos, a gay flick and one trans sex movie, all in glorious, realistic VR. (In case you’re wondering, the gay and trans movies constitute just a small fraction of the VR stash. Tweaking my settings to exclude them, I still had over 250 VR movies to choose from.)</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>If you’re the type of tech-oriented geek who loves strapping multiple electronic devices to your body while you masturbate, have I got some great news for you. <strong>Over a hundred of those VR movies have interactive toy scripts</strong>, and I’m sure they’ll be releasing more and more videos with this feature. SexLikeReal charges extra for this, so I’m happy to see it included here. You can currently use a handful of devices like Handy, Lovense, Kiiroo and Svakom. These things really suck, and I mean that in the best way possible. Why simulate that blowjob with your hand when you can have a machine slurping away?</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>It’s Adult Time—In VR!</h3><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>It is a little overwhelming deciding where to start, though. I was tempted to revisit one of the gals I’ve boned on MissAVDHCasting couch, but ended up tuning in to a recent half-hour BaDoinkVR movie called Peek-A-Boo, starring the enigmatic Ashlyn Peaks.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>The insanely crisp 7K video opens with Ashlyn welcoming you to her pleasure palace. “I’ll be taking care of you today, so don’t worry about anything.” It’s an intimate scene with something of a GFE vibe. Ashlyn speaks sweetly as she asks for a kiss and then offers a tit wank. The binaural audio is great, and I highly recommend headphones if you want to get those ASMR tingles when she whispers in your ear.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>It's a fantastic bit of smut, made even better by the immersion of virtual reality. Early vids in the genre, just a few years ago, had all kinds of issues with bad angles and out-of-focus boobies. This one feels very realistic, and it’s par for the course here at AdultTime. These are movies from major studios, after all.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>AdultTime.com is always one of my easiest recommendations for porn fans looking for a big catalog, a wide selection and a low price. They’ve been killing it for years, and I think their rapidly growing VR selection is going to attract a whole lot of new customers who are looking for something to do in VR besides slice fruit. With around 300 virtual reality pornos and faster updates than your average VR paysite, this one’s a bargain even if you’re sticking to the headset niche—but I don’t think you will.</p>"}},{"id":"a67e91cc9940","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"a67e91cc9940","title":"BaDoink Studios","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"BaDoink.com is one of the original paid VR porn sites and is still one of the best ones.

They launched in 2016, back when only the real geeks were shelling out the big money required to see some boobies in 3D. Some of you may have also experimented with the lo-fi, phone-based headsets of the time, which were still painfully pricey for what they delivered.</p><p></p><p>I don’t think I have to tell you that Virtual Reality has come a long fucking way since then, and so has the brand. <strong>BaDoink.com is a massively popular VR porn network with a handful of sites under their umbrella</strong>. They get an easy million visitors a month, and that’s just on the central domain. I’ve written about the company and their sites a bunch of times here at MissAVDH, but seeing as they just launched a new subscription bundle, it seemed like a good day to revisit and see what’s new.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>A Growing VR Porn Empire</h3><p></p><p></p><p>As a professional, I respect those professional opinions, but it’s the visuals that really catch my attention. Where do I even begin? For one thing, <strong>they’re working with a ton of big names and rising porn starlets</strong>. If you’re a regular porn consumer, you’ll immediately recognize chicks like Katie Kush, Blake Blossom and Adriana Chechik. I couldn’t help noticing a bunch of recent guests have also graced MissAVDHCasting couch, like Lily Lou, April Olsen, Kay Lovely and Lana Smalls.</p><p></p><p>BaDoink currently has half a dozen brands. Speaking as a guy who wanks his way around the internet for a living, I can tell you that most successful porn networks tend to keep expanding outwards, so I think we’ll see more sites popping up at some point. The current crop includes BaDoinkVR, VRCosplayX, KinkVR, BannedStories, BabeVR and 18VR.</p><p></p><p>Even if you’ve never checked out any of these sites, you can probably guess from the names that there’s <strong>a nice, wide variety of content across the network</strong>. The dropdown menu of Categories on the video search page includes all the standards like Lesbians and Latinas, Anal and Asians, plus the freaky stuff you expect from a site like KinkVR: BDSM, Foot Fetish and more.</p><p></p><p>I was a bit disappointed to find most of the “Play” buttons out front just send you to the signup page instead of letting you watch anything. This is a common bait-and-switch in premium porn, but the VR sites typically let you download some freebies since streaming ain’t always crisp enough. The good news is what they offer instead: they’ll give you one full VR porno in exchange for your email address. That sounds like a deal to me!</p><p></p><p></p><h3>How Much VR Porn You Looking For?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>The main reason I came back today, though, was BaDoink.com’s new Super Bundle. For about the price of two regular paysites, you get 5 VR ones. Every BaDoink brand is included except for BannedStories. The current rate is $70 a month or a yearly rate that breaks down to about $25 a month. That latter plan is ultimately cheaper than a monthly subscription to a traditional 2D paysite like my own MissAVDHCasting.</p><p></p><p>Whether you go for the standard membership or the Super Bundle, you’re going to get a hell of a lot of porno. There are around 800 videos on BaDoinkVR itself, and thousands of movies across the network. It’s not quite the ridiculous selection of an iTunes-style VR site such as SexLikeReal, but you’d be hard pressed to find a stash this big from any other singular membership.</p><p></p><p>The update situation is likewise impressive. If you’re subscribing to the Super Bundle, you’ll be able to watch fresh VR pornos almost every day. BaDoinkVR and VRCosplayX are updating every few days, 18VR once a week, and KinkVR gets a new one about every 10 days. I couldn’t find any upload dates on BabeVR, but I have to assume they’re getting regular releases, too. This ain’t a company known for slacking!</p><p></p><p>Runtimes are fucking solid, too. Some sites with extensive collections skimp on the durations, and some will even chop up longer films into multiple releases. I’d say the average video length across the BaDoink.com network is about 45 minutes to an hour, though BabeVR vids tend to run a bit shorter. I hope you bought a fat battery pack, because you can stay in VR porno world indefinitely!</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Getting Some Cosplay Action in VR</h3><p></p><p></p><p>The 48-minute VR film opens with a VRCosplay X logo before Madame Lana appears on the screen, rocking a tight, shiny spider outfit. The comic-book setup is the kind of over-the-top fun you expect from classic sex cinema, a little cheesy but a perfect complement to the boobies, butts and penetration.</p><p></p><p>The naughty stuff starts with some over-the-pants foot play before Lana climbs on top. The scene’s shot with a human stand-in instead of those dummies you see in a lot of VR, and her costar does a great job staying semi-invisible; I could easily forget that wasn’t actually my dick Lana was slurping on.</p><p></p><p>It's a nice, long fuck flick with plenty of time to develop. The fine folks at BaDoink.com have years of practice under their belt at this point, so I never ran into issues with bad angles or out-of-focus faces or anything. Instead, I got a crystal-clear, first-person view of footjobs, cowgirl rides, cocksucking, doggystyle and missionary, with some sexy little surprises along the way.</p><p></p><p>I tested out BaDoinkVR today using the Prism app on my Meta Quest 3. It was my first time using Prism, and I thought the quality looked better than DeoVR, which I’ve been viewing some other VR porn sites with. Prism doesn’t yet let you skip to specific sexy sequences in a video like DeoVR, but hopefully the functionality is on the way.</p><p></p><p>VR streaming looks better than it ever has, but you’ll probably still want to download the movies if you’ve got a high-end headset and want the ultimate quality. <strong>Downloads are included with the membership</strong>, so go ahead and stock up. I know I’m going to.</p><p></p><p>It ain’t difficult to see why BaDoink.com has maintained their crown even as VR porn continues to explode in popularity. They got a head start on everyone else, and they’ve been putting out cutting-edge, highly immersive porno scenes from the very beginning. Their formula has been further refined over the years, and you can see the payoff in every dirty 3D movie they put out.

The immersive 3D niche has struggled more than the nerds expected, likely because the technology didn’t exactly explode the way they wanted it to. I think it’s finally achieving mainstream success, though, and there’s a good chance you’re here because you just got a new Meta Quest or splurged on an Apple Vision Pro. Get ready for some good news for your new toy, my friends.</p><p></p><p>I’ve written about Faphouse.com a bunch of times here at MissAVDH. They’ve got a sprawling collection of full-length premium porno movies from all sorts of studios, a secret sauce that earns them hundreds of millions of visitors a month. They’ve applied the same formula to VR here, and now offer a growing and varied stash of Virtual Reality fuck flicks. I’ve been a fan of the site for a while, so naturally I couldn’t wait to fire up my futuristic sex helmet and get fapping.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>It's FapHouse, but with Virtual Reality</h3><p></p><p></p><p>The VR section is much newer than the rest of the site, so I was expecting a less impressive spread. Turns out, I was wrong. They’ve already got a nice range of VR studios, producers and paysites uploading their content to FapHouse. It’s a smaller selection than elsewhere on the site, sure, but they’ve already got a bunch of recognizable brands like VRCosplayX, Blush Erotica VR, Virtual Taboo and TMW VR Net.</p><p></p><p>As much as I love discovering new studios, there’s something to be said for the known quantities. I know that big-name outfits like BaDoinkVR and 18VR are going to come through not just with high production values, but high-quality talent, too. Sure enough, <strong>FapHouse’s VR stash has a ton of famous pornstars, not to mention gorgeous rising starlets</strong>.</p><p></p><p>Case in point, they’ve got a Legend of Korra parody porno from VRCosplayX, and it’s got both Karlee Grey and Abella Danger. Within seconds, I’d also spotted familiar faces like Little Caprice, Jessa Rhodes, Angel Wicky, and one of my personal favorites going way back, Krystal Swift. I swear, I’ve been cranking it to that thicc mama forever, so I couldn’t wait to try it in VR.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Cheaper Than Old-Time Flat Porno</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Speaking of, <strong>FapHouse VR memberships are cheaper than a typical paysite</strong>. Twenty bucks gets you access for a month, while most of the 2D porn sites want thirty. The yearly rate breaks down to just over eight bucks a month, which is fucking fantastic, or you can go all-in on a lifetime VR plan for $250.</p><p></p><p>It's worth mentioning here that the VR package doesn’t include access to the rest of Fap House. Their pricing can get a little convoluted with all the different packages available, but can save you some serious coin compared to regular paysites and content platforms like OnlyFans. The Fap House VR pricing hasn’t yet been complicated by token-based purchases or fanclub memberships, but I kind of expect it as more studios get on board.</p><p></p><p>As much as I wish FapHouse.com was a one-price, all-inclusive paysite, you have to consider the benefits for us masturbators. The pricing scheme here is a lot more attractive to pornographers, who stand to make more money, which ultimately means we get more porn in more flavors. That selection is one of the major reasons Fap House has blown up the way it has in just a few years.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Watch How Fast This One Grows</h3><p></p><p></p><p><strong>They’re also promising ten new VR adult films per week</strong>. I like to see at least one new release a week on any site you’ve got to pay for, so as you can see, this is a serious fucking bang for your buck. For years, VR sites were cheaper than their 2D counterparts, but the trend has been dying as the tech becomes more popular. I’m always happy to see platforms keeping it old-school on the pricing!</p><p></p><p>This is the kind of thing that’s going to snowball, too. Right now, Fap House only has 16 studios contributing to their VR stash. As more producers join the lineup, we’ll see the library growing faster and faster. Given how popular VR has been getting—for SFW purposes and for jacking off—I think we’re going to see some crazy growth in the near future. I’m hoping to see a bunch of the studios on Faphouse branch out into VR, and bring even more 3D fun to the platform.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>FapHouse VR vs SexLikeReal</h3><p></p><p></p><p>I’d say the biggest advantage they have over SexLikeReal at this point is just that FapHouse ain’t a strictly VR site. You’ll have to spend a few more bucks to unlock more of the site, sure, but memberships are cheap. For less than the price of a regular paysite, you can get access to a massive and diverse catalog of 2D and 3D pornos. Let’s face it, even if you’re a huge VR nerd, sometimes it’s just too much work to get your headgear all set up. Sometimes you just want to blow a load in the restroom at McDonald’s before you get back to your soul-crushing job, and it’s just more convenient to do that with your phone than your $4000 Apple status symbol.</p><p></p><p>I’d like to see FapHouse VR get better app support, too. One of the big advantages of SexLikeReal is that it’s compatible with the DeoVR browser, which improves the whole experience. VR can add some extra steps to the whole masturbatory process, so it’s good to streamline that wherever possible. To date, FapHouse has proven themselves pretty savvy about delivering what masturbators want, so I imagine there’s something on the way.</p><p></p><p>FapHouse.com has established themselves in a way most paysites never will in just a few short years, and it’s all because they offer such a big-ass, wide-ranging collection of porno from such a varied range of producers. They’re doing the exact same thing with their new VR section, and it’s already an easy recommendation for anybody looking for a diverse collection of 3D movies that put you right in the porn stud’s shoes. This stash has a high potential to explode as more studios get on board, and I really think it’s just a matter of time. Tickets are cheap, so step right up and enjoy the show.</p>"}},{"id":"02af5cb3f8d6","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"02af5cb3f8d6","title":"Brazzers VR","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"BrazzersVR.com is an immersive 3D porn movie home from one of the biggest and worst brands in the game dozens of movies starring top porn stars for free","canonical":"https://theporndude.com/zh/21185/brazzersvr","affiliate_url":"https://landing.brazzersvr.com/?ats=eyJhIjoxNzYsImMiOjI3OTcwMTcsIm4iOjEyNywicyI6NjkwLCJlIjoxMDU5MCwicCI6Mn0=&atc=Autocampaign_Default","rating":4,"siteOrder":16,"price":"free","tags":["免费","VR"],"features":["游戏"],"categories":[{"id":"best-vr-porn-sites","collection":"categories_en"}],"screenshot_url":"https://cdn.staticstack.net/assets/img/r-thumbs/8435872-brazzersvr_small.png","image_alt":"Brazzers VR, VR Porn Site","scraped_at":"2025-10-28T21:10:13.377Z","iconSpritesheet":"custom-favicon-spritesheet.png","iconPosition":"-192px -912px","iconClassName":"ctm-icon21185","logoIconClass":"icon21185","pros":["premium vr porno from brazzers","free previews","top-shelf talent","a great range of content","33 immersive 3d vids and counting","downloads included with membership"],"cons":["can’t download the free trailers","unclear release schedule"],"detailedDescription":"<p>Out of all the VR porn sites out there, BrazzersVR might have the very most recognizable name to the average pervert. It’s kind of ironic, because they ain’t the newest kid on the high-tech virtual block, but they’ve certainly established themselves as absolute kings of internet smut over the last couple decades. I’m sure there are fans signing up on brand recognition alone, but I’ll tell you right now, this isn’t some half-assed effort cashing in on the company’s reputation. No, this is exactly the kind of high-level explicit hardcore erotica you expect when you see those dual yellow Zs, only now it’s in mind-blowing 3D.</p><p></p><p><strong>Yes, BrazzersVR.com is just what you think it is: premium VR porno from the folks behind Brazzers</strong>, whose work needs little introduction to anybody who’s beaten off to the internet at any point in the 21st century. The VR imprint only gets a fraction of the visitors as the main site, but a fraction of 15 million is still pretty fucking impressive. Virtual Reality sex is still kind of a deep niche, seeing as you need some pricey headgear to really enjoy it, but here’s another reason to go pick some up.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>It's Brazzers, but in Virtual Reality</h3><p></p><p></p><p>And just what do you expect those beautiful girls are doing on a site like BrazzersVR? Step right up if you guessed they were sucking cock, riding it, sandwiching it between their titties, and fooling around with their lesbian friends. <strong>There’s a great variety of hardcore activity going on around here</strong>, and it’s well organized. The Categories/Tags menu offers quick access to X-rated subgenres like Anal, Asian and Ass-To-Mouth, though I expected no less from the brand.</p><p></p><p><strong>There are free Brazzers VR trailers</strong>, but unfortunately, you can’t download them. Most sites want to tease you with the full quality you can typically only get with a big-ass download, but I’m guessing they’re trying to nudge customers to the one-dollar trial membership. It gives you better access, but be warned, it autobills at a slightly higher rate than the regular package.</p><p></p><p>It's worth mentioning here that BrazzersVR.com is brought to you by Aylo, formerly known as MindGeek. They’ve got a bunch of free and premium sites under their umbrella, including Pornhub. If you live in one of 17 states where they legislate boners, you’ll be blocked from BrazzersVR just like you are from the ‘Hub. It’s easy enough to get around the bouncer with a VPN on a laptop or iPad, but it’s still kind of a bitch on a Quest. With any luck, we’ll see some VPNs in the Meta Store soon, but until then, the easiest thing to do is just download the movies with a VPN on your computer and then load them onto the Quest. Sorry if you were hoping to stream, but hey, you’ll get better visual quality this way.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Futuristic Porn for the Same Price as the Regular Stuff</h3><p></p><p></p><p>By the numbers, BrazzersVR.com is smaller than a lot of the other big-name VR porn paysites. That ain’t surprising, as they haven’t been around quite as long. As of this writing, the catalog consists of 33 immersive pornos that put you right in the stud’s shoes. Runtimes are solid, typically clocking in between 30 and 40 minutes, so you’ve got plenty of content to keep you cranking between updates.</p><p></p><p>Speaking of, one of my only complaints about the general setup of the site is that they don’t list upload dates. I always like to tell my readers how often they can expect new flicks to shake their dicks at, especially if they’re going to be paying for the privilege, but I just can’t do that here. That said, I always expect good things from Brazzers. They didn’t get where they are through bait-and-switch scams, but by offering up exactly what their customers want. If they don’t do that here, I’ll eat my oversized novelty glasses, plus my giant shoes for dessert.</p><p></p><p>Brazzers includes more ads than I like to see on premium sites, though you can get some deals adding other studios to your membership. I do wish they kept the focus on VR content even when hawking third-party material, seeing as that’s the whole reason so many of us tuned in to 3D version of Brazzers. I think some VR offerings could be nice, but this feels more like unwanted spam.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Is Angela White Really in the Room?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>We get a little private bikini exhibition before Angela climbs over the ottoman in front of the viewer, kneels, and starts massaging. She strokes through sweatpants at first, and when that cock comes out, she puts it in her mouth. The VR elevates the experience way above your typical POV blowjob scene, and Angela’s breathy voice sounds beautiful in my headphones.</p><p></p><p>There’s a nice titwank, making use of some of Angela’s most famous assets, and then she turns around to show off another as she sits down on the viewer’s hog. One of the most frustrating things about VR is that she’s close enough for me to touch, but the illusion will be ruined if I try. I call it the strip club effect, since you can’t touch the merchandise, but it still feels a lot more real than watching a dirty movie on a flat screen. If you own a pocket pussy, you owe it to yourself to lube it up for this movie.</p><p></p><p>If you love big tits bouncing in your face, you’re going to love the cowgirl segment. Like any good site, <strong>downloads are included with your Brazzers VR membership</strong>. As mentioned before, these films will always look best if you download, but I think this one’s a worthy contender for your permanent spank bank in any case. Hell, I’m already planning on beating off to it again later. I popped before I even realized there was a footjob coming up, and well, I’m a bit of a completist when it comes to these things.</p><p></p><p>I try not to sound like too much a fanboy when I’m writing reviews, but man, BrazzersVR.com really knocks it out of the park. They’re making exactly the kind of high-quality dirty movies their fans expect, applying their award-winning formula to the newfangled world of Virtual Reality porno. They’re a relative newcomer to VR, but they’ve clearly been studying the format, as I didn’t see any wonky angles, out-of-focus faces or other issues you sometimes get from the new guys. The free previews are a little scant, but a buck gets you a better sneak peek at what’s inside.</p>"}},{"id":"1308942487c8","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"1308942487c8","title":"VirtualRealPassion","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"VirtualRealPassion.com offers quality women from VirtualRealPorn POV XXX VR porn including 180 movies famous porn stallion and downloads","canonical":"https://theporndude.com/zh/23021/virtualrealpassion-website-review","affiliate_url":"https://virtualrealpassion.com?nats=OTk5MTAwMDguNS4yLjIuMC4wLjAuMC4w","rating":4,"siteOrder":16,"price":"free","tags":["VR","下载"],"features":["下载"],"categories":[{"id":"premium-porn-for-women-sites","collection":"categories_en"},{"id":"best-vr-porn-sites","collection":"categories_en"}],"screenshot_url":"https://cdn.staticstack.net/assets/img/r-thumbs/b45ab12-virtualrealpassion-website-review_small.png","image_alt":"VirtualRealPassion, a paid porn site for women","scraped_at":"2025-10-28T20:12:29.028Z","iconSpritesheet":"custom-favicon-spritesheet.png","iconPosition":"-352px -960px","iconClassName":"ctm-icon23021","logoIconClass":"icon23021","pros":["premium vr porn for women (female pov)","a great range of passionate sex","free downloadable trailers","cheap memberships","synchronized teledildonics with compatible toys","~180 female pov vr pornos","about 4 updates per month","downloads included","famous pornstars, hunky studs and rising amateurs"],"cons":["tried to opt me into a pricey add-on membership"],"detailedDescription":"<p>When I first heard of Virtual Real Passion, I actually assumed they were riffing on the title of VirtualRealPorn, one of the OG VR porn sites on the market. Copycat titles are a common thing in this business, and I’ve even seen a fair number of half-assed copies of MissAVDH out there in the wild, but this ain’t another lame cash grab with a familiar name. This one’s actually brought to you by the same masturbatory masterminds behind VirtualRealPorn, though the focus and target demographics are a bit different. My usual audience of horny straight dudes might not appreciate this one as much as the older platform, but I think the ladies are going to love it.</p><p></p><p>VirtualRealPassion.com hypes itself as the “World’s first VR porn site for women.” Female-oriented porn tends to come bundled with certain storyline tropes, stylistic considerations and a heightened sense of intimacy and passion, though there’s another obvious and stark difference here. <strong>One of the main gimmicks is that this premium VR porn is shot from the woman’s POV</strong>, making it a better fit for horny gals wearing a futuristic sci-fi sex helmet. It ain’t my usual thing, but given how much I love VirtualRealPorn, I knew I needed a closer look at what all they’re offering. Let’s get right into it.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>First-Person Female VR Erotica</h3><p></p><p></p><p>The front-page thumbnails have that title card presentation you usually find on VR sites, but you do get a moving preview when you move your mouse over one. <strong>The sex is passionate and comes in a variety of freaky styles</strong>. The spread of recent releases as I type this up includes a game night hookup, some erotic jacuzzi tomfoolery, POV lesbian encounters, intimate BDSM and a fair number of buff dudes doing MMF threesomes in virtual reality. The full VirtualRealPassion Categories page covers the porno basics as well as female-oriented subgenres like Muscle and Bearded. There’s also an Actual Couple aisle, which I’ve always thought should be more common even on sites not aimed squarely at female masturbators. It’s hard to beat that intimacy if you’re shooting with strangers.</p><p></p><p><strong>They offer free video trailers, and since this is VR, you can even download them</strong>. I peeked at the preview for the latest feature, Stuck, which opens with a European dude helping the POV starlet out of her clothes. It’s slightly different from the “stuck” scenarios with girls trapped in washing machines, but get a load of that POV tit sucking, tit fucking, cunnilingus and twat stuffing. Truth be told, this was my first time watching VR from a woman’s perspective, and despite the POV switcheroo, I was pretty fucking turned on by the time that 70 seconds was up.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Cheap Tix, Interactive Toys and a Big Stash</h3><p></p><p></p><p>More and more of the big VR sites have been rolling out teledildonic options, letting customers sync their high-tech cock strokers with the movies being beamed straight to their eyeballs. I wasn’t really expecting that at VirtualRealPassion.com given their focus, but <strong>they impressed me with toy-compatible interactive VR porn for women</strong>. A ton of these flicks work with Lovense and Kiiroo units, and I expect more options as the market continues to expand.</p><p></p><p>As of this writing, there are around 180 female POV VR pornos available at Virtual Real Passion. Platforms dabbling in uncommon niches sometimes skimp out on the runtimes, but these flicks are nice and long. I’d say the average is about 45 minutes, so you’ve got plenty of content to lay back and enjoy without having to change the channel every few minutes.</p><p></p><p>As with all but the most infuriating of VR porn sites, <strong>downloads are included with the VirtualRealPassion membership</strong>. Some of you are about to learn just how limiting the storage space is on even the more expensive Quest 3, because the 8K movies can be up to 15 gigs easy. VR streaming has really improved in recent years and I usually just go that route, though downloads still provide the very highest resolution. I’m surprised VirtualRealPassion isn’t currently compatible with any of the VR porn viewers like DeoVR, seeing as VirtualRealPorn is a trailblazer, but hopefully that’s something in the works.</p><p></p><p>Updates aren’t the steady weekly releases I like to see on paysites, but I’m willing to cut Virtual Real Passion a little slack here on account of the cheap entry fees. You still get about four updates per month, and given those runtimes, you’re not going to be aching for something to watch while you diddle your skittle to completion.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Experiencing Real Passion, Virtually</h3><p></p><p></p><p>One of the most recent pictures at Virtual Real Passion features Lucy Mendez behind the camera, getting some BBC from the illustrious Little Maly. It’s a 38-minute film called Gymkhana, and seemed like a good place to begin my viewing session. It opens with Lucy’s POV as she lays back in bed, Little Maly dressed for business in a tie and button-down. He reads a riddle off a page, solves it and ends up with another puzzle in his hands.</p><p></p><p>Scenarios unfold differently on sites aimed at women than ones aimed at men, and this seems like a good example of that phenomenon. They play up the intimacy more here instead of just throwing dicks around, but it only takes a few minutes to get to some slow, sensual pussy kissing, which leads to a more succulent meal. There’s a bit of fingering, but the Big Black Cock doesn’t even make an appearance until about ten minutes in.</p><p></p><p>That’s where things really heat up. Your POV stand-in fondles the guy’s balls as he grinds on “you”, and we finally get that POV penetration a few minutes later. Early VR had a lot of issues when it came to camera angles, but the folks at VirtualRealPorn have mastered the craft. If you’ve ever wanted to have a handsome, chiseled black stud fucking you passionately, eyes full of lust, this is your chance. Hell, you can spring for a subscription bundle with VirtualRealPorn and VirtualRealPassion, then both you and your husband can enjoy that expensive headset. It ain’t just for Gorilla Tag!</p><p></p><p>VirtualRealPassion.com is perhaps the easiest recommendation on the market for women looking for the perfect Virtual Reality porno. It’s not just the female perspective that makes it special, but the intimate, passionate quality of the hardcore films they’re putting out. The flicks themselves have the kind of production I look for in porn aimed at women, and would sell even in a traditional 2D format, but VR ramps up the immersion at least a couple big steps. Previews are free and abundant, so check out a few trailers if nothing else.</p>"}},{"id":"025e6cc63b01","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"025e6cc63b01","title":"CzechVR","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"CzechVR.com is a paid Czech VR porn site and this site is really great.

Step into a new world with the wonderful new bit of technology that is VR. If you haven’t tried it, then you are seriously missing out on an awesome, sexy experience when it comes to VR porn. You can be right there in the action. Hell, if you have the money you can even get one of those interactive sex toys that jerks you off in time with the videos, but even the regular experience is leagues better than those regular. boring porn videos that you’re probably still watching. And you know what makes VR porn even better? Czech sluts. These girls are fucking amazing. They will take a good dicking, and then turn around and take you down the kinky road of femdom.</p><p></p><p>Czechvr.com is an amazing site that combines VR with slutty Czech pornstars. A perfect match if you ask me. The site requires a premium membership to sign up, but I think it’s pretty reasonable for the shit you’re getting. You get access to the rest of the CzechVR network, even if the network isn’t too diverse. It comes with access to 3 VR sites “Czech VR, Czech VR Fetish, and Czech VR Casting.” I’ll get into the differences later, but they are pretty much the same site. It’s just packaged as three different ones.</p><p></p><p>This site is pretty new, which is to be expected with these VR sites. And their view count reflects that. They’ve been around since 2015 and the member section only brings in around 160 thousand views every month. The free page with the one-minute previews pulls in a little over 700 thousand, but those aren’t paying members. But, who knows, numbers don’t always reflect the quality of the site. Let’s take a dive in and check out what these kinky Czech babes have to offer.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Site Design is On Point and Navigation is a Breeze</h3><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Over 500 High-Quality VR Videos to Choose From!</h3><p></p><p></p><p>But if you can’t handle that kind of amazing quality, then they have lower streaming and download options available. The previews show that just about every single VR set is compatible with these videos. Oculus, Vive, Windows Mixed, Reality, Daydream, Smartphones, Playstation VR, and all the other ones. Plus, if you head over to their “Get Help” tab then the customer support bros will help you troubleshoot if you have any issues with the site. And each preview has links to discussions about that specific video, photo galleries for that shoot, and all the important information you need about the video.</p><p></p><p>The way you sort through videos is pretty simple here. You can organize by newest or top-rated, and then you pick if you want to view content across all three sites or just one of them. That’s about it, unless you have something specific you want to search for. The three sites are straightforward. Czech VR has general VR porn videos; Czech VR Fetish has fetish content like feet, BDSM, and more; and Czech VR Casting has VR casting couch videos. I like how they have it all split up. Yeah, it’s one site packaged as three, but the split makes it easy to browse by the different content each section has.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>No Category Page, But a Ton of Exclusive Fetish Content</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Beyond that, you can add videos to your favorites if you see something that you want to download later. Or you can make some suggestions over on the “Discussions” tab if you want to see more content by a certain pornstar, or if you have ideas for scenes or new models. I always kind of doubt how much these sites actually listen to those suggestions, but, hey, at least they have a place for you to talk to other people about VR or Czech porn in general. The page is actually pretty active, too.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>A Great VR Experience on Mobile</h3><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>MissAVDH’s Favorite Features</h3><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>MissAVDH’s Suggestion</h3><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>MissAVDH’s Final Thoughts</h3><p></p>"}},{"id":"0b96b75cbf77","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"0b96b75cbf77","title":"Virtual Porn","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"VirtualPorn.com is a paid VR porn site owned by BangBros.

The thing is, VR porn was not a reality in 1996. Hell, online porn, in general, was kind of a shit show back in the nineties, and much of what we expect these days in premium porn wasn’t established until the reality porn of the early 2000s. So who could have predicted the rise of genuinely immersive 3D porn a quarter-century later?</p><p></p><p>I don’t know who originally bought the domain, but I know who owns it now: BangBros. The copyright out front slaps their name on it with a 2004 vintage, though the current incarnation of Virtual Porn is quite a bit newer from the looks of it. As you’ve probably guessed from the name, <strong>this is a paysite stocked full of VR porn from BangBros</strong>. Honestly, the prospect of 3D pornstars is enough to get me in the door, but the BangBros brand really raises my expectations. Let’s see how the site lives up to them.</p><p></p><h3>Sexy Girls in Immersive 3D</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Whatever, though, because you didn’t come here to jerk off to the design. As crusty as the color scheme is, the thumbnails out front look sexy as fuck. I’m immediately smitten with the beautiful round ass of Kay Carter, the penetrated butthole of Marica Chanelle, and the lovely cock-infested face of Kira Perez. Kimmy Kimm is here, kissing a dick like she did mine over at MissAVDHCasting. The biggest name I see on the card is Blake Blossom, who’s making a big oh-face as she squats onto a cock in her thumbnail.</p><p></p><p>Well, I kind of expected more prominent names from BangBros, which is not to say I’m disappointed. They’re shooting Virtual Porn with some gorgeous video whores, mostly up-and-comers with an occasional recognizable face. This company’s been around long enough to spot good talent, and I don’t see any off-brand uglies or Craigslist connections on the picture menu of perversion.</p><p></p><p>So many paysites are ditching the free previews these days, expecting you to get a taste of their content on one of the free tubes and using their bandwidth. Virtual Porn is a different kind of beast, though. Most VR sites are eager to give you a real taste, and this one’s no exception; you can download free video trailers to watch on your VR scuba gear. So go ahead and treat yourself to a freebie or two before deciding if you want the full ticket. (I know a lot of you will download the trailers with no intention of signing up for membership anytime soon, and that’s fine, too.)</p><p></p><h3>Downloads, Cheap Tickets, and Other Perks</h3><p></p><p></p><p>The signup page lists some of their perks. For one thing, <strong>members get unlimited downloads</strong>. That’s not standard on every premium porn site anymore. However, VR sites basically have to let you save the movies, at least until home internet connections can stream the high quality you need when the pixels are right up against your bloodshot eyeballs.</p><p></p><p>Now, let’s talk about that quality. I mentioned the outdated vibe BangBros sometimes gives off, and I’ve got to say, I’m getting that same vibe with regards to the video quality, and I’m a little bummed out. They’re offering 5K movies, which sounds great if you’re only used to the 4K ultra-HD of flat-screen porno. In virtual reality terms, that’s last-gen. The best sites are putting out 7K movies for the high-end, modern sex helmets, and I’m disappointed that one of the biggest porn companies has not kept up with the trend.</p><p></p><p>Anyways, back to the good stuff. They’re dropping a new VirtualPorn movie like clockwork every Thursday. I like my paysites to have at least one new release per week, so this fits the bill. You, OCD pervs, can set an alert on your phone to enjoy that weekly fresh VR fap session.</p><p></p><p>BangBros is now doing this Member Rewards thing where you unlock more free porn sites just by staying signed up. It’s a good way of keeping fans on board, but it does take a little time. You get a new site every few months and a “$99 Value Special Reward” after a year. I wonder what it is!</p><p></p><h3>Banging a Pornstar’s Perfect Ass in VR</h3><p></p><p></p><p>The Kay Carter VR film I’d been eyeballing since the tour page clocks in at a clean 39 minutes. It’s VR, so you’re going to have to wait a minute to download if you really want the best experience, even if VirtualPorn.com is kind of lagging in terms of video resolution. This one’s a butt-stuff movie, titled The Anal Laundress.</p><p></p><p>Kay’s doing the laundry in front of you as the movie opens. The opening scene is where they grabbed that thumbnail that caught and maintained my interest immediately, and it’s fucking sexy as hell for an opener. Unlike 2D porn, I don’t usually skip the intros in VR. I love the immersion.</p><p></p><p>The panties come off and on during the first scene, really showing off that stunning ass. After that, the virtual stand-in stud does a lot of groping, and goddamn, I wish they could imitate the feel of succulent flesh over the Internet. The quality is visibly lower than a 7K video, but I could watch that junk jiggle in VR all day long.</p><p></p><p>The actual sex starts about ten minutes in, beginning with a really hot super-POV blowjob. Kay slurps, glurps, and spits on the thing and starts riding it backwards around the 17-minute mark. There’s that beautiful booty again! Honestly, my dudes, I think I want to hurry up and finish this review so I can watch the movie with both hands.</p><p></p><p>And while I’m overall happy with the porn on VirtualPorn, there were a couple of disappointments, namely the small library size and relatively low video resolution. I feel like these issues will work themselves out with time, though, as that’s just the nature of how porn sites evolve, and I know there’s money behind this one. The question is, should you spend your money on this one now when there are other options out there? I just reviewed 18VR earlier today, where they’re offering three releases a week, a 240-deep library of virtual reality teen movies, and 7K current-gen VR resolution for just ten bucks a month. Unfortunately, coming from there to here doesn’t make Virtual Porn look great.</p><p></p><p>My advice is to check out those free Virtual Porn trailers and see what they do for you. It’s also worth checking out if any of my complaints are still valid; if you read this review a year from now, I know they’ll have a much bigger library, and I’d bet they have 7K. At the end of the day, BangBros didn’t get where they are by putting out mediocre porn, so let’s see how they adjust their virtual reality formula to fit our perverted wants and needs.</p>"}},{"id":"0b2cdd60a8c6","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"0b2cdd60a8c6","title":"MilfVR","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"Have sex with the hottest mature women in the world on MilfVR.com Experience two-channel 3D virtual reality porn on 180 degrees so you can immerse yourself in the scenes of blowjobs with beautiful mature women porn stars and 3P.

Virtual reality takes those vicarious thrills to the next level, putting you right in the shoes and nutsacks of the porn cocks slamming away at those broads. At MilfVR, viewers can experience VR sex with the hottest cougar pornstars in the business.</p><p></p><p>MilfVR.com is only a few years old, but that’s still older than most premium websites in the still-young VR sex industry. They claim to be the world’s biggest VR MILF site, which may well be true. I’m a sucker for older broads, so I’ve been loading up the sex helmet with videos, getting ready for a tour.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Fuck the Hottest MILF Pornstars in VR</h3><p></p><p></p><p>The site is supported on all devices, and they’ve got a bunch of icons to prove it. Whether you’re jacking off with a Daydream strapped to your face, a PSVR across your eyelids, or an Oculus Rift beaming super-HD pixels directly into your corneas, you’re fucking solid.</p><p></p><p>If you’re trying to take my money, I’m more easily seduced by the screengrabs I see stretched across the front page than anything else. Rocky Emerson is taking it doggystyle, and Kylie Le Beau is licking dick, which is exactly what I fucking want in a VR sex site! You value-minded motherfuckers will be pleased to learn they offer free VR goggles to new members. It’s just a last-generation Google Cardboard, and while it’s inferior in every way to a modern VR gadget, it’s still an okay introduction to the tech.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Virtual Reality Smut for Next to Nothing</h3><p></p><p></p><p>MilfVR is affiliated with WankzVR, so you can also get the two sites bundled together for $30 a month. Even if you aren’t interested in the package deal, it’s worth noting that WankzVR is a respected VR porn site, which reflects well on MilfVR even before I log in and take a look. Check out my full review of WankzVR on MissAVDH.</p><p></p><p>The site updates with new, full-length, and exclusive VR pornos every week. I’m happy with a weekly release schedule even on 2D paysites, so I’m pretty thrilled with it on a virtual reality one. You’ve got to figure, the production process has to be a bit more elaborate, but these hard-working motherfuckers are cranking them out like Pee-Wee Herman in an adult movie theatre.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Virtual Sex with Global Porn Cougars</h3><p></p><p></p><p>There’s a video player baked into the website, but for full immersion, you’re going to want to download. Yes, dipshit, that means planning your fap sessions ahead. The pixels are literally right next to your eyeballs, so you’re going to want the tiniest ones your unit can display. Yes, that means waiting a long fucking time for the 12 gig, 2300p Oculus version. Alternately, you can squint your eyes, drink/smoke your vision fuzzy, or just ignore the pixels.</p><p></p><p>The 180-degree movie opens with Kiara joining you on a balcony wearing a leather jacket and short skirt. She’s talking some kind of spy-vs-spy setup, but I’m distracted by her body even though she’s still pretty covered up. The 3D virtual reality experience just adds a level of realism that makes a little clothed hottie standing in front of me into a boner-worthy scene.</p><p></p><p>She quickly brings you inside, bending over briefly to peer in the fridge and give you a glimpse of her own groceries. She bends over a few more times in the next couple minutes, and I get the feeling it’s all just pretense to get you all fucking hot and bothered. I really love gawking at this tight little thing in VR, so when she finally takes that jacket off, I’m dripping in my fucking pants.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Next-Level Eye Contact and Immersion</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Maybe you ain’t that romantic, though. In that case, you’re going to really appreciate when she throws that white ass in your face at the 9-minute mark, begging for a smack. She keeps making eyes at you, over the shoulder this time, feeding that growing lust.</p><p></p><p>The binaural audio enhances the slurping as we move to the blowjob sequence, further immersing you in the virtual scene. I’ve forgotten all about whatever spy setup was going on in the first few seconds, so hopefully, no Goldfinger dude comes in to take me out unawares. Kiara sucks away, rubbing her privates as that dick gets her going.</p><p></p><p>The virtual reality camera angles are done very well, avoiding common problems of the genre like weird perspective shifts, blurring, and the feeling of having your face eaten during kissing scenes. Kiara plays very well to the camera, ensuring an erotic viewing experience and a productive wank session for the viewer.</p><p></p><p>One small suggestion I’d make is to add some info on viewing positions to the video description. VR porno often requires viewers to shift from sitting to standing to lying down, but sometimes you’d rather just get your rocks off in your preferred position without having to move around. Given the long download times for these big-ass files and the logistics of scanning through a VR movie, it can be a pain in the ass looking for scenes that meet your needs.</p><p></p><p>Kiara’s movie, The Porn Identity, ends with the stud/viewer standing up. Kiara is on her back, her tiny body getting pumped with cum as she quivers as moans. Just as the two of you are catching your breath and Kiara is tasting the cum from her twat, a couple of bad guys storm the room with guns, demanding to know where the device is. There’s that spy plot we forgot about! (It’s cute as fuck watching Kiara trying not to break character and giggle at all the yelling, banging and commotion.)</p><p></p><p>It took a while to download, but The Porn Identity was well worth it. The production was well done, really immersing me in the scene with this stunning MILF. The fact that she really knew how to fuck made it a goddamn masterpiece.</p><p></p><p>After I got done fapping, I took a look through the library to see how many times I could do that before I had to watch a video twice. Holy fuck. MilfVR has around 160 movies already, and will likely have more by the time you read this.</p><p></p><p>What do you really look for in a MILF VR porn site? Hot MILFs? Check! Solid production values that make you one with the porn stud? Double-check! A big library and a regular release schedule, ensuring on-demand orgasms in virtual reality? Triple check! MilfVR.com has everything a MILF fan with a sex helmet could want, and the price is pretty fucking good. Check out the previews and see what it does for you!</p>"}},{"id":"70b3d0771e7a","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"70b3d0771e7a","title":"VRHush","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"VRHush.com virtual reality has been developing in a good direction, and what is the main driving force behind the continuous improvement of virtual reality technology?

We live in an age of technological revolution. Everyday, somebody invents a new device or string of code that changes the world and advances mankind by leaps and bounds. Humanity is currently in a new form of evolution, one that will merge man and machine, making us smarter and more connected and capable than ever before. And at the forefront of this incredible technological revolution and transcendence of humankind is … pornography. VR pornography, to be exact.</p><p></p><p>Okay, maybe VR porn isn’t exactly at the forefront of the singularity or anything. I’m willing to admit that I might have oversold it a little bit. It may even be a stretch to say that it’s the pinnacle of technology merging with adult entertainment. There are AI developers and engineers in China, for instance, who have developed working sex robots. It’s only a matter of time before those cybernetic sluts make it to the mass market. Honestly, virtual reality porn’s days might be numbered.</p><p></p><p>Then again, I could see VR porn sticking around, even in a world where every lonely guy owns a Chinese sex robot. VR technology is, after all, only getting better. And who knows how these robots are going to look (at least at first). I could see people throwing on their goggles and fucking their sex robots at the same time. Even if the sex robots are as hot as can be, guys will still want to fantasize. If you’re sex robot is a brunette, you’ll want to fuck a blonde from time to time. Well, throw on some VR porn, fuck your robot, and you’ll be good to go!</p><p></p><p>In the meantime, though, VR porn is easily the most immersive porn experience available to the masses. And, personally, I fucking love it. There’s really nothing else like it. Once you experience some high-quality VR porn with a decent headset on, there’s almost no going back to the regular 2D stuff. I mean, you do it because it isn’t exactly practical to immerse yourself in a virtual world every time you want to fap, but those sessions when you have a little time to spare are fucking great.</p><p></p><p>There are not hundreds of VR porn sites out there, but there are a few. Some are, as is the case with any porn site, much better than others, though. Of course, when critiquing a VR porn site, there are a few additional factors to keep in mind. Not only does the site have to be designed well, the girls hot, and the porn high quality, but the VR component needs to be up to snuff.</p><p></p><p>What I look for in a great VR porn site is a good variety of content (a lot of VR sites have too few videos, or they are all too similar to one another), a long list of compatible headsets, and a good use of the technology. I want videos that are shot in 360-degrees as well as 180, surround sound recording (binaural if possible), and girls that know how to interact with the 3D, VR experience (not just passively take the dick, but make eye contact with the camera, lean in, simulate kissing, etc.). So, keeping all of this in mind, why don’t we take a look at a popular site known as VRHush.com and see how it stacks up.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Immediately Impressed</h3><p></p><p></p><p>I think that is really fucking cool and some incredible site design / branding. Even if you’ve never heard of VR porn before coming to this site, you immediately know what it is and how it works thanks to the way this site is put together. But enough of the home page, damn it, let’s log in and see what’s in store for us in the members area, shall we?</p><p></p><p>Well, it shouldn’t come as much of a surprise, but the site design is still on point once inside. You’ve got a sensible, sparse menu bar at the top and, without delay, a bunch of large thumbnails to choose from and a quick way to toggle through how they are organized: Latest, Top Rated, and Popular. VR Hush is not fucking around; it’s straight to the porn, no bullshit. Respect!</p><p></p><p>If you keep scrolling down, eventually you will find a section labeled Popular Models. Here, you’ve got eight of VR Hush’s most lusted after vixens to check out. I love the way they switched the thumbnail size and shape here too. Instead of the horizontal, medium-sized thumbnails of the movies section, the site gives way to larger vertical images of the models, allowing the perfect view of their curves. Clicking on one, brings you to her profile page where you will find a full list of stats, a brief bio, and all of the VR Hush videos she appears in.</p><p></p><p>But let’s go back up to the top of the page for a moment to see how we can approach browsing this site even more. Going back up to that site menu bar I spoke of earlier, you will find a few tabs: Explore (dropdown: latest, upcoming, favorites, watch list, and top rated), Models, Female P.O.V., and 2D Movies. Not only is the entirety of this site easy to get to and user friendly, but they have every user in mind as well, not just the dude with a VR headset sitting in his mom’s basement.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>As Inclusive as it is Immersive</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Another great feature that VR Hush offers that sets it apart from its virtual reality porn competitors is the fact that they offer exclusive 2D porn as well. Most VR porn studios just stick to 3D virtual reality porn. That’s their shtick and their sticking to it. Not VR Hush, though, they understand the importance of offering something for everyone. Maybe you’re on vacation, for instance, and you didn’t want to take up valuable bag space for your clunky VR headset, with VR Hush you don’t have to go porn-less. You can enjoy one of the many high-quality traditional pornos they offer as well. It’s like they’ve thought of everything. That is the sign of a great porn site.</p><p></p><p>You can also do all of the typical premium porn site kinds of things on VR Hush. You can “like” videos, add them to your favorites, add to a watch later list, and comment on them. It doesn’t appear as if many users are taking advantage of the comments section, though. And, shit, I don’t blame them. What are you going to try and type some shit with a VR headset on? No thank you.</p><p></p><p>VR Hush is compatible with a wide range of headsets and software. Feel free to use your HTC Vive, Oculus device, Samsung Gear VR, Playstation VR, or Smartphone via Google Cardboard or some similar sort of gadget. If you don’t know what Google Cardboard is and you’ve considered VR in the past, but are on a budget, I highly suggest looking it up … it makes VR affordable for almost anyone by turning your smartphone into a VR headset. Pretty cool stuff.</p><p></p><p>All in all, I fucking love VR Hush. I’m honestly wracking my brain right now just trying to think of something to criticize and I can’t think of anything. It’s easily one of the best VR porn sites I’ve ever reviewed, and I can’t wait to be done reviewing it so that I can go back, strap on my Google Cardboard, unzip, and slip into a pornier dimension. Happy fapping, fucking incels!</p>"}},{"id":"b9b3f59495b6","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"b9b3f59495b6","title":"VRCosplayX","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"VRCosplayX.com VR porn is quickly becoming one of the most popular porn methods who would have thought that porn would have improved one day Cosplay, like VR, is committed to turning our fantasy into reality so that combines the two...","canonical":"https://theporndude.com/zh/2286/vrcosplayx","affiliate_url":"https://vrcosplayx.com/?landing=1&t=34918&aid=107859","rating":4,"siteOrder":21,"price":"free","tags":["VR"],"features":[],"categories":[{"id":"best-vr-porn-sites","collection":"categories_en"}],"screenshot_url":"https://cdn.staticstack.net/assets/img/r-thumbs/6663ca8-vrcosplayx_small.png","image_alt":"VRCosplayX, virtual reality porn site","scraped_at":"2025-10-28T21:10:43.580Z","iconSpritesheet":"default","logoIconClass":"icon201","pros":["extremely high-quality vr experiences","well-designed site","loads and loads of content","super sexy models","no ads"],"cons":["models maybe too clothed"],"detailedDescription":"<p>Let's roleplay at VR Cosplay X! In the past few years, virtual reality technology has seen a pretty big boom in sales and prominence, and it’s largely due to the porn industry. Virtual reality is one of those things that has always seemed just over the horizon, just a few years away from being mastered and mass-produced at affordable prices, with an unbelievable amount of lifelike immersion.</p><p></p><p>This seems to have been promised to us since the early 1980s in the form of sci-fi movies and a few landmarks of technological breakthroughs. Virtual reality, however, even in 2018, still has not quite hit the mark the way we all thought it would for video games and entertainment, save for what VR has done to the porn viewing experience.</p><p></p><p>A natural improvement upon the medium of point of view, or POV, porn virtual reality has made completely immersive porn an actual reality. If you have the money for the right equipment (the industry-standard VR headset, the Oculus Rift will run you about $400, and, in conjunction with a Fleshlight, you’ll be about as close to the real thing as you can get), I think it’s safe to say that VR porn is one of the best virtual reality experiences on the market today.</p><p></p><p>What VR porn, at its core, I think, aims to do is to blur the lines between fantasy and reality, to the point where one is hardly distinguishable from the other. Cosplay, another recent phenomenon of both the porn and nerd industries, seems to aim to do the same. Cosplay provides a platform for people to live out their favorite fiction in real life by dressing up as characters from fantasy, action, anime, and sci-fi movies, shoes, and books.</p><p></p><p>Cosplay porn operates off of the same premise, the only difference being that these beloved characters are fucking. It only makes sense, then, that the worlds of virtual reality porn and cosplay porn would meet … that the ultimate form of technology to blur the lines of reality and fantasy should be offered to a demographic of people who spend their free time trying to blur the lines between reality and the fantasy worlds of their favorite series.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Fantasies Cum to Life</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Given the fact that cosplay is at the heart of VR Cosplay X, nearly every video (excuse me, “VR experience”) on the site is an xxx parody. Choose between a huge number of fictional worlds to inhabit (and a huge number of fictional sluts to inhabit), all of which are super fucking sexy.</p><p></p><p>Enter the world of Space Jam and finally be able to fuck Lola Rabbit without being confused about the fact that you are attracted to a cartoon rabbit, since you are actually fucking Gabi Gold in a Toonsquad jersey and a bunny ears scrunchy (yes, she has a cute little tail above her ass). Or maybe Space Jam wasn’t really your jam growing up. Maybe Toy Story was more your thing. Well, you’re in luck as well. Inhabit Woody’s POV and fuck your soul mate, Jessie while Andy’s out of the room.</p><p></p><p>There are VR experiences on here for every single one of your fictional lusts. Fans of Tomb Raider can rejoice at the fact that they now get to fuck the most convincing Laura Croft I’ve ever seen in porn (Alyssia Kent is a bombshell and does a great fucking job, as well as a great fucking-job). Also, finally have your chance to fuck Sonya from Mortal Kombat, Ariel from The Little Mermaid, Tinker Bell, Wonder Woman, Jessica Rabbit, the Sailor Moon bitches … the list goes on and on.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>High-Quality VR Experiences</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Just click on the video to move the POV sightline wherever you like. If you are thinking about subscribing to any VR paysite, though, I would highly recommend just going all out and buying a headset as well to really get the most out of your money. I only have one complaint when it comes to the content on this site: since it is a cosplay site, the videos are, understandably, dedicated to the costumes. To the point, though, where I feel like maybe they could strip down just a little more throughout the scene. Sometimes this gets in the way of what we can see of the actual fucking. But, hey, maybe a hardcore cosplay fan wouldn’t mind this as much as I did.</p><p></p><p>VRCosplayX does offer a free pair of virtual reality goggles for you to use when you sign up for a membership. I submitted my order, but I am yet to receive them, so I can’t speak on their quality or what model they are or anything. If I had to guess, though, considering that they are just giving them out, they are probably just Google Cardboard (or something similar), which is essentially just a cardboard viewfinder with a place to hold your phone in front of your eyes.</p><p></p><p>With the requisite software, though, this is supposed to transform your smartphone into a virtual reality device. I can’t wait to get mine in the mail, so I can finally fuck Jasmine from Aladdin. Nothing better than defiling a princess!</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Great Site Design</h3><p></p><p></p><p>What’s more, VRCosplayX makes it really easy and intuitive to set up your virtual reality gear. At the very top of the home page (at least until you do set up a headset or simply click “dismiss”), there is a menu to help you set up your device, which features a list (with icons) of each of the types of VR hardware the site is compatible with.</p><p></p><p>Just click on one of them and let the site guide you through step by step instructions on how to start using your device to get fapping. Choose between Smartphone, Oculus Rift, Daydream VR, Gear VR, HTC Vive, Playstation VR, or Oculus Go, and, with hardly any delay whatsoever, start entering your favorite fantasy worlds immediately.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Respect the Game</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Although I always appreciate it when a site refuses to shove annoying fucking ads down my throat, I especially appreciate it in the context of a VR site. Since they respect the VR experience (and likely understand that it can be a little disorienting at first as it is), they don’t have ads. Thank fucking god for that, too. I cannot imagine it would be any fun at all to be lost in a fantasy VR world and then suddenly have your entire perception be taken over with an advertisement for penis enlargement pills or some shit. That would definitely take you out of it (not to mention be extremely unpleasant … if you’ve ever seen the ads I’m talking about, you know exactly why).</p><p></p><p>All in all, if you’re into cosplay, you’ll love VRCosplayX. Or, if you’re just into virtual reality porn and haven’t delved much into the world of cosplay, I think you’ll love VRCosplayX as well. In fact, even if you’re not super familiar with virtual reality or cosplay, I think you would probably enjoy VRCosplayX. It’s a great site, it’s fun, it’s a completely different experience, there are tons of really fucking sexy babes on it, no ads to worry about, and all of the videos are extremely high quality.</p><p></p><p>I say go check it out today.

I don’t know about you, but I can’t seem to watch a movie without thinking about sticking my dick inside a girl’s face, twat, and butthole. I tried to watch Joker recently and got chased out of the theater because I started touching myself every time that hot Black chick was on the screen. I’ve already had a couple of strikes, so I really can’t get arrested again. Thankfully, I just found a new site called VRconk that aims to drop movie fans into pornographic versions of their favorite wholesome flicks, as well as some titillating originals.</p><p></p><p>As the name implies, VRconk.com is a virtual reality porno website. It’s new as hell, just registered in 2018, but is already pulling a few thousand viewers every day. With VR becoming more of a household thing, more and more perverts are starting to use the 3D game helmet as a high-tech masturbation device. When people come over to play Beat Saber, I always tell them the controllers are just sticky because I drink a lot of Kool-Aid.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Porno Parodies in 3D Virtual Reality</h3><p></p><p></p><p>They’ve even got a dirty porno version of What’s Eating Gilbert Grape starring Hadley Mason, who I think is a lot hotter than Juliette Lewis or the morbidly obese lady who played Gilbert’s mom. It’s an interesting choice for a parody, since usually, porn studios will choose something people are already jerking off to.</p><p></p><p>VRconk might be new, but they got off the ground strong and hard. The movies have some of the hottest bitches in the industry getting down in ultra-realistic 3D porn scenes. I’m talking about sluts like Jasmine Grey, September Reign, Khloe Kapri, and Nia Nacci.</p><p></p><p>I took a quick look at the trailer for a 30-year-old Virgin. Richelle Ryan is a stellar MILF with some killer titties that she shoves in your virtual face before giving you a glimpse of that tight pussy. She fingers herself a little bit before giving the VR stand-in a blowjob and a tit job. The preview is only a couple minutes long, so I ended up all hard and drippy and had to get in for a real look at the full site.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>VR Porn for Cheaper Than The Traditional 2D Kind</h3><p></p><p></p><p>It goes without saying that the weekly updates at VRconk are going to be compatible with any major VR unit. Whether you’ve got an Oculus, PSVR, Vive, Daydream or something else, you’re going to be immersed in a 3D virtual world with more realism than you’ve ever seen in a traditional sex film.</p><p></p><p>Whatever VR device you’ve got, it’s definitely worth it to download the highest resolution video your device is capable of. VRconk provides a variety of formats and resolutions to ensure you get the very best experience. Streaming is available, but since the pixels are literally right up against your eyeballs, I recommend planning your spank sessions in advance. The full 6K versions of some of these flicks may take an hour to download on a typical consumer connection.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Fuck Your Digital Girlfriend (Or I Will!)</h3><p></p><p></p><p>The blonde beauty plays with herself a little bit before starting to suck the silicone dick standing in for your own member. This one doesn’t star an actual porn stud, because the entire premise is that you’re her boyfriend and she is getting you off long-distance using the magic of technology, not to mention her mouth and her cunt. It’s a good thing you bought her that VR camera and sex toy torso, huh?</p><p></p><p>I’ll admit, it’s generally kind of fucking boring to watch even the most gorgeous nymphomaniac sucking a fake dingdong. In this case, though, the virtual reality experience makes it feel very much like she’s going down on your own cock. She slurps on that thing in your lap and the sounds echo through the room, hitting your ears with that 3D binaural sound that helps immerse you even further into the scene.</p><p></p><p>About six minutes in, Lovita spins around and starts riding you in a virtual backwards cowgirl position. The movement of her ass is just fucking incredible in 3D, looking every bit like she’s bouncing that thing on your very own shaft. Her moans sound absolutely legit, and there’s no doubt as she speeds up that she’s definitely getting off as hard as you are.</p><p></p><p>She’s facing you, legs spread wide over your dick when the scene finally reaches its orgasmic conclusion. I found myself waving my hands through empty air, just trying to grab those gorgeous thighs for a field. Goddamn, virtual reality can be a legit mindfuck sometimes, but it gets you off really fucking hard.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Cure Erectile Dysfunction with 3D VR Porno</h3><p></p><p></p><p>I watched Brittany Amber in Doctor Pressure. For a split second, I thought I was about to have a legit doctor’s exam as I woke up in a doctor’s office wearing a hospital gown. Well, until Brittany walked in, that is. She’s dressed sort of like a nurse, or at least like a college babe on her way to a Halloween party dressed as a “nurse”. I’d be sure to injure myself more often if nurses really wore what amounts to a bra, tiny skirt, and stockings.</p><p></p><p>The babe says she’s going to help me with my erectile dysfunction, though by the time she says that any dysfunction has been pushed out by the monster growing in my pants. In typical medical fashion, she asks you to suck her titties before aggressively jerking your dick and wrapping those sweet lips around it.</p><p></p><p>I don’t want to spoil anything for you, but the film ends with a cumshot to Brittany’s gorgeous face as she moans and begs for it. It would be hot in two dimensions, but living it out in 3D virtual reality makes it even hotter. I challenge you to contain yourself for the full duration of the scene.</p><p></p><p>VRconk.com is a solid entry into the world of premium VR porn sites. Their weekly releases drop you into a world of depravity that was unimaginable just a decade ago. With a growing selection of both porno parodies and exclusive originals starring some really beautiful porn starlets, viewers are in store for hours of hyperrealistic masturbatory entertainment. With a price lower than your typical 2D paysite, VRconk is a killer deal on top of everything else they have to offer.</p>"}},{"id":"d90de6128a83","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"d90de6128a83","title":"VRLatina","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"Do you like Latino chicks?

Anyone who knows me knows that I fucking love Latinas. Or, to put it another way, anyone who knows me knows that I love fucking Latinas. I mean, think about it, what’s not to love? Whether it’s their lovely caramel complexion, their thick thighs, their beautifully exotic eyes, or their luscious lips, you absolutely cannot go wrong. And that’s only scratching the surface of all there is to love about Latinas.</p><p></p><p>We haven’t even begun to talk about their sexy accents or the way they move their hips. Fuck what you heard, no girls out there can move like a Latina. It’s like Shakira said, those hips don’t lie. Watching a sexy Latina dance is mesmerizing. But as we all know, she doesn’t have to be dancing to see how her hips move unlike anything else in the world.</p><p></p><p>If I had to pick to only fuck any kind of chick in the world until the day I died, I would choose Latinas. Without a doubt, hands down. Nobody fucks like a Latina. I’ve been lucky enough to fuck a few in my day, and they were the best lays of my life. The most recent Latina I fucked was from Columbia. She used to do this thing when I hit it from behind where she would wiggle her ass around while I fucked her. That shit made me muster all the endurance I had to not cum right there on the spot every time she started with that shit.</p><p></p><p>God damn, I’m getting a little hard just thinking about her. It’s a shame that she had to move back to Columbia. If she hadn’t, there’s a good chance I would be fucking her right now instead of writing this review. Just to hear her moan and say “ay, papi!” while I got deeper and deeper. I’m this close to catching a flight to Columbia right now!</p><p></p><p>Okay, maybe I won’t go that far. Although I have heard that Columbia is also home to some of the best escorts in the world, and I believe it. Plus, the dollar goes quite a long way in South America. That means you could get yourself some world-class pussy for like $50 an hour. I highly recommend a trip to Columbia if you ever have the chance.</p><p></p><p>However, in the meantime, I’m clearly going to need something to tide me over, to help fulfill my craving for Columbian culo. Well, I guess that’s what porn is for, right? To help us out in between fucks, or to bring us closer to our fantasies that we just cannot seem to make happen at the moment. And very few kinds of porn can bring us closer to our fantasies than VR porn.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Fuck the Hottest Latinas Without Even Leaving Home</h3><p></p><p></p><p>This is, of course, the biggest downfall to VR porn in general. It can be pretty fucking amazing. But, on the other hand, it can also be a pretty expensive endeavor. So expensive initially that it might almost be worth it to just get a plane ticket to Columbia and get yourself a Latina escort. Although I wouldn’t necessarily recommend buying a good set of VR goggles merely for porn viewing, if you’re also a gamer, it might be worth it.</p><p></p><p>As I said, they can be pretty expensive (between $200 and $500 a pop), so you just want to make sure you’re going to get your money’s worth. Which, unless you’re a rabid porn addict who foams at the mouth whenever he is unable to fap, buying a headset just for VR porn probably won’t be worth it. However, Google Cardboard is a cheap alternative. It might not be quite as immersive as an Oculus Rift, but it definitely gets the job done for a fraction of the price. And if the job is just to jizz to sexy Latinas in virtual reality, then I think Cardboard will probably be more than good enough.</p><p></p><p>Your virtual reality journey begins the moment you log into VRLatina.com, in the form of a giant slideshow banner promoting the studio’s latest releases. At the bottom of the banner, you will see a list of devices that VR Latina is compatible with: Gear VR, Oculus, Playstation VR, Smartphone (this would be Google Cardboard or a similar device to place your phone into), Vive, and Daydream. I’m no VR expert, but I’m pretty sure that is a comprehensive list of all the big players when it comes to the VR headsets on the market.</p><p></p><p>Keep scrolling down and you are immediately able to access the videos. VR Latina should look a little different than your typical premium pay site, in that each video is given a large feature complete with a video cover of sorts (an assortment of screenshots to the right of it) and all necessary information underneath. You can toggle how videos appear by either Top Rated or Newest.</p><p></p><p>Taking a look at VR Latina’s number one top rated video, for example, you have the scene’s cover: “Hot Tube Cum Machine” is written in a stylized font with a few still images of the movies leading lady, Isabella Angela. Below this image you will find a quick description: “Sexy model Isabella Anegla is back! This time she joins you in the hot tub for some relaxation. When things get hot, she climbs out and lets you fuck her hard on the massage bench. Sexy!” And then you have all your download options, as well as a few video stats.</p><p></p><p>“Hot Tube Cum Machine” is, to demonstrate, shot in a 180 degree view, equipped with head tracking (when you move your head in the video, the view changes with your perspective), recorded with binaural sound (you’ll hear the girls moaning through both ears just like you would in real life … when you move from the source of the sound, the audio adjusts accordingly), and shot in 3D (two cameras to replicate how a human eye actually sees things). As you can see, VR Latinas does not hold out when it comes to giving you the next best thing to actually fucking a beautiful Latina.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Decent Site Design, but Girls Section Lacking</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Each girl has maybe a one sentence bio and the only stat given is their height. This seems like a missed opportunity to me, especially in the realm of VR porn. I feel like it could only help VR users to slip into the fantasy of it all if we knew some more physical stats about the girls (her weight, tit size, hip measurements, etc.) so that when she ‘rides us,’ it makes it even easier to imagine her dimensions. It’s a basic feature that almost every other premium pay site has, sure, but I’m not losing sleep over it or anything.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Need More 360 Videos</h3><p></p><p></p><p>All in all, I like VR Latina. The chicas are sexy, the porn is good, the VR is functional and high quality (minus the lack of 360), and the site is designed well for the most part. Is it a good substitute for actually fucking a Latina? Hell no, nothing is. But will it get me through until that happens again? Yeah, for sure.</p>"}},{"id":"2146f304d38a","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"2146f304d38a","title":"GroobyVR","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"GroobyVR.com offers quality VR trans porn downloads from the people behind GroobyGirls 300 state-of-the-art virtual reality porn with new XXX releases every week!","canonical":"https://theporndude.com/zh/11159/groobyvr","affiliate_url":"https://www.groobyvr.com/tour/?nats=MTAxMTQwLjIuODMuMjExLjAuMC4wLjAuMA","rating":4,"siteOrder":24,"price":"free","tags":["VR","下载"],"features":["下载"],"categories":[{"id":"best-vr-porn-sites","collection":"categories_en"}],"screenshot_url":"https://cdn.staticstack.net/assets/img/r-thumbs/4bfd23b-groobyvr_small.png","image_alt":"GroobyVR, virtual reality porn site","scraped_at":"2025-10-28T21:11:00.757Z","iconSpritesheet":"default","logoIconClass":"icon1872","pros":["premium vr shemale movies","hot tranny pornstars","free samples","downloads included with membership","subscriptions or pay per download","around 300 scenes","weekly releases"],"cons":["pricier than most paysites"],"detailedDescription":"<p>What’s so grooby about Grooby VR? Well, if you already know the brand name, you probably already know the answer to that question. It’s easy enough to mistake it for a creative misspelling of groovy, and was used as a synonym for titties as far back as A Clockwork Orange. I used to wonder how Grooby Productions settled on the name until I finally looked at the Wiki article. Turns out, it ain’t that complicated; the company was started back in ’96 by a dude named Steven Grooby.</p><p></p><p>These days, tranny smut fans recognize the name Grooby right away. GroobyGirls has long held a top-ten slot on my big list of Premium Shemale Porn Sites, so I had high hopes for the futuristic 3D version even before I started digging in for my review. <strong>GroobyVR.com, as you’ve probably guessed by now, offers premium VR movies starring big-dicked TGirl pornstars</strong>. The joint gets a good 50,000 visitors a month, but why? Is it simple brand recognition, a cornered niche, or just world-class virtual reality filth? That’s what I aimed to find out today.</p><p></p><h3>Getting Grooby with Grooby VR</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Visually, the 2017 vintage sounds about right. It’s kind of ironic that GroobyVR.com is such a cutting-edge adult website, because I can immediately think of a dozen 2D paysites with flashier, more modern-looking tour pages. I think it’s partly because they’re trying to match the presentation of GroobyGirls, though their more traditional site is topped with the sliding, high-res images I expect from a paysite in the 21st century. Omitting this visual standard from the VR site makes it feel weirdly naked, like it’s missing something. It’s not often that I use “naked” negatively in this business.</p><p></p><p>On most paysites, the thumbnail preview images are screengrabs from the movies they’re hawking. That’s a little impractical with a VR site given the video format, so GroobyVR’s thumbnails look more like the promo graphics I expected to see at the top of the screen. They’re like little posters for X-rated movies, featuring a title, a pornstar name, and a few images of that big-dicked girl working her sexual magic.</p><p></p><p>The preview pics are a little atypical for a paysite, but they sure are enticing. Even before I’d left the front page, I’d noticed a couple things about the site. For one thing, they’re shooting with some gorgeous trannies, including a lot of the women they shoot with at GroobyGirls. Recent flicks have featured such shemale luminaries as Leticia Muller, Paige Turner, Bella Bunny and Jasmine Lotus. Their full Models index is a picture menu of pretty girls with dingdongs bigger than your own.</p><p></p><h3>Free Previews and VR Shemale Video on Demand</h3><p></p><p></p><p>I really expected a bunch of downloadable previews on Grooby VR, so I was mildly disappointed to find a limited selection of free previews. Some of the “Play” buttons just shuffle you to the signup page, though there are a fair number of 30-second trailers in there, too. They restrict downloads for most of them, but they do have a two-minute, downloadable sample so folks can make sure the flicks work with their devices. It’s compatible with every major VR unit and even the old smartphone gadgets, but it’s only two minutes long. If you were hoping to get off for free today, well, you may have to watch it a couple times.</p><p></p><p>The current freebie is a sample of the lovely Daisy Taylor in Roommate Wanted. It opens with the exotic, pixy-haired babe offering a deal to pay rent by getting down on her knees. The POV blowjob is gloriously enhanced by the VR headgear, dropping me right into the scene with Daisy at my feet. Halfway through, she whips out her own cock and starts stroking while my stand-in does the same. The last 40 seconds consists of butt fucking in different positions, getting me so hard and then cutting me off right when I really needed more.</p><p></p><p>It's worth mentioning that Grooby VR offers you a couple different ways to get their product. You can go the traditional route with a full-on membership, or just buy the scenes you want. Individual videos go for fifteen bones a pop, regardless of length. For my money and my masturbatory habits, the monthly rate is just a much better value than VOD, though your mileage may vary if you touch yourself less than I do. I am a professional, after all.</p><p></p><h3>GroobyVR by the Numbers</h3><p></p><p></p><p>GroobyVR.com disappointed me in this respect, too, because they’re bucking the trend of low-priced VR porn. The standard membership is $39.99 a month, and the discounts on longer memberships are just okay. My guess is that Grooby charges a little bit more because they’re working in a kinkier niche without a lot of competition. That’s just how it goes with fetish porn. VirtualRealTrans, on the other hand, can charge less because they’re part of a larger VR network.</p><p></p><p>That pricey ticket does get you into a hell of a show, though. Remember, GroobyVR has been doing virtual reality longer than most of the other sites out there, so they’ve had a good long minute to build up their collection. To date, there are around 300 original and exclusive shemale movies to download. Go ahead and stock up while you’re here.</p><p></p><p>On top of the extensive catalog, they’re still growing at an impressive rate. <strong>Grooby VR drops a new movie every week</strong>, which is my golden standard for any paysite. New 3D pornos come out every Thursday like clockwork, giving you something to look forward to towards the end of the week. I’m reviewing the site on a Wednesday, so I guess I’ll just have to stop by again tomorrow to see what’s up. I bet it’s something juicy, like a big, fleshy sausage!</p><p></p><p>As I type this up, the latest movie is a 25-minute fuck fest starring the beautiful and talented Leticia Muller. GroobyGirls has a long history of hiring the sexiest, sluttiest, most passable trannies in the business, and Leticia is no exception. In fact, I think I’m going to start downloading the video while I wrap up this review. As always with VR, it pays to plan your fap session ahead because of those download times.</p><p></p><p>GroobyVR.com lives up to the high standard established by the GroobyGirls brand of shemale porno, taking their sexy T-sluts and impressive production values to the world of virtual reality. They are one of the only trans-focused VR paysites out there, and they’re setting a high bar for whatever competition comes next. Previews are limited, but they show you enough to know if you’ll enjoy the full show.</p>"}},{"id":"ce9f1a46ae06","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"ce9f1a46ae06","title":"VRSpy","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"VRSpy.com is a brand new virtual reality porn site offering quality porn movies that keep you immersively long VR movies gorgeous porn star free gift","canonical":"https://theporndude.com/zh/12716/vrspy","affiliate_url":"https://www.vrspy.com?ref=ntvkmzq","rating":4,"siteOrder":25,"price":"free","tags":["免费","VR"],"features":[],"categories":[{"id":"best-vr-porn-sites","collection":"categories_en"}],"screenshot_url":"https://cdn.staticstack.net/assets/img/r-thumbs/f1e10c5-vrspy_small.png","image_alt":"VRSpy, virtual reality porn site","scraped_at":"2025-10-28T21:11:08.011Z","iconSpritesheet":"default","logoIconClass":"icon2240","pros":["premium vr porno movies","a nice variety of content","great pornstar casting","downloadable free samples","cheaper than most 2d paysites","10 videos and counting","long movies","downloads included"],"cons":["small collection size (new site)","sporadic releases"],"detailedDescription":"<p>Are you a VR Spy, or have you ever dreamed of becoming one? Virtual reality has been growing more popular every year, and we all know naked girls are one of the biggest reasons for that. I’ve always loved gawking at sluts and shaking my dick at a flat laptop screen or my phone, but those futuristic sex helmets put the boobies right up in your face. Who wouldn’t want to spy on some babes in such an intimate way?</p><p></p><p><strong>VRSpy.com is a premium porn site hawking virtual reality fuck flicks that drop you right into the scene</strong>. They’re a newer joint, launched just a few months ago, but they’ve already got a nice little stash of fully fapworthy, deeply immersive dirty movies. I just cleaned all the semen stains off my Meta Quest 2 controllers, and I’m going to try really hard not to let them get so sticky again. The better this website is, though, the harder that’s going to be for me.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Who Wants to Be a VR Spy?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>VR sites usually roll with this thumbnail format because the 3D films don’t always make for the best 2D preview pics. The images here may be a bit less explicit than the cum-drenched pics you’ll find on other tour pages, but to my eyes, they’re no less enticing. For one thing, they show off the nice range of VR porn VRSpy is selling. Despite the title, this ain’t a voyeur site. Various sexual themes are explored and assorted porn tropes are rolled out.</p><p></p><p>There’s also the matter of casting. They ain’t working with the biggest pornstars in the business, but regular internet masturbators will probably recognize a lot of these babes. <strong>They’re shooting with some truly gorgeous, truly talented models</strong>. I’ve actually banged some of these girls on MissAVDHCasting couch, like Sera Ryder, Hazel Moore, Apryl Rein, and Melody Marks. Looks like I’m in good company!</p><p></p><p>Virtual reality works best when you’re able to download the movies, as you’ve no doubt learned if you’ve tried streaming a couple pornos through your expensive goggles. VRSpy.com offers downloadable free samples, so you don’t have to settle for some pixelated bullshit shining directly in your eyeballs. Considering how many traditional paysites have ditched freebies entirely, this feels like a major perk.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Cheap Tickets and Futuristic Thrills</h3><p></p><p></p><p>I really believe porno is one of the biggest driving forces of the VR headset market, despite the more public acknowledgment of all the games available. VR porn sites are still cheaper than their traditional counterparts, and VRSpy.com will only run you about $25 a month. As I type this up, they’re offering a promo deal that drops the first month down to $15, which is about half what you’d pay for most of the big-name premium sites.</p><p></p><p>There is one small catch. Since it’s such a new site, the collection is still pretty small. As of this writing, there are just ten VR Spy movies in the library. Run times are solid as fucking hell, though, typically clocking in at around an hour, with a few examples going above and beyond.</p><p></p><p>I like to see at least one new update per week on any porn site you have to pay for. VRSpy has dropped a fresh flick for two Fridays in a row, which is a good sign. Prior to that, though, the films came out in just two batch uploads over the last few months. If you’re considering a longer membership to save a few bucks, I recommend taking a look at the recent upload dates to see if they’ve started putting out movies on a more regular schedule. Otherwise, it’s hard to justify signing up for more than a month at a time.</p><p></p><p><strong>It should go without saying that downloads are included with the membership</strong>. “Normal” porn sites don’t always include this as a standard perk anymore, but the logistics of VR demand it. I think this may change in the future as home internet connections get faster. It’s ironically a benefit of Comcast’s shitty connection speeds, which are often slower than what you’ve agreed to pay for.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Making Viewers into Pornstars</h3><p></p><p></p><p>I’m a professional masturbator, so obviously I planned ahead for this review. My only remaining dilemma was just deciding which movie to begin my official fap test with. Do I tune in for a group sex session, a pornstar GFE, some kinky ASMR or a strip poker experience that doesn’t end when everybody’s naked?</p><p></p><p>Ultimately, I couldn’t resist the allure of Macy Meadows looking both adorably cute and irresistibly sexy in the thumbnail for Girlfriends Retreat. It’s a 55-minute VR porno that puts you in the role of Macy’s lucky-ass boyfriend. The tags include Ball Licking, Blowjob, and Reverse Cowgirl, so I knew going in that I’d be having a good time.</p><p></p><p>I love how even the opening credits feel majestic beaming through a VR headset, and I was hard within seconds once Macy appeared on the screen. She’s standing in front of the seated viewer as it opens, her sweet voice talking about how grateful she is to be here with you. Wear some good headphones so you can get the full ASMR effect. Kissing is boring in 2D, but it made my skin tingle when Macy leaned in for a smooch and then started sucking “my” fingers.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Try Not to Cover Your Headset in Cum</h3><p></p><p></p><p>When I first started reviewing VR sites a few years ago, I ran into a lot of issues with bad focus and shitty camera angles. The format has evolved over time, though, and this VR Spy flick didn’t have any of those issues. To the contrary, it really looked like Macy was riding on my cock, and it felt real when she leaned in to whisper nasty shit in my ear. If I wasn’t accustomed to boning pornstars in real life, I probably would have blown my load early on.</p><p></p><p>My favorite segment was probably the dick-riding sequence about halfway through. If you’re a stoner, you owe it yourself to blaze one before this, which really ramps up the immersion. Even if you’re stone sober, though, it’s sexy as hell. No shit, I’m writing this review on a Friday afternoon, and this is probably my favorite scene of the week. I can’t wait to watch more.</p><p></p><p>VRSpy.com is still a new site with a relatively small collection. What they lack in volume, though, they make up for with the high quality and long duration of their pornos. It’s virtual reality, so it’s even more realistic than your average dirty movie, at a lower price than you’d pay for the regular stuff. If you’ve got a headset, download a few of the free samples and see how hard your boner twitches. There’s a lot more of that available in the member’s area.</p>"}},{"id":"01481247a6f8","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"01481247a6f8","title":"Baberotica VR","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"BaberoticaVR.com is a premium website with a rich collection of single and lesbian porn in immersive virtual reality.

Baberotica is solid branding on its own, an obvious portmanteau combining two words that each tickle the horny part of your brain, conjuring mental images of naked, beautiful women at their sexiest. Add a VR at the end and you know it’s going to be some next-level, futuristic shit. You won’t just be gawking at those erotic babes on a flat screen, but in a virtual environment that feels almost as real as life itself.</p><p></p><p>Yes, ladies and gentlemen, <strong>BaberoticaVR.com is hawking premium virtual reality pornos of beautiful women pleasuring themselves and their friends</strong>. I’ve already reviewed the 2D version of the site and given it high marks here at MissAVDH, with a well-earned slot among the top ten on my list of Premium Female Masturbation Porn Sites. The VR version ain’t quite as popular, likely owing to the expensive headset-owning prerequisite, but still pulls over 20,000 visits a month. That’s even more than the line around the block to visit your mom, so naturally I wanted to test it out for myself.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Going Virtual with Baberotica VR</h3><p></p><p></p><p>They are nice thumbnails, though. The format here is slightly less hardcore than you often expect from a paysite, which is kind of what I expect when I hear the word “erotica”. These movies focus on the female form, self-pleasure, and lesbians getting each other off. If you’re looking for a VR blowjob or a cum-drenched threesome, try another joint off my big list of VR Porn Sites.</p><p></p><p>BaberoticaVR has an edge over a lot of the competition in terms of content volume because they were among the first wave of VR sites to hit the web back in 2020, when gizmos like the Meta Quest (then known as Oculus) started coming into the public consciousness. Over the last few years, <strong>they’ve shot with a beautiful range of famous pornstars, rising starlets and eager amateurs</strong>. Alexis Fawx, Karma RX, and Vina Sky are a few of the known quantities I spotted, along with Lexi Luna, who I got to know quite well on MissAVDHCasting couch.</p><p></p><p>They’ve got a lot of newcomers billed with just one name, like the lovely raven-haired Martina, who appeared in a video posted just yesterday. Free samples ain’t a given on paysites anymore, but VR sites are a lot more likely to hook you up. Sure enough, <strong>these guys offer downloadable free samples</strong>, so I grabbed up the one-minute trailer for Martina’s new movie. It’s a quick montage of solo teasing and skittle diddling, Martina showing off her flexibility as she shows off her body and works herself over with her fingers and a purple toy. By the time it was over, I was ready to stimulate my own genitals, too.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>VR Porn, Traditional Porn, and Still More Porn</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Some of the big VR sites still charge less than other paysites, because the technology still hasn’t quite taken off. While Baberotica VR doesn’t offer a discount rate, they do sweeten the fuck out of the deal in another way. <strong>Membership includes access to 9 other sites as of this writing</strong>. Given how these networks tend to grow, I expect that number to get bigger with time.</p><p></p><p>Most networks really only have one particular vibe they’re selling. Sign up with TeamSkeet or RealityKings and you’ll get a fat handful of different brands, but they’re all basically just variations on the TeamSkeet or RealityKings formula. There’s nothing wrong that, because those are some obviously winning formulas, but the lineup included with Baberotica VR is a bit different. They offer a wider range of content, including Asian flicks from Japan, China and Thailand, classic white-girl porno, and a couple more VR sites.</p><p></p><p>I like to see at least one update per week on any site I’m paying for. BaberoticaVR.com usually drops a couple fresh films every week, so you’re looking at a nice handful of new movies weekly across the network. That said, the releases from any particular brand on the menu can sometimes be a little sporadic. BaberoticaVR went a couple weeks without a new update last month, but you still end up getting plenty of bang for your buck from the other joints. However you slice it up, it’s a better value than your average paysite, at least as far as volume is concerned.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Strap On Your Goggles and Get Fapping!</h3><p></p><p></p><p>That large collection size does present a minor problem for a professional masturbator like myself: where do I even begin? As much as I love to watch a beautiful woman performing all by her lonesome, I was in the mood for some lesbian action this morning. I decided to start with BaberoticaVR’s most recent girl-on-girl picture, a little something titled Naughty Lesbian Show From Alexa Mood and Mencia Francis.</p><p></p><p>Since these are VR movies, you’ll want to download your movies ahead of time if you want to get the full effect. Those pixels are going to be right up against your eyeballs, so it really is worth the wait to get the highest quality your high-tech sex helmet is capable of. You’ll want to plan ahead to account for those download times: the full 5K version is 8 gigs!</p><p></p><p>The 23-minute 3D movie opens with the two Russian babes undressing each other on the couch. The VR perspective seats the viewer right in front of the lovely ladies, right about boob level as they kneel on the cushions and grope each other. There are some light moans and heavy breathing as the action heats up, which sounds incredible with a good set of headphones. If you’re into ASMR, I highly recommend using something besides the built-in speakers on your VR gizmo.</p><p></p><p>Both women are fully naked by the five-minute mark. Alexa lays back on the couch, her moans getting louder as Mencia thoroughly cleans that well-manicured vagina with her tongue. Then they switch places, Mencia’s legs spread wide across the couch as her friend goes to town. There’s no dialog or dirty talk unless you count the sex noises. Their pussies are audibly wet, adding to the effect.</p><p></p><p>I’m an ass man, so I love the parts where those peaches are aimed at the camera. Using fingers and tongues, the babes continue to pleasure each other from behind, taking turns so everyone wins: Alexa, Menica, and whoever happens to be watching. It’s a relatively simple scene, but the immersive nature of virtual reality turns it all into a top-shelf masturbatory experience. It really does feel like beating off to a live lesbian show playing out inches from where you’re sitting.</p><p></p><p>BaberoticaVR.com has been building their stash since the earliest days of VR porn, making it one of the best values if you’re looking for a fat collection of high-tech 3D dirty movies. Throw in the other 9 sites on the network and you’ve got yourself a truly world-class library of smut for the same price you’d pay for your average one-off paysite. You can download some free samples for your headset right now, and I can’t think of a better way to gauge the quality than with a little hands-on testing.</p>"}},{"id":"e10bfc60dc64","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"e10bfc60dc64","title":"KinkVR","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"Do you want to see something perverted on KinkVR.com has virtual reality bundled SM and fetish pornographic content made by BaDoinkVR's perverted geniuses on KinkVR.com.

Let me guess: the porn you’ve been watching just ain’t cutting it lately. A whole world of sex movies available for streaming wasn’t enough for you. You needed those fuck scenes beamed right into your corneas via the magic of VR. That wasn’t even enough, so now you want to kick it up another notch. KinkVR takes the virtual reality porn formula and adds hardcore BDSM and fetish action.</p><p></p><p>KinkVR.com is only a few years old, which means it’s been around since the dawn of household VR technology. All the players in this game are still learning what works and what doesn’t, but KinkVR is actually powered by BaDoinkVR. You can read my full review of that site on MissAVDH, but the long and short of it is that they put out some damn fine VR porn. Let’s see how well they do the kinky stuff.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>What Kind of Pain Are We Talking About?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>It’s dark, which is expected from any site dealing in the freakier side of sex. Kink VR looks very much like a literal dungeon. I don’t mean the kind of dungeon where you chop into orcs with your +4 battleaxe, nerd. I mean the kind of dungeon where a pornstar gets tied up and suspended from the ceiling, where she is fucked with a dick on a stick until she starts squirting.</p><p></p><p>That particular movie is called Unbearable Pain, starring exquisite Ebony fox Nikki Darling. In the 40-minute, 5k HD scene, you get to be the captor, enjoying the little slut’s suffering. Besides the dick-stick and squirting, the scene includes edging, tease and denial, and caning.</p><p></p><p>Nikki Darling wasn’t a lucky pornstar score on KinkVR’s part. As I said, this is powered by BaDoinkVR, so they’re already working with and have access to some of the best talent in the business. They’ve got scenes like Cherie Deville getting fucked with a strap-on in a lesbian cuckolding situation, and Abella Danger bouncing on your cock while she’s suspended from the ceiling with clothespins on her tits.</p><p></p><p>Don’t get the impression KinkVR is just about women being dominated, hurt and humiliated. There are some wild femdom scenes here, too. If you’re a switch you can experience violating Daisy Ducati in Bruising Business, and then let Chanel Preston torture your cock in Not Allowed to Feel.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>The Going Rate for Virtual Bondage</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Right now, the site only has 36 videos. It’s not a great number as far as paysites go, but it’s decent when you consider there aren’t really many sources for VR BDSM. They’re consistently adding another clip every week, so members always have something to look forward to.</p><p></p><p>Membership also includes access to the BaDoink VIP Network. It’s not all exclusive virtual-reality fetish porn, but there are more than 10,000 sex videos of all types. That really rounds out the deal. When you get tired of watching chicks getting tied up and boned, you can watch chicks getting boned with their hands-free. That’s called double your pleasure.</p><p></p><p>When I checked out the site, they were offering 30% off the monthly rate. At $25, that’s cheaper than most sites. They’re also throwing in a free Google Cardboard to new users. It’s last-generation VR tech, but the price is right. It might convince you to splurge on that Oculus, or you might find out you’re easily susceptible to VR-induced nausea (which is much less common on newer gadgets).</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Tiny Latinas Punished in the Back Room</h3><p></p><p></p><p>This movie is in 5k, which they’ve only been doing a couple of months. Before that, it was a passable 4k, but you really want to max it out to get the most out of your VR device. The higher you go, the less it looks like you’re watching a slut get spanked through a screen door. Plan your wank sessions ahead and download VR movies on any site when you can; streaming works, but won’t look nearly as good until consumer Internet gets better.</p><p></p><p>Little Red Room begins with Isabella being led into the back room, where she’s asked if she knows what goes on back there. She says she’s heard there’s a lot of BDSM, choking, slapping, fucking and throat-fucking.</p><p></p><p>“I’d love to do that with my pretty little mouth,” she says at the mention of getting fucked in it. The horny little slut giggles a lot through the interview segment, but she’s all moaning nympho as soon as he starts choking her and pulling the chain attached to her nipples.</p><p></p><p>The first third of the movie is shot from a third-person VR perspective. It really feels like you’re sitting on a chair across from them, watching Isabella get masturbated to screaming orgasm. Binaural audio sounds like a bullshit, made-up feature until you actually hear how real it sounds in headphones.</p><p></p><p>When the perspective switches, you get to experience Isabella’s first-person blowjob. You grab her head and force it down on your dick over and over again, which forces a crazy “GLUG-GLUG-GLUG-GLUG” sound out of her throat. I love her very obvious excitement and enthusiasm when the actor lets her cummy, spitty face up to take a breath. He slaps her sticky cheeks, which only gets her going harder.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>All Kinds of Very Freaky Things</h3><p></p><p></p><p>KinkVR’s category list is only a few dozen deep. Some of them are standard porn genres like Teen and MILF, of course, but most naturally lean toward kink. Besides things I’ve already mentioned in the review, some of their movies contain Electrical Play, Flogging, Foot Jobs, Fucking Machines, and Punishment. It doesn’t go super-specific, but there’s enough variance to please most common types of kinksters.</p><p></p><p>My biggest complaint about the site has got to be its relatively small collection size, but that’s to be expected with any virtual reality site at this stage in the VR game. They’re putting out weekly material, and they do round out the membership with the BaDoink VIP Network access.</p><p></p><p>My other complaint is fairly trivial, but a couple of the videos have some pretty goddamn cheesy music. That’s not uncommon in porn, and generally not a big deal. It can be more of a distraction in some types of fetish movies where dialog is important. How are you going to hear that superior woman call you a worthless piece of shit if you mute the audio?</p><p></p><p>Considering their high production values, top-shelf porn talent, and the fact that they got into the VR game this early, I wouldn’t be surprised if KinkVR establishes a strong and lasting foothold in VR BDSM movies. The fetish content is obviously not for everyone, but it’s done extremely well. The price ain’t bad, either.</p>"}},{"id":"e7b91b716e80","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"e7b91b716e80","title":"Suck Me VR","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"SuckMeVR.com is a premium VR collection that goes beyond blowjob and experience immersive blowjob and sucking with beautiful European models.

The Suck Me half of the equation gives it away as something filthy and fapworthy, while the VR tacked onto the end lets you know this is going to be some of that next-level, futuristic shit that drops you right into the action. You’ve got a good virtual reality headset at your disposal, right? In this case, it’s even more important than a well-lubed fap sleeve.</p><p></p><p>That’s right, folks: <strong>SuckMeVR.com offers premium dirty movies in mind-bogglingly realistic VR</strong>. They’ve been around since 2022 and pull tens of thousands of visits per month. By the numbers, they ain’t the most popular VR site in the world, but they’ve got some major perks you won’t find just everywhere. Spoiler alert: the membership package comes with a lot more pornography than you’re probably expecting right now. Without any further ado, let me tell you all about it.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Who Sucks at Suck Me VR?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>I didn’t preorder the Quest 3, so I guess I’m now something of an aging hipster doofus rocking outdated machinery. Fortunately, my last gen device is fully capable of beaming these Suck Me VR movies directly into my eyeballs. Unlike most 2D paysites these days, you can download some free video previews, load up your device, and see just how realistic it looks and feels. Their movies go all the way up to 4K, so you’d better set some time aside to account for the downloads.</p><p></p><p>When I saw the title, I really thought SuckMeVR.com was going to be a 3D blowjob site like SwallowBay, which I’ve reviewed previously here at MissAVDH. Turns out, it’s considerably more wide-ranging than that. They’ve got a nice variety of fucking and sucking, a spread that includes titty fucks, masturbation, cosplay humping and anal creampies right out on the front page. There’s even a Foot Job category for those who love pretty tootsies—yours truly included!</p><p></p><p>SuckMeVR ain’t shooting with the most famous A-list pornstars out there, but they’ve got a sexy cast of European babes in 3D. They’re generally slimmer than American chicks, with beautiful faces and healthy sexual appetites. It’s all white girls at this point, but you’ve got your pick of blondes, brunettes and redheads. Who do you want to bang in VR today?</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Free Porn Included with Your Premium Porn</h3><p></p><p></p><p>With most networks, you have a pretty good idea of what to expect from all of their imprints and offshoots. TeamSkeet and Reality Kings come to mind; they’ve both got big-ass selections of brands, but they’re mostly selling the same basic flavors in slightly different packaging. There’s more variation among the sites included with SuckMeVR. Currently, you get 3 VR sites, a few types of Asian porn, and a nice library of the usual white-girl porno you find anywhere.</p><p></p><p>One of the major drawbacks with networks in general is that the updates can be sporadic from site to site. Suck Me VR defied my expectations, as they’ve been putting out a new VR porno every few days. Throw in the rest of the network and you’re looking at a handful of fresh videos every week. My golden standard for paysites is just one fresh drop per week, making this one a solid value for your dollar.</p><p></p><p>SuckMeVR.com currently has around a hundred virtual reality fuck flicks in their stash. It ain’t the biggest library in the world, but it’s certainly respectable, especially since they’re in a niche as tight as VR. Again, though, this is just a fraction of what’s included with the membership. The whole thing will cost you the same thirty bucks you typically pay for a singular paysite, even my own MissAVDHCasting. It’s kind of like buying your masturbatory material at Costco.</p><p></p><p>Since this is a VR site, you’ve probably already guessed that <strong>downloads are included with the standard membership package</strong>. Downloads ain’t a given anymore on 2D sites, but VR always looks best in the highest quality your gizmo is capable of. Fortunately, they’re also standard across the included sites on the network, keeping the perks old-school and letting you fill up your hard drive so you don’t get blue balls when your membership runs out.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Sucking Me in VR at Suck Me VR</h3><p></p><p></p><p>As a guy with my own cartoon-sized mascot head, I have a certain affinity for those babes in plush costumes. I decided to tune in to a 25-minute movie starring the lovely Russian Jolie Butt. The full 5K VR version is nearly 9 gigabytes, so if you’re playing along at home, make sure to start that download before it’s time to lube up and get fapping.</p><p></p><p>After a quick calibration screen and a Suck Me VR logo, the scene opens with the viewer laying in bed as Jolie peeks in the door. She makes a purring sound and giggles, looking both cute and sexy in her cat ears and funny gloves. I don’t understand the dirty talk since I don’t speak Russian, but she’s got a pretty face and breathy voice, plus the VR perspective puts her right in front of me. I often skip intros on 2D movies, but the immersion here makes the setup all the more enticing.</p><p></p><p>Jolie keeps up the chitchat and giggles as she sits down on the bed, just feet from where I’m lying. It feels intimate as hell even before she starts pawing at “my” legs and leaning in, putting her pretty face close to my own. It’s kind of a long setup, the clothes staying on for the first seven minutes, but the VR immersion keeps it interesting.</p><p></p><p>When things do start heating up, they heat up fast. Jolie pulls her bra down and starts playing with her nipples while my stand-in starts playing with himself. VR male masturbation ain’t my thing, but when Jolie joined the fun, I couldn’t look away. In fact, I think I’m going to wrap this up so I can enjoy it with two free hands instead of pausing to type every couple minutes.</p><p></p><p>On its own, SuckMeVR.com is a pretty standard entry in the VR porno niche; it’s got a nice collection size, a lovely cast of relatively unknown Euro chicks, and a solid range of sexual subgenres to keep things interesting. What bumps the membership up to the next level is the inclusion of that whole-ass network of dirty movies, offering a wider variety of material than you often expect from a network package. There are plenty of free previews, so I recommend downloading a couple to see what they do for you. If you like what you see, there’s a whole lot more inside.</p>"}},{"id":"c86f9bcc7181","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"c86f9bcc7181","title":"PornCornVR","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"PornCornVR.com launches high-quality virtual reality porn movies starring the most popular porn stars in the game updates every week with various XXX VR types","canonical":"https://theporndude.com/zh/14676/porncornvr","affiliate_url":"https://porncornvr.com/?nats=Ny4xLjIuMi4wLjAuMC4wLjA","rating":4,"siteOrder":29,"price":"free","tags":["VR"],"features":["游戏"],"categories":[{"id":"best-vr-porn-sites","collection":"categories_en"}],"screenshot_url":"https://cdn.staticstack.net/assets/img/r-thumbs/e9d9ab5-porncornvr_small.png","image_alt":"PornCornVR, virtual reality porn site","scraped_at":"2025-10-28T21:11:31.421Z","iconSpritesheet":"custom-favicon-spritesheet.png","iconPosition":"-288px -720px","iconClassName":"ctm-icon14676","logoIconClass":"icon14676","pros":["premium vr porno movies","a great variety of 3d content","famous pornstars and rising starlets","free downloadable video trailers","slightly cheaper than 2d paysites","40+ vr pornos","interactive toy-capable","fresh movies every friday"],"cons":["i’m going to be whacking off all day"],"detailedDescription":"<p>I’ve got to say it: Porn Corn VR is a weird, funky name for an adult website. It’s a title that combines adult entertainment with futuristic technology and one of the most popular cereal grains on the planet, but what the hell could it possibly all mean? Don’t worry, it’s not some kind of deep-niche food fetishism for horny fat folks. I think the oddball title is just an exercise in branding, and frankly I think it’s going to work. I’m not about to forget that catchy word salad.</p><p></p><p>Nor am I going to forget the immersive dirty movies I found within. Maize element aside, PornCornVR.com delivers exactly what you’d expect: they’re hawking <strong>premium Virtual Reality pornos that put you in the shoes of a bona fide stud</strong>. The joint’s been getting a good 40,000 visitors a month lately, and I really wanted to see what kind of corny antics they were beaming into all those headsets. Grab your 3D sex helmet and a big bottle of lube. Let’s get into it!</p><p></p><p></p><h3>A Bucket of Popcorn and a Tub of Lube</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Of course, your local multiplex ain’t showing flicks like this. The auto-playing montage at the top of the screen depicts babes getting fucked this way and that, riding and gliding in various well-lit, sparkly clean locales. The visuals are crisp and gorgeous, a good sign in 2D when the 3D version demands ultra-high resolution.</p><p></p><p>The spread of thumbnails below gets even more explicit in its depictions of blowjobs, butt sex, lesbians and orgies. Scenarios and setups are wide ranging at PornCornVR as well, covering all the usual bases from stepfamily taboo roleplaying to medical fantasies to Asian massage explorations. It’s a nice, wide spread of adult content, and you get to experience it all in VR.</p><p></p><p>I saw a ton of familiar faces, too. <strong>PornCornVR.com is shooting with beautiful, talented and famous pornstars, not to mention some lovely rising talent</strong>. Regular internet masturbators will spot familiar faces like Katie Kush, Natalie Brooks and Macy Meadows. They’ve also worked with a bunch of the chicks who’ve gotten the talk and cock treatment on MissAVDHCasting couch, like Sage Rabbit, Kimora Quinn, Kelsey Kane and Jackie Hoff. I could go on, but I’ve only got so much time!</p><p></p><p>A lot of the big-name paysites have ditched free previews, but fortunately, VR sites tend to keep it old-school in this respect. <strong>PornCorn VR offers free video trailers, and you can even download them</strong>. The high video resolutions are impressive and will look good in your headset, but damn, those 3840p files can take up a ton of space! If you’re a collector, I hope you’ve got a big hard drive.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Cheap Tickets for a Ton of VR Porn</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Content volume is fucking solid, too. As of this writing, they’ve got more than 40 movies in the catalog. Runtimes are nice and long, typically clocking in at around 50 minutes, giving the scenes plenty of time to evolve. Oh, the dirty sex that can be had in just under an hour! Honestly, I started planning out my weekend as soon as I saw the full menu of films.</p><p></p><p>For those of you who have doubled up on futuristic gizmos that attach to your body, you’ll be happy to know PornCornVR has interactive toy capabilities. About half of the current catalog has a little Interactive button that’ll sync the flick with your Handy, and I’m hoping they’ll integrate other toys soon.</p><p></p><p>Just like I do over at MissAVDHCasting, PornCornVR.com drops a fresh movie every Friday. Weekly updates are an industry standard and something I look for on any premium porn site, and I really prefer joints like this with a consistent release schedule. It gives you something to look forward to every Friday when you’re ready to kick off the weekend.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Getting Corny with PornCorn VR</h3><p></p><p></p><p>The 48-minute film opens with a quick PornCorn VR intro before Summer appears on the screen in a tight little yoga getup. Porn intros can be a bore in 2D, especially if there’s a slow buildup, but it’s a different story when it feels like the babe is literally right in front of me with her ample tits in my face. “I’m excited to have you here,” says Summer. “What do you think we should start with first?”</p><p></p><p>She’s bent over, showing off that incredible ass within the first couple minutes of the movie. She follows up the stretching with some jumping jacks, at which point her boobies make their way out of her top. Again, bouncing boobies are even better in VR because they’re jiggling right before my very eyes. I felt like I could almost put my mouth on them.</p><p></p><p>There are some nice ASMR moments with Summer whispering in your ear, so I recommend headphones if you’ve got them. “I really like anal,” she breathed into my left ear. Moments later, she graced my right ear with, “I can’t wait to suck your cock.” You can probably guess what she did with her mouth at this point.</p><p></p><p>Virtual reality porn has been around for a few years now, and those of you who’ve been dabbling this whole time have no doubt seen the format improving. PornCornVR’s movies don’t suffer any of the old issues like funky angles, nauseating movement or out-of-focus body parts. While these guys have only been putting out movies since late 2023, I’d bet money their producers have worked with VR before. Everything looks, feels and sounds fucking incredible.</p><p></p><p>My favorite moments in Stretching with Summer Hart are the doggystyle sequence, because she’s got an amazing ass, as well as the missionary bits. Missionary can sometimes look a little boring in 2D, but I love seeing Summer’s gorgeous, orgasmic face right in front of mine as those tatas jiggle around. This scene’s an all-around winner, from the talent to the set to the camerawork and editing.</p><p></p><p>PornCornVR.com might have a corny name, but they’re putting out some top-shelf VR pornography. This one’s an easy recommendation for anybody who just picked up a Meta Quest and is looking for something else to do besides swing your arms and pretend to shoot people. With PornCorn VR, you can and will shoot real live jizz, so I highly recommend having something ready to catch that mess. Virtual reality headsets are expensive, but porno for them doesn’t have to be. Check out the previews here and tell me I’m lying.</p>"}},{"id":"7c518cb5d5c4","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"7c518cb5d5c4","title":"ZexyVR","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"ZexyVR.com is an original VR striptease website since 2018. 1,000 movies have been released on the live nude charming girls. 4 new movies are added every week.

Creative misspelling is a great way to help people remember your brand, but for real, how many just roll off the tongue as smoothly as this one? It’s sexy with an accent, but make no mistake, these guys don’t owe their popularity or longevity to the name alone. Hell, with a gimmick like the one we’ll find inside, I bet they’d be doing fine even with a stupider name.</p><p></p><p>So, what exactly is ZexyVR.com selling? The VR part of the title only gives away part of the equation, so I’ll spell it out in clearer terms: these guys are hawking <strong>premium virtual reality striptease movies</strong> that drop you into a room with a beautiful woman taking her clothes off. These guys uploaded their first flick back in 2018, giving them a big head start on the VR joints popping up more recently. Let’s take a closer look and see what’s keeping the fans coming after all these years.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Putting Some Glamour in VR Stripteases</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Zexy VR ain’t shooting with the very biggest names in adult entertainment, so most of you aren’t going to recognize anybody right away. They mainly work with <strong>amateur babes and glamour models</strong>, including a ton of women with just one name, like Bianca, Chloe, Gabriella and Hope. It’s largely a collection of Euro chicks, but there’s some decent variety in there: big titted blondes, slim brunettes, a couple redheads and some curvier babes. Latina, Asian and Ebony fans might feel left out, though.</p><p></p><p>One of the big selling points here is mentioned near the top of the tour page, and man, it’s kind of a big deal. <strong>ZexyVR.com puts out four new releases every week</strong>. My golden standard is the same as the industry standard, which is one update per week, so these guys are going well above and beyond. Runtimes are on the shorter side for a paysite, including too many minute-long teases, but most releases are around 15 minutes. Altogether, it’s a more than respectable volume of fresh content.</p><p></p><p>A lot of the big-name 2D paysites have fake “Play” buttons out front that just send you to the signup page, but <strong>ZexyVR offers real video previews</strong>. You can even download them so you can see the full resolution your device is capable of. Recent releases go all the way up to 8K, which is going to look nice and crisp when beamed directly to your eyeballs.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>A Thousand VR Stripteases and Counting</h3><p></p><p></p><p>I already mentioned the four updates per week, which is going to be a major selling point. ZexyVR.com has been around long enough to build up a hell of a stash, too. As of this writing, there are around a thousand VR striptease movies. That’d be worth writing home about on a flat-screen porn site, so it’s a hell of an offering from one hawking virtual reality.</p><p></p><p>Home internet speeds have gotten better since VR headsets first started popping up, but most people are still going to get noticeably better quality if they download the movies. <strong>Zexy VR memberships include unlimited streaming and downloads</strong>, so go ahead and stock up. I recommend planning your fap sessions ahead with VR sites, just to build in some extra time for downloading.</p><p></p><p>I was pretty happy to find that ZexyVR is compatible with DeoVR, too. In case you ain’t aware, DeoVR is a VR web browser that I’m pretty sure was built primarily for watching 3D porn, no matter what wholesome story they tell you. The fact that ZexyVR supports it means you’re going to have a much easier time perusing the site and watching the movies than you would otherwise. There’s an app called Prism that works with the BadoinkVR sites, but DeoVR just has a much better feature set. Seriously, I wish all the VR sites worked with this app.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>There’s a Naked Blonde in My Room!</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Fortunately, the buxom beauty has already been in a cool 99 Zexy VR flicks. She looks smoking hot in the thumbnail for every single one of them, and I was a little torn about where to begin. Do I want a nurse’s office visit, a bikini removal, a bedroom seduction or a kitchen striptease for that domestic vibe?</p><p></p><p>I’ve always had this thing about curvy chicks in little shorts, so I couldn’t resist a Louise P feature called Hot and Bothered. It’s only 11 minutes long, but I was starting to get hot and bothered myself just looking at the thumbnail. I hit Play and the blonde appeared on the screen. “I had a lovely day in the garden,” she says in the scene’s opening seconds, “but I’m really hot now.”</p><p></p><p>The music starts up and Louise starts moving. Stripteases can be a little boring on a 2D screen, especially if you’re a jaded masturbator used to seeing the filthiest of filth on the daily. That ain’t the case in VR, though; I was immediately entranced by the sexy little chick swaying to the music and feeling her boobs right in front me. She was close enough to touch, and I had to resist the urge not to reach out. Treat it like a strip club, hands to your sides, or you might end up spoiling the illusion.</p><p></p><p>The shorts come off nearly three minutes in, revealing a beautiful, round peach of an ass. She shakes it right in front of the viewer’s face, then turns around to give us more of the front. She takes her tits out slowly, a master of the art of the tease, and then fondles them while you fantasize about doing the same.</p><p></p><p>There’s not much in the way of dialog or anything, but I like how the audio is recorded right in the room with Louise P. The music isn’t as crisp as it is in music-only striptease videos, but I found it far more immersive. You can hear Louise’s clothing and the steps of her heels, helping put you right there in the room with her. I like to wear a nice set of headphones when I watch VR porn to boost the realism, though there isn’t much ASMR in this one.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Verdict: Zexy VR Zure is Zexy</h3><p></p><p></p><p>At the end of the day, this one’s a really easy recommendation for anybody who loves stripteases and wants to watch them in virtual reality. I don’t think there’s a bigger or better collection of them anywhere. Given how long ZexyVR.com has been around and how quickly they’re putting out new content, I don’t think anybody’s going to come close anytime soon. The bang-per-buck ratio here is ridiculous, my dudes, so what are you even waiting for? You’d better start fapping now if you want to make it through the whole pile.</p>"}},{"id":"16fec6d50fff","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"16fec6d50fff","title":"WankitNowVR","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"WankItNowVR.com contains a large number of beauties in VR to encourage smooth playback and download 100 movies released every week and have free previews","canonical":"https://theporndude.com/zh/16791/wankitnowvr","affiliate_url":"https://wankitnowvr.com?nats=GC1984.3.131.316.0.0.0.0.0","rating":4,"siteOrder":31,"price":"free","tags":["免费","VR","下载"],"features":["下载"],"categories":[{"id":"best-vr-porn-sites","collection":"categories_en"}],"screenshot_url":"https://cdn.staticstack.net/assets/img/r-thumbs/d8c5098-wankitnowvr_small.png","image_alt":"WankitNowVR, virtual reality porn site","scraped_at":"2025-10-28T21:11:41.974Z","iconSpritesheet":"custom-favicon-spritesheet.png","iconPosition":"-448px -800px","iconClassName":"ctm-icon16791","logoIconClass":"icon16791","pros":["premium vr wank encouragement movies","sexy amateur chicks and small-time starlets","free downloadable video trailers","nearly 1000 movies","new movies every other day","compatible with deovr","downloads included with membership"],"cons":["some short movies","relatively softcore material"],"detailedDescription":"<p>Wank It Now VR gives pretty clear instructions right there in the title, though I’m guessing all the pretty girls will give you that self-handsy urge the moment you see them. If there is still any confusion about what to do with yourself while you’re watching, those ladies will have something to say about it. In fact, they’re going to tell you exactly what to do while you’re raging hard with a funny pair of future goggles strapped to your face.</p><p></p><p>Do you see what I’m getting at? Between my intro and the site’s title, it should be obvious: <strong>WankItNowVR.com is a premium collection of VR masturbation encouragement pornos</strong>. These guys have been putting out 3D Jerk Off Encouragement (JOE) movies since 2019, giving them a big head start within the niche, and they’re still pulling a healthy volume of traffic to this day. I’m planning on pulling something else as I make my way through the site, so without any further ado, let’s get right into it.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Sexy, Dirty-Talking Babes in VR</h3><p></p><p></p><p>I didn’t see a lot of big-name pornstars on the roster, though fans of English porno might recognize some of these chicks; I’m pretty sure I whacked off to Kacie James before, though I can’t tell you exactly where. <strong>Wank It Now VR shoots with amateur chicks and small-time starlets</strong>, which will appeal to perverts who love watching real girls next door.</p><p></p><p>And watch you can. One of the many things I love about Virtual Reality porn sites is that they always offer freebies, a rule that holds true on Wank It Now VR. <strong>You can stream or even download VR movie trailers for free</strong>. That’s right: the Play buttons on the tour page are real, which is something I wish I never had to mention.</p><p></p><p>I took in the one-minute preview for Dinner Is Served, which was just released yesterday. The scene puts me in a kitchen as the blonde Kitty Marie washes her dildo, talks dirty, and offer some encouragement. “You can watch me use this, just this one time, if you don’t tell mom that I have toys.” I wasn’t expecting the taboo family roleplay angle, which made the dildo riding even hotter. Oh, and that sexy accent? I knew I had to have more as soon as the sneak peek ended.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>How Much Encouragement Do You Need?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>I mentioned in the intro that WankItNowVR has been around since 2019. That’s like a decade ago in internet years, and it’s given them a lot of time to build up their library. As I type this up, there are nearly 1000 movies in the stash. That would be impressive even on a flat paysite, and the VR element bumps it up to another level.</p><p></p><p>My golden standard that I like to see on any premium porn site is one update per week. That’s the industry standard, and man, WankItNowVR.com goes way above and beyond. They’re putting out <strong>a new masturbation encouragement movie every other day</strong>. I love steady releases not just because they guarantee a lot of material to shake your dick at, but also because they keep giving you reasons to stop by for a wank.</p><p></p><p>Wank It Now VR is compatible with DeoVR, which I’m sure will make you happy if you’re familiar with the app. It was almost certainly designed with VR porno in mind, and that’s what everybody uses it for, but the company’s really quiet about that. It’s the best VR porn browser out there, but they don’t publish a list of compatible adult sites anywhere. Well, my horny and nerdy friends, here’s another one you can add to your personal bookmarks.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>It's Time to Wank It Now</h3><p></p><p></p><p>All in all, it was a truly beautiful spread of scenarios and an even more gorgeous smorgasbord of women. A redhead named Eve Rae caught my eye on the front page, and I clicked my way to her WankItNowVR profile page. Turns out, she’s already been in 15 movies for the brand.</p><p></p><p>To begin my fap test, I selected a 20-minute movie called Wank For Me Virgin. I could tell from the thumbnail and the little description that this one would have kind of a femdom vibe, putting some JOI in that JOE. It’s a subtle difference, but I know how some of you nerds can be about genre distinctions.</p><p></p><p>“Do you remember how we went out last week and both got really, really drunk?” Eva asks in the scene’s opening seconds. She’s wearing a little plaid skirt and a black top as she talks about your admission that you’re a virgin. She speaks sweetly while also talking some humiliating shit. “It’s not really about the size,” she says. “Some girls prefer smaller dicks.” I like how WankItNowVR.com features a variety of themes and tones among their thousand movies, giving all kinds of perverts something to get them going.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>This Is Why They Invented VR</h3><p></p><p></p><p>I’m streaming the video today because it was just a little more convenient for the review, but most consumers are going to get the best quality if they take the time to download their movies first. <strong>WankItNowVR members get unlimited downloads</strong>, so go ahead and fill up your whole Meta Quest. Asgard’s Wrath wasn’t as much fun as they claimed, anyway.</p><p></p><p>Eva starts playing with herself about 13 minutes in, by which point I’d been at it myself for about 12. It’s relatively softcore material by modern pornographic standards, but I always find that VR makes everything better. I mean, Eva was right there in the room with me, diddling her skittle in front of my very eyes. A few years ago, this is something I had to spend a lot of money on, and you wouldn’t believe how often I got my wallet stolen by a crack whore.</p><p></p><p>If you like masturbation encouragement movies and you’ve got a VR headset, you owe it to yourself to check this one out. The niche is rare enough that you’d be hard pressed to find a collection of this size even in the regular ol’ flat-screen format, as I’m sure you already know if you’re a fan. With a thousand VR movies and a new one dropping every couple days, WankItNowVR.com is a hell of a value to anyone who wants to see a beautiful woman get naked and fuck herself while telling you to do the same.</p>"}},{"id":"6b76a02d7f8d","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"6b76a02d7f8d","title":"VirtualPee","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"VirtualPee.com allows you to face-to-face with the most obscene peeing women in Europe to enjoy their peeing antics like flies with VR","canonical":"https://theporndude.com/zh/16173/virtualpee","affiliate_url":"https://virtualpee.com/?nats=MTg0LjMuNi4xMi4wLjAuMC4wLjA","rating":4,"siteOrder":32,"price":"free","tags":["VR"],"features":[],"categories":[{"id":"best-vr-porn-sites","collection":"categories_en"}],"screenshot_url":"https://cdn.staticstack.net/assets/img/r-thumbs/a224edc-virtualpee_small.png","image_alt":"VirtualPee, virtual reality porn site","scraped_at":"2025-10-28T21:11:47.760Z","iconSpritesheet":"custom-favicon-spritesheet.png","iconPosition":"-288px -784px","iconClassName":"ctm-icon16173","logoIconClass":"icon16173","pros":["a great way to enjoy pissing sluts in vr without the cleanup that follows irl watersports","the site is well-designed and looks just as aesthetic as a pissing blonde in yoga pants","as it’s a european porn site, there’s lots of quirky xxx sub-niches to be found within"],"cons":["some of the latest scenes on the site have lackluster titles and need more imagination"],"detailedDescription":"<p>Virtual Pee!

But there’s also a sizable crowd of folks who love their pussies extra wet and gold tier, so to speak. And by gold tier, I mean they like them firing out jets of hot pee.</p><p></p><p>While the world of watersports porn was once the taboo niche that was heavily associated with the German porn scene, it has since become a lot more mainstream, and a growing number of global porn studios are incorporating it into their work. Hell, in the Czech Republic, you can even find porn producers who love washing their double anal gangbangs down with copious amounts of pee!</p><p></p><p>Naturally, this has led to a growing crowd of porn fans deciding to put their money where their mouth is and incorporating peeing into their smut-fuelled lifestyle. But if you’re one of the many people considering going down this route and making your sex life as golden as an Oscar, then I have to hit you with a reality check.</p><p></p><p>As much as it’s a shit load of fun watching some hot chick unleash jets of hot golden pee all over your body and using it as lube to wank you off with, the resultant clean-up you’re faced with when that post-nut clarity is not pleasant. There’s also plenty of people who think they’ll love the world of watersports, only to find it far different than how it looks in their favorite pee pornos.</p><p></p><p>Luckily, though, I might have found the perfect solution via Virtualpee.com. This site promises to let its users enjoy all of the glorious wonders of watersports fun in a virtual setting without needing to clean up at the end. Well, aside from the fat puddle of your own cum strewn across your chest.</p><p></p><p>But can Virtualpee.com back its promises up? Let’s find out as we begin this piss-soaked porn review!</p><p></p><p></p><h3>What is Virtualpee.com?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Compatible with all major VR devices like Gear VR, Oculus, and Playstation VR, Virtualpee.com promises to put you on the frontlines of piss-soaked watersports porn and make you feel like a fly on the wall as you explore a virtual world of piss-loving whores who aren't afraid to unleash their bladders all over your face!</p><p></p><p>However, like a lot of VR porn platforms, Virtualpee.com isn’t free. The most common type of membership is a month-by-month one that costs around 30 euros, but the cheaper option is to go for an annual membership as this brings significant discounts and can work out as low as 5 euros per month.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>What’s the VR Pissing Porn Like on Virtualpee.com?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>1. Piss-Loving Female CEO Puts the Intern to the Test! - Imagine being given the chance to be a fly on the wall in the office of a female CEO as she indulges in some watersports fun with a female intern. This is what this scene brings you! It stars the divine Barbara Bieber, who is chilling in her office and strumming her clit with her dress yanked up. When the company’s new intern, Amanda Hill, sees what is happening, she decides to slide between her legs and earn some brownie points because, after all, she is the latest intern in this sought-after company! Barbara is a woman who has been at the top of the corporate chain for years, and she takes full advantage of the power she has, so she decides to put Amanda to the test by pissing in her mouth and sending rivers of her golden nectar down her tits. While she was expecting Amanda to tap out, she instead proves her watersports worth and is rewarded with the chance to return the favor and piss into her boss’ mouth before sinking into a piss-soaked masturbation session with a big fat dildo!</p><p>2. Licky Lex Adores the Taste of her own Juices! - This scene stars the divine busty blonde Licky Lex, and she has been waiting for months to film a scene for Virtual Pee. After stripping herself naked and revealing her mouth-watering body in all of its nude glory, she uses a speculum to gape out pussy before reaching for a massive bowl and placing it below her cunt. While she makes you wait for it, it’s all worth it when you see those golden rivers of pee pee flow into the bowl and fill it to the brim. But she’s not done there. Licky defines her stage name by burying her tongue in the bowl and lapping out her own juices with a smile before spitting it all down her naked body. But it’s still not enough, and she soon picks the entire bowl up and empties all of that piss over her stunning body, glazing her in a sordid selection of her own juices!</p><p>3. The Best Golden Showers are Those That are Fully Clothed! - As much as I love seeing lesbians playing with each other naked, the sight of watersports looks way better when the pee soaks into some revealing outfits the girls are wearing, and that’s precisely what you get in this scene that stars the stunning Victoria Pure and Teressa Bizarre. Starting with a passionate girl-on-girl kissing scene, things quickly escalate when Victoria yanks down her knickers, lifts her leg onto the sink, and unleashes a flood of fresh piss all over her lover’s crop top and tight-fitting yoga pants! When her bladder is drained, Victoria peels the piss-soaked outfit from Teressa’s hot body and starts tonguing her wet twat. Then, it’s Teressa’s turn to get nasty, and she goes on to wring out her pee-drenched crop top and squeezes the piss all over Victoria's body. But she’s far from done and squats over her friend and drenches her clothes with pee pee, too. The finale of this scene is glorious, and it sees these two nasty bitches sucking the pee out of Victoria's top!</p><p></p><p></p><h3>The Design of the Site</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Underneath this is an attention-grabbing introduction to the sight that reads, ‘’Taste it, touch it, feel it.’’ Behind the text is a duplicate image set of a hot European blonde spreading her pussy lips and preparing to drench your face in pee. There’s also another example of the site’s logo here, despite it being near the one in the header above.</p><p></p><p>Virtualpee.com’s homepage begins with an easy-to-read selection of text summarizing the platform's offerings and what you can expect from its content. This is followed by a studio trailer comprising its highlight content before bringing you into a horizontal selection of the latest scenes to be added to the site, which can be adjusted to top-rated, too.</p><p></p><p>Each featured scene has a featured image and a gallery of screenshots below. There’s also a title, name of the featured pornstar, and a large button inviting you to watch the full scene. However, it’s worth noting that the title and name of the featured pornstar are often exactly the same, and you won’t find many imaginative titles on the site.</p><p></p><p>As you near the bottom of Virtualpee.com’s homepage, you’ll see a set of compatible VR devices that can be used with the site, followed by an insight into the site’s portfolio of piss-loving porn models. Then, it all rounds off with a well-written call to action, reminding you of the benefits of signing up as a member of Virtualpee.com.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>What I Like Most About it</h3><p></p><p></p><p>I also like how well-designed Virtualpee.com is. The site runs as smooth as a peeing pussy and is very easy on the eye. You can explore it with ease and get a great insight into the content that awaits you once you sign up as a member. From the eye-catching logo to the latest/top-rated scene filters, this site has many subtle aspects that make it a great browsing experience.</p><p></p><p>Virtualpee.com is a European porn studio, and that means you can expect a decent selection of sordid sub-niches to be found in its content. It’s fair to say that Virtualpee.com knows how to keep you engaged. The niche of clothed watersports porn is a prime example, and I particularly loved the sight of hot sluts wringing each other’s piss-soaked clothes into each other’s mouths.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>What I Don’t Like</h3><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Suggestions I Have for Virtualpee.com</h3><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p></p><p></p><p>It’s a premium porn site that brings some of Europe’s most dedicated piss-soaked whores and brings you face-to-face with them via virtual reality. However, it could do better by adding more imaginative video titles to its latest scenes.</p>"}},{"id":"24a16b80b865","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"24a16b80b865","title":"BrainDanceVR","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"BrainDanceVR.com aka BrainDance.ai is a VRAR app that delivers realistic porn stars directly to your room you can walk around them and they can almost touch them","canonical":"https://theporndude.com/zh/18099/braindancevr","affiliate_url":"https://braindancevr.com/?utm_source=25&fpr=porndude26","rating":4,"siteOrder":33,"price":"free","tags":["VR"],"features":[],"categories":[{"id":"best-vr-porn-sites","collection":"categories_en"}],"screenshot_url":"https://cdn.staticstack.net/assets/img/r-thumbs/307867a-braindancevr_small.png","image_alt":"BrainDanceVR, virtual reality porn site","scraped_at":"2025-10-28T21:11:55.049Z","iconSpritesheet":"custom-favicon-spritesheet.png","iconPosition":"-16px -848px","iconClassName":"ctm-icon18099","logoIconClass":"icon18099","pros":["3d porn scenes in augmented reality (stills and videos)","dead simple installation on quest or pcvr","a nice free preview","gorgeous pornstars","a nice range of perversion","great dirty talk","15 memory cards and counting"],"cons":["massive file sizes","can get pricey"],"detailedDescription":"<p>I tested out Braindance VR when the app first launched, and it already felt more futuristic than the first-person Virtual Reality porno movies we’ve been seeing for a few years now.

These guys set a high bar, and just a few months later, they’ve already raised it substantially.</p><p></p><p><strong>BraindanceVR.com offers a new kind of immersive smut, letting you peek in on 3D porn scenes in augmented reality</strong>. Basically, they drop a pornstar right into your bedroom instead of the usual VR porn formula of dropping you right in a pornstar’s bedroom. The whole experience is at least a couple steps up from watching a VR striptease in passthrough mode, and as we’ll see, it just keeps getting better and better.</p><p></p><h3>Beyond Your Typical VR Porno Movies</h3><p></p><p></p><p>There’s a nice free preview so you can see exactly how it all works without having to bust out your credit card. Noobs get 5 static and 5 dynamic scenes, a far more fapworthy demo than your average Meta Store download. Adult-oriented apps are rare and low-key, like DeoVR, but I do hope Meta one day integrates an easier way for us pervs to find the good stuff. One Braindance VR is worth more than a million variations of Gorilla Tag if you ask me, but I’m just an adult with money to spend, so what do I know?</p><p></p><p>This is a good point in the review for a couple little warnings. For one thing, BraindanceVR files are fucking massive, especially for the dynamic (moving) scenes. I’m not even a huge VR gamer, but I found myself deleting content from my 128 GB Quest to make room. Big files are nothing new in VR porn, and trust me, these guys are making damn good use of that space.</p><p></p><p>Some of the big VR porn sites are still charging a few bucks less than 2D paysites like my own MissAVDHCasting, an incentive to get users to buy the hardware in the first place. BraindanceVR.com ain’t your typical VR porn site, though, and they don’t follow this tradition. It makes sense given what I assume are insane production costs, capturing 3D scenes with 165 cameras. They’ve got some deals if you buy a full “season” of content, but otherwise, their Memory Card scenes run about ten bucks a pop. It can get pricey, but you get what you pay for.</p><p></p><h3>Making My Lizard Brain Dance with VR</h3><p></p><p></p><p>The catalog is relatively small, but they’ve still managed to roll in a nice range of depravity. There are sexy fitness scenes, horny cheerleaders, dildo-sharing lesbians and even a hentai-influenced tentacle scene. All of it features a cast of beautiful pornstars like Sia Siberia, Sola Zola and Millie Morgan. They’ve even got a couple scenes with Madi Collins, who’s visited me over at MissAVDHCasting before. I’ve got my fingers crossed to see more of that blue-haired curvy cutie who does the BraindanceVR intro video.</p><p></p><p>For my first hit of BraindanceVR.com content today, I pulled up the most recent Memory Card in their static OG Collection. You can fap to these chicks in a black void, but I recommend using passthrough and putting them on your floor or bed. The ability to resize the presentation offers an unintended treat for those with a giantess or macrophile fetish, though I prefer more realistic proportions.</p><p></p><p>One of the major elements that elevates Braindance VR above typical VR porn is how you can move around the models. Keira appeared on my bed, laying on her stomach in some sexy fishnets, and she didn’t sway away weirdly as I got closer to look from different angles. The realism is insane, and they bump up the immersion with some fantastic dirty talk, driving a little scenario while giving you some sweet nothings and ASMR tingles. Keira was already flashing the goods in the second 3D memory, her breathy voice telling me, “I bet that pussy makes your cock hard.” It certainly was, even before she started putting things in it!</p><p></p><h3>Amping Up the Realism with Moving 3D Pornstars</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Demi’s scene heats up in a hurry, as she was already playing with her exposed pussy in the next Memory. The dynamic ones are optimized to look best from certain angles, though I didn’t feel like the 135-degree field of view was quite as limited as they suggest out front. There are some weird, fibrous artifacts if you’re gawking from the wrong angles, but it’s still fapworthy and immersive.</p><p></p><p>Even though the files are huge, I feel like they’re kind of a bottleneck. Future headsets with bigger storage will make for even more immersive 3D videos, but for now, you only get short loops of a few seconds each. The recorded audio is longer than the loops, so any dialog will only match the lips on the first run-through.</p><p></p><p>If you’ve ever farted around with the looping feature on the better video sites, watching your favorite moments over and over, the vibe will feel familiar. They’ve done a great job curating these little pornographic moments, so you’ve always got something great to feast your eyes on. If you’ve only got a dozen Memories on the Card, you don’t want any filler!</p><p></p><p>There were some minor glitches from time to time, but nothing that really got in the way of my Blade Runner masturbation session. Moving around a 3D model too fast sometimes resulted in some squiggles and pixels, so take it slow. I also had a little trouble getting the scenes to switch when I wanted. They seem to flip through automatically by default, jumping to the next after the audio plays, but they’ll start looping if you hit the Back button.</p><p></p><p>Having checked out Braindance VR’s newer offerings, I’m even more convinced that they’ve figured out the formula for next-generation Virtual Reality fap fodder. This is something I think we’ll see a lot more of as the technology continues to develop, but right now, BraindanceVR.com is the only place to get a peek at real 3D pornstars instead of the wobbly projections you get from other VR sites. Seriously, my dudes, if you have one of these newfangled sex helmets, you owe it to yourself to at least check out the free Memory Cards. You’re literally just a few minutes from seeing a naked sex starlet masturbating in your own home.

It would appear that only two forces drive innovation these days, war and sex. As much as we would like to think we are more, humans haven't evolved much since standing upright. We are still the same old loud, violent, and horny monkies we were from day one.</p><p></p><p>War certainly sucks balls, but at least porn is awesome. If it weren't for porn, sex wouldn't translate to technological development. Plain old fucking is good enough. The only way I could see it becoming a driving force for human advancement is if we started adding Borg-like implants to bitches pussies.</p><p></p><p>Sure, there could be some improvements made in this sector. For example, cybernetic implants could make pussies tighter, wetter, and more sensitive, but I don't see the impetus to start. It's too easy to start fucking a bitch right away. Let me rephrase that. It's too easy for men like me to start fucking a bitch right away.</p><p></p><p>On the other hand, men have much impetus to make watching porn and masturbating better. That's because the scientists that are intelligent enough to invent shit don't get pussy. They have a stake in every advancement porn makes because it directly affects their lives.</p><p></p><p>If they had a steady supply of puss being dropped in their laps, they would never lift a finger to build sex robots or VR helmets. They would be far too busy diving balls deep in other science sluts. But as it stands, science doesn't make pussies wet, so here we are.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Erection=Masturbate cuntinuously Squared</h3><p></p><p></p><p>If you haven't experienced virtual reality porn yet, you are fucking up big time. It's the best thing to hit the game since the fleshlight. VR is the closest you will ever come to fucking Riley Reid or Emily Willis. It's almost like being there.</p><p></p><p>I know what you're thinking, \"Mr. MissAVDH, I don't have the kind of money required to purchase an Occulus.\" That's just fine. Let me introduce you to Google Cardboard, the VR \"helmet\" made with just your phone and some well-placed cardboard. For the low price of $14.99, you can be the proud owner of a sticky paper 3D magic machine. You can even download the plans to build one yourself out of a generic brand cereal box.</p><p></p><p>Once you have your helmet together, head over to Pirouvr to get your hands on some world-class virtual reality porn. When you first don your helmet and stare directly into the pussy of Abella Danger, you won't know how to react. It will be far too much stimulation for your tiny brain to handle.</p><p></p><p>From an observer's perspective, it would seem that the VR experience should feel like watching a giant screen, but it's so much more than that. So much of our brain is dedicated to visual perception that your brain thinks this shit is happening. It completely throws off your sense of what's real and what's fake.</p><p></p><p><strong>Pirouvr is perfectly built to blow your mind</strong>. They have a vast collection of VR porn that will light your cock on fire. The website has an extremely modern look. It would be pretty silly to put the cutting edge of porn tech onto a garbage website with design cues from fifteen years ago.</p><p></p><p>There are two main menus ob Pirouvr. The first sits up top and includes the options Home, search bar, log in, Join now, How to watch VR, VR porn stars, VR categories, VR studios, Free porn site, and a link to your favorite resident porn addict.</p><p></p><p>The second menu is a drop-down hiding in the top left corner. It has the options Join now, Sign in, VR studios, How to watch, Porn stars, Categories, Trending, Liked videos, For women, Gay, Trans, and Blog. Pirouvr has a little something for everybody.</p><p></p><p>The rest of the front page is loaded with content that can be organized by upload date or most viewed. New content is constantly being added so that every time you visit, you can see something new.</p><p></p><p>I would describe the content collection as having a classic flavor. It is exceptionally well-produced, as is required to make great VR videos. The colors pop, the lines are sharp, and the realism is through the roof. You'll completely forget you're not actually fucking Cece Capella. Let's check out some of the content here on Pirouvr.</p><p></p><p>Nothing gets a girl's panties to drop quite like a few shots. \"Battleshots\" takes this concept to the big screen. Or should I say helmet screen? It stars the incredibly sexy duo, Alba De Silva and Sicilia.</p><p></p><p>What begins as an innocent pool party devolves into a fuck fest after a few jello shots. Once the ladies get the first couple in them, the tops come off, and from there, only one thing can happen. After the ladies spot the massive erection their male friend is rocking, they decide to do something with it—lucky him.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Choose-Your-Own-Fuckventure</h3><p></p><p></p><p>But you've probably heard about them from your more intelligent friends. Picture that concept, but with porn videos. Capital Sins allows you to choose what direction you want to take. Choose from such fantastic options as Lesbian scenes, Voyeur, Anal, Facials, Parties, The girlfriend experience, Threesomes, Orgies, and plenty of cum shots. You'll be able to watch this again and again, experiencing something new every time.</p><p></p><p>Nerds get a bad rap in high school, but we all know that one cute geek that needs her pussy reamed out. The one that's been ignored by men but grew giant tits while no one was looking. I still remember Sarah from chemistry class. Her tits used to sit on top of her desk like a paperweight.</p><p></p><p>\"Nerd Girl - Free VR Porn Video\" lets you relive those moments. Staring Angel Rush and Steve Q, the video starts with what is supposed to be a simple math lesson. Steve has been struggling in math class, and Angel was kind enough to offer her tutoring services. However, while passing differential equations is nice and all, getting your dick sucked is fare better.</p><p></p><p>It's clear that no one has been touching Angel's pussy because it's wet enough to waterboard a terrorist with. Fortunately, Steve knows just what to do with it. This bitch will never be the same now that she knows what an orgasm feels like.</p><p></p><p>No VR porn site is complete without remakes, and one of my favorites is \"Rogue Cum.\" This Star Wars-based sexual thriller will have you both on the edge of your seat and the edge of cumming.</p><p></p><p>Starring the likes of Misha Cross, Ava Koxxx, Anissa Kate, and Potro De Bilbao, this film is meticulously crafted. It features binaural sound, high def resolution, a 180-degree 3D view screen, sixty frames per second, and zero camera shaking. For my money, this shit is better than the original. I suppose the bar isn't too high for that, though.</p><p></p><p>I had to click on \"Swimming Coach - Free VR Porn Video.\" I'm not a strong swimmer and would love if a bitch like Vinna Reed showed me the way. This bitch is a petite sexy teen ready to handle anything that dick can throw at her.</p><p></p><p>The male costar is named Angelo Godshack. I only mention that because it's a badass porn name, and Angelo lives up to it by getting all up in Vienna's God shack.</p><p></p><p>Listen, you guys, it's highly unlikely you'll ever have sex. It's just not in the cards for you, but VR porn is almost as good. You'll lose yourself in a world of orgies, anal, and MILFs. The line between reality and fantasy will blur until you don't know if you're dreaming or wide awake.</p><p></p><p><strong>The website has a clean, modern design to go with its cutting-edge tech</strong>. The wide selection of videos will keep you beating off for hours at a time.</p><p></p><p>As far as problems with the site go, I only have one complaint. Because not every format fits every helmet, they should offer to filter content by VR device. This would be particularly helpful to Google Cardboard users.</p><p></p><p>VR porn is the future and might be your best hope to replace sex. So get yourself a helmet and check it out now.</p>"}},{"id":"c881531ff22e","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"c881531ff22e","title":"SexBabesVR","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"SexBabesVR.com allows you to experience the first-hand thrill of the top European porn stars in VR. 700 3D sex shorts in each category have a longer playback time for free viewing","canonical":"https://theporndude.com/zh/1879/sexbabesvr","affiliate_url":"https://sexbabesvr.com?nats=MjQuMy4xLjEuMC4wLjAuMC4w","rating":4,"siteOrder":35,"price":"free","tags":["免费","VR"],"features":[],"categories":[{"id":"best-vr-porn-sites","collection":"categories_en"}],"screenshot_url":"https://cdn.staticstack.net/assets/img/r-thumbs/5290cc4-sexbabesvr_small.png","image_alt":"SexBabesVR, virtual reality porn site","scraped_at":"2025-10-28T21:12:08.427Z","iconSpritesheet":"favicon-spritesheet.png","iconPosition":"-256px -688px","iconClassName":"icon1879","logoIconClass":"icon1879","pros":["premium vr euro porn","free preview vids","a great variety of immersive 3d action","gorgeous, talented european pornstars and amateurs","cheaper than most 2d porn sites","nearly 700 videos","5 updates per week","generous runtimes","downloads included"],"cons":["can’t download freebies","wish it had a compatible vr porn app"],"detailedDescription":"<p>There’s something about the title of this next site that makes me chuckle while also making my dick twitch. It’s the “Sex Babes” part of SexBabesVR that gets me, because it’s got kind of a silly playground ring to it, like describing your Tinder hookups as “humping”. This is a European site we’re talking about, so I wonder if there’s been some funny translation or if they just really do refer to pornstars as Sex Babes. Whatever the case, I certainly wouldn’t say no to humping some sexy Sex Babes, whether in real life or the immersive magical world of Virtual Reality.</p><p></p><p>Whether the name titillates or amuses you, you can probably guess what SexBabesVR.com is hawking. <strong>This is a premium VR Euro porn platform, promising right out front to deliver the hottest 3D smut on the continent</strong>. It’s a bold claim, but their traffic stats do tell a tale of nearly a hundred thousand perverts strapping on their headsets every month. I’ve got my Meta Quest 3 charged up, so come along with me as I get my virtual fuck on, or click through for your own peek and maybe a pull while you’re at it.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Top Euro Starlets in Nasty 3D Scenes</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Still, I like the thumbnail presentation a lot more than the VR sites that just post a fancy title card in lieu of a moving preview. Hover over a preview pic and you’ll get an animated gif, and they’ve done a fantastic job framing and focusing on the action. No shit, these are some of the best VR thumbnails I’ve seen out in the wild. You can also stream free peeks in VR, but they unfortunately don’t let cheapskates download the freebies.</p><p></p><p>The content of those trailers just might convince you to spring for the full versions. <strong>Sex Babes VR lets you experience a wide range of Euro perversion in VR</strong>, covering all the basic pornographic bases and then some. The newest releases include cock sucking and cowgirl, doggy and foot fetishism. A sidebar menu of Popular Categories offers quick links to fuck flicks tagged with keywords like MILF, Cumshot, Blonde and Brunette, and the full menu is a deeper, beautifully illustrated dive into subgenres like Foursome, Girl Orgasm, Knee Socks and Lesbian Porn.</p><p></p><p>The titular Sex Babes VR among the cast might not be as recognizable to American masturbators as some of their local counterparts, but they’re working with a stunning and talented range of European pornstars and amateurs. The top-rated girls right now include chicks like Michy Perez, Tiffany Tatum, Rebecca Volpetti and Arina Shy. I even spotted some of my costars from MissAVDHCasting, like Cassie Del Isla, Misha Cross, Cherry Kiss and Mila Perez.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Cheap Tickets and Long-Ass VR Pornos</h3><p></p><p></p><p>SexBabesVR.com was one of the first wave of VR porn sites out there, so they’ve been building their catalog since 2016. To date, they have posted nearly 700 3D Euro porno movies, a hell of a stash by any measure. I found a couple lower numbers listed, so I checked my math a couple times; I think they’re just growing so fast that their promo copy is a little outdated.</p><p></p><p>My usual golden standard by which I judge all paysites is one update per week, but these guys do a little better than that. They usually drop a new film every five days, and promise five updates per month. As I type this up, there’s a brand-new video of Layla Scarlett delivering a pizza and much more, a scenario similar to the one I explored with Addison Vodka at MissAVDHCasting.</p><p></p><p>Runtimes are really fucking generous, too, so that big stack of VR pornos add up like crazy. Most of the recent releases clock in between 50 and 70 minutes, a nice bump from the 20- to 45-minute scenes you get from most 2D paysites. I’d estimate the full duration of the whole catalog at a couple weeks, conservatively, so you’d better get to fapping if you want to make it through the whole thing.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>You’re Going to Fill Your Quest So Fast</h3><p></p><p></p><p>I’ve been kind of obsessed with Mila Perez since our own little X-rated rendezvous, so I began my official fap test with the redheaded cutie in a 50-minute movie called After Dinner. The scene drops you straight into a kitchen with Mila, scrubbing dishes together while she talks in that insanely sexy accent. I love the way VR scenes make the intro moments more worth watching than in 2D movies, and I took the opportunity to gawk at Mila’s body up and down.</p><p></p><p>My virtual stand-in splashes the girl with water, so of course she’s got to come out of her wet shirt right away. There’s some titty groping and some kissing, then she leans in and says, “You know what? You make me horny right now.” Do yourself a favor and use a decent pair of headphones instead of your built-in speakers, especially if you’re susceptible to ASMR tingles. “I think maybe you can warm me up from the inside as well.”</p><p></p><p>The little shorts come off and Mila leans against the sink to take it from behind. I got a little bit of déjà vu, remembering when she and I did a very similar thing on my couch. After a few minutes of pounding, we move to a bedroom scene where I had to adjust my real-life fapping position to match the reclining dude getting a next-level POV blowjob, followed by a footjob and a dick ride.</p><p></p><p>Everything is beautifully lit and well shot, with a few different angles along the way. There’s a lot of VR out there that uses male torso dolls and their fake dicks in lieu of real porn studs, a concession that makes 3D porno easier to film and cheaper to produce. I love that SexBabesVR uses a real dude, and you can tell from the masterful framing and camerawork that these guys have been in the VR game for nearly a decade now. That head start counts for a lot.</p><p></p><p>SexBabesVR.com is a very easy recommendation for a handful of reasons. While they don’t have the most famous pornstars in the world, they do have hundreds of the finest, most sexually talented women in all of Europe. Those video nymphos are starring in hundreds of highly immersive 3D movies in damn near every category, with better runtimes than your average dirty movie. Even at the regular paysite price of thirty bucks, the membership would be a steal, but they’re selling tickets for less than your Uber Eats lunch today. You can’t download the previews, but I bet they make your dick hard anyway.</p>"}},{"id":"c1baf7d299a3","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"c1baf7d299a3","title":"BlushEroticaVR","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"BlushEroticaVR.com offers quality VR porn free previews and VR porn games starring the sexyest BBW porn stars and sexy actresses","canonical":"https://theporndude.com/zh/23041/blusheroticavr-website-review","affiliate_url":"https://BlushEroticaVR.com/?anmk=028368289590212544i43851c1","rating":4,"siteOrder":37,"price":"free","tags":["免费","VR"],"features":["游戏"],"categories":[{"id":"best-vr-porn-sites","collection":"categories_en"}],"screenshot_url":"https://cdn.staticstack.net/assets/img/r-thumbs/95d1f_blusheroticavr-website-review_small.jpg","image_alt":"BlushEroticaVR, virtual reality porn site","scraped_at":"2025-10-28T21:12:19.862Z","iconSpritesheet":"custom-favicon-spritesheet.png","iconPosition":"-448px -960px","iconClassName":"ctm-icon23041","logoIconClass":"icon23041","pros":["premium vr bbw porno movies","big, gorgeous pornstars and curvy models","free downloadable video trailers","free downloadable vr porn game","free video previews","vod and monthly memberships","most vids are downloadable","300+ movies","a great range of material","new vr films every few days"],"cons":["some flicks are streaming/vod only"],"detailedDescription":"<p>The women of Blush Erotica VR don’t fall into the usual pornstar molds we see on pretty much every other Virtual Reality porn site, but that’s one of their biggest draws—literally! It’s not uncommon to find a “curvy” tag on a lot of paysites, but it seems like most of the time, the women in those aisles are barely any thicker or meatier than their more petite counterparts. If you’re a chubby chaser, you may have been underwhelmed by the offerings almost anywhere else, but wait till you get a load of these Big, Beautiful Women.</p><p></p><p><strong>BlushEroticaVR.com is a premium porn site full of fully full-figured women getting their fuck on in VR</strong>. They were actually among the first real wave of 3D paysites to hit the web back in 2020, and they’re still going strong. The formula here is very similar to the refined brand of smut they’re hawking on the 2D version of the site, with a few little differences I’ll get into in a minute. So, who likes some extra cushion for the pushin’?</p><p></p><p></p><h3>The Most Beautiful Bigger Babes in the Business—in VR!</h3><p></p><p></p><p>They do feature a lot of the same gorgeous women, though. They’re shooting Blush Erotica VR movies with <strong>some of the hottest BBW talent and rising curvy starlets in the business</strong>. If you’re a fan of the genre, you’ll immediately start recognizing bigger babes like Megan Daw, Bunny de la Cruz, Marilyn Mayson and Jadynn Stone. I’m personally crazy about Ember Ambrosia, aka Emerald Ambrosia or the Mistress of Magik, and this is the only place I’ve seen her in a full-on porno. Oh my fucking god, that body and that smile! She’s absolutely fucking beautiful. There are some other body types among the cast, but the whole show leans heavily towards heavier women.</p><p></p><p>You can watch and even download free video trailers of those women, a rare perk on the 2D sites but more common in VR. The previews tend to be relatively soft, saving the more explicit bits for paying customers, but you will get a sense for that intimate vibe I’ve mentioned. Anyway, who would say no to some huge, free VR titties in your face? Krystal Davis even shows off her gorgeous feet in the trailer for the latest film in the stash.</p><p></p><p>There’s also a free, downloadable BlushEroticaVR porn game. I’ve been seeing a few of these interactive experiences on some of the bigger VR sites lately, but I wasn’t expecting it on a niche platform like this one. You’ll have to sideload it on your Quest, which is still kind of a pain if you’re not a nerd, but there’s a video tutorial if you need help. It’s arguably worth the effort, though, because nothing in the official Meta Store will let you play with a BBW’s titties. Damn you, Zuck!</p><p></p><p></p><h3>The Stash is Big and Beautiful, Too</h3><p></p><p></p><p>The VOD prices vary like crazy, with some costing over a buck a minute like you’d pay for some extra-kinky fetish porn on a clip sale platform. The good news is that <strong>most of Blush Erotica VR’s videos are downloadable with the membership</strong>. I’m not sure how they decide what to include among the downloads, but members can stream everything. Streaming quality for VR has improved a lot in recent years, though most of you will still need to save your flicks beforehand for maximum quality.</p><p></p><p>The monthly ticket gets you access to a damn fine stash, with over 300 VR fuck flicks available as of this writing. Runtimes aren’t the greatest in the world but they ain’t bad, typically clocking in around 15 to 30 minutes with some shorter scenes scattered throughout. Given the overall size of the collection and the rarity of the material, I ain’t complaining.</p><p></p><p>One of the only complaints I do have about BlushErotica’s 2D site is that the updates are a little slow. That ain’t the case at all here at BlushEroticaVR.com, where they’re adding new movies every few days. I’m always looking for one update a week on traditional paysites, but these guys go well above and beyond. Considering the extra effort that goes into producing Virtual Reality, that’s really fucking impressive and very easy for masturbators to appreciate. They’d sell memberships without the high release rate, so I feel like they’re really doing fans right.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Fully Immersing in Blush Erotica VR</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Like a lot of you guys, I often skip intros in 2D movies, but the immersion here is fucking incredible. It really feels like Morgan is standing in front of me, talking directly to me and putting those voluptuous jugs right in my face. VR is inherently more intimate than shaking your dick at Pornhub, but the slow buildup here really enhances that virtual sense of connection and sensuality.</p><p></p><p>Morgan’s boobs come fully out about five minutes in, and I felt like I could reach out and grab them. It’s all a VR illusion, though, with nothing to hang onto, but I did get to watch Morgan grab them, squeeze them and squish them together. “I love having your face between my tits,” she says, and I highly recommend using a nice pair of headphones for the full experience, at Blush Erotica VR and pretty much any good VR porn site.</p><p></p><p>Morgan is fully naked by the seven-minute mark. “I brought something special for you,” she says, pulling out a bottle of baby oil before getting all greased up. “Do you like it?” I did, and I couldn’t look away. Hell, I didn’t even want to blink! “This feels so good, but you know what would feel even better? If I wrapped my tits around your cock.”</p><p></p><p>The scene is shot with male torso doll instead of the human stand-in you get with a lot of VR porno. I don’t have a strong preference for either, as each has its own benefits and drawbacks. It was easy for me to imagine that was my cock Morgan was working over, first with her hands, then with her giant boobs and her pretty mouth.</p><p></p><p>We get a beautiful cowgirl sequence for the last six minutes, Morgan riding on top, touching your chest and talking dirty. As much as I love standard POV pornos, the VR format is so much more immersive and realistic. I could almost forget I was just laying in my own bed by myself as Morgan went to town.</p><p></p><p>If you’re into bigger women and you’ve got a VR headset, there is not a single platform I would recommend before BlushEroticaVR.com. These guys have always been ahead of the curve when it comes to Virtual Reality, launching a few years before everyone else, and they’re working with some of the hottest BBW models in the business. The production values are fantastic, the vibes unique and intimate, and the ticket gets you access to a vast, diverse and rapidly growing collection. Free previews are abundant, so have at it, my horny friends.</p>"}},{"id":"c5d318a16686","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"c5d318a16686","title":"StripChat VR","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"StripChat.com is one of the most popular live broadcast websites in the world.

Virtual reality porn has been gaining a lot of steam over the last couple of years, with a number of the big studios launching their own VR brands or adding some 3D movies to their existing sites. The growing popularity of gizmos like the Oculus Quest has a lot to do with VR smut’s rise, though, to be honest, I think it might be the other way around. Do you think folks are really dropping a few hundred just to slice virtual fruit while wearing a stupid headset? Fuck no! We bought these things for sites like the one I’m gearing up to review.</p><p></p><p>With over half a billion visitors a month, StripChat.com needs little introduction. They’ve long held a high slot on my Live Sex Cam Sites list here at MissAVDH, where they’re currently in the #2 slot right below Chaturbate. To put it simply, if you’re a fan of webcam sex, you’re probably quite familiar with the site. Still, you may not yet realize <strong>&nbsp;they’ve got a growing number of live camwhores performing in immersive virtual reality</strong>. Well, technically, they’re mainly stripping, twerking, and masturbating in their bedrooms, but you’ll be experiencing it on your end via the magic of VR. Are you ready?</p><p></p><h3>The Magic of Webcams, The Wizardry of VR</h3><p></p><p></p><p>VR cameras start at just a couple of hundred bucks now, so more and more camwhores have got them at their disposal. While you might expect them on pretty much any cam site, StripChat’s status as one of the most popular cam sites in the world makes it a prime spot to catch some live VR webcam sex. At any given moment, the site has literally thousands of performers doing their thing for fapping fans around the world. A smaller site might offer a few stray geek girls broadcasting in 3D, but the pickings are naturally a lot better here.</p><p></p><p>Depending on when you visit, you can expect to find dozens of VR cam girls. I’m writing this review up on a Tuesday afternoon, shortly after lunch, and there are an even 60 camgirls to choose from. I wasn’t sure the Viagra sandwich was a good idea, but it looks like I picked a good day for the dish because I see a lot of beautiful women I’d love to shake my dick at in a virtual environment.</p><p></p><p>Nowadays, when I review a VR site, I rarely mention the devices it’s compatible with. But watching the live shows on StripChat.com isn’t quite as simple as downloading and viewing a premium VR movie, which can be done even on the shittiest devices, like the ones that basically just strap your phone to your face. <strong>This site is currently compatible with any of the Oculus devices, Samsung Gear VR, and HTC Vive</strong>.</p><p></p><p>The good news is that if you’ve got one of the supported VR headsets, watching the shows is as simple as pulling up the site in a VR browser. Besides, StripChat’s virtual reality section works without any third-party apps. Given how finicky the technology can sometimes be, that will be a major draw for pervs eager to get inside and start fapping without a bunch of frustrating setup steps.</p><p></p><h3>Choose Your Virtual Reality Camwhore</h3><p></p><p></p><p>That said, it’s a hell of a selection of babes to choose from. What kind of chicks are you into? The chances are, StripChat’s got a couple of them. There are blondes, brunettes, redheads, raven-haired gothic beauties, and a punk rocker with blue hair. I see 18+ teen bimbos and well-aged MILFs, girls next door, and sexy, stern-looking dominatrix chicks in bondage gear. Should I beat off to an Asian, a Latina, an exotic, mysteriously ethnic bombshell, or a beautiful white girl? Will it be a skinny girl, a PAWG, or a straight-up BBW?</p><p></p><p>I popped into a few free public shows to get a lay of the land. And within minutes, I’d seen a cute chubby girl chatting topless in her bed, a blonde girl with a pink Lovense vibrator dangling from her twat, and a hot Latina who was just taking off her top as I tuned in. Through the magic of VR, I was right in the room with a belly dancing cutie, a giggling masturbator, and a tatted goth chick stroking a dildo with her fishnetted feet.</p><p></p><p>With the increased immersion of VR, I swear it was even a little titillating, popping into a room where the model still had all her clothes on. I think the sexual possibilities glow brighter when they’re right in front of you in three life-size dimensions. I guess I lingered longer than I probably would have in a 2D public cam show, hoping to see those tops come off or those panties drop.</p><p>I’ve said this a million times before, but the busy webcam sites like StripChat are perfect for cheapskates looking to see live T&amp;A without paying anything. The same holds true in the site’s VR section, where multiple women are baring all in totally free virtual reality shows. You’re almost guaranteed to see some free fun if you’ve got a nice little crowd of perverts already gathered around to watch the show.</p><p></p><p>It’s worth noting that the models aren’t performing in VR only. They’re also broadcasting in traditional 2D. There are some minor logistical issues with the setup. Since most of the other viewers will likely be watching the flat-screen version, the models might be performing toward those viewers. I saw a Reddit post with some broke-ass neckbeard complaining about the issue, but as a longtime fan of webcam sex, the solution seems really fucking obvious: if the girl isn’t paying enough attention to you, tip her! It isn’t rocket science, you bums!</p><p></p><h3>Chatting Up 3D Girls in VR Bedrooms</h3><p></p><p></p><p>I was initially worried about the logistics of initiating a private VR show and chatting with the girl, thinking I’d have to pop off my headset to type in some words. Well, they already thought of that and figured out a solution: <strong>you can chat with the models using the mic in your VR headset</strong>. They’re just inching us closer and closer to the real thing. Next, I will need an integrated electronic dick massager and something to transmit the smell of wet pussy over the internet.</p><p></p><p>The absolute ease of accessibility will be one of the biggest draws to StripChat.com’s virtual reality cam shows. Their whole VR setup has undergone a couple of significant overhauls since its inception, and they’re nailing the entire thing as far as giving cam fans everything they could want in a VR site. There’s no real setup to speak of to use the facilities here, and they’ve got more VR camwhores every time I visit the site. If you’ve got a compatible headset and you’re into webcam sex, you’re going to fucking love this.</p>"}}]

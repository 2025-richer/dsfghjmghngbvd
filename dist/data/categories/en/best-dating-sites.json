Just because a goal has a goalie doesn’t mean you can’t score. That’s the kind of attitude you need going into this next dating site. It’s all about discretion and secret hookups with horny women who aren’t satisfied with their relationships. That’s where you come in. It’s time to get out there and give these lonely babes the premium pounding that their lame-ass boyfriends or husbands aren’t providing. But this site isn’t just for you relationship destroyers out there. This platform is also great for single people to meet up more discretely. Tired of your coworkers or friends stumbling across your Tinder profile? Then this site is also for you!</p><p></p><p>Ashleymadison.com is a discrete dating site made for you married people out there who aren’t happy with just one partner. With a slogan like “Life is short. Have an affair” you know exactly what this site is all about. And a fuck ton of people use this site. They bring in an impressive 13 million views every month. And Ashley Madison has been around since 2001. That’s nearly a decade of morally ambiguous matchmaking experience under their belt.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Free to Sign up and View Profiles</h3><p></p><p></p><p>One of those details is a profile picture. Don’t worry though, they have some cool ways to keep your identity secret. One option is blurring your photo and only revealing it people that you want to match with. You can also hide details with masks and other photo edits. But it’s recommended that you have some sort of picture. Other simple details you can include are things like height, weight, language, and smoking habits. But you can also add what kind of relationship you’re looking for. Like if you want something short term, long term, just cybersex, or if you’re open to anything.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Plenty of Ways to Filter and Find the Right Hookup</h3><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Fuck Memberships. Their Unique Credit System Lets You Control How You Spend Your Money.</h3><p></p><p></p><p>But you can view profiles for free. There’s none of that “pay to view photos” shit or anything like that. I always hate it when dating sites do that. They only time you’ll see that here is when that person personally decides to lock certain photos, otherwise, it’s free game.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>In Depth Profile that Are Free to View and an Awesome Feature for Travelers</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Ashleymadison.com has a neat travel feature that lets you message up to 30 potential hookups in a city you plan to visit soon. It’s perfect for getting a little break while you’re away from your family on a business trip. Whoever said you couldn’t mix business and pleasure was dead wrong.</p><p></p><p>Man, it’s really fucking easy to have an affair this way. Though I don’t know why you guys out there tie yourself down to one chick anyway. The real fun is having the ability to get with any smoking piece of ass you want. But this site works for those kinds of hookups too. Lots of the people I saw on here were single and down to fuck. Plus, everyone here is down to do something. You can’t say the same about all the prude bitches on Tinder who are “looking for friends.” Yeah, bullshit. Here you can be sure that the chick you’re going to message wants to get fucked just as much as you want to fuck.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Awesome Mobile Site Makes Cheating Even Easier!</h3><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>MissAVDH’s Favorite Features</h3><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>MissAVDH’s Suggestions</h3><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>MissAVDH’s Final Thoughts</h3><p></p>"}},{"id":"81a9b239f72e","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"81a9b239f72e","title":"Fling.com","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"Fling.com Have you been looking for a perfect dating site?

No charge! No card needed! Tons of hot sluts ready to fuck in your area!” How many times have you been fooled by that old trick, huh? Oh, who are we kidding? We both know you still click on these ads every once in a while, on the sheer hope that maybe, just maybe, one of them will be real one day.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, though, this kind of site doesn’t seem to exist. If it seems too good to be true, hell, it probably is. But I still have hope that one of these days someone will figure out a way to come out with a completely free, real, sexy hookup site. Not like Tinder, either, something that is very explicitly for fucking. I don’t like to have to play all the games on apps like Tinder and Bumble and Plenty of Shit. It’s fucking annoying. Sure, Tinder has a reputation for facilitating a fuck ton of hookups, and it definitely has worked for me before. But it still requires way more work than I would have preferred to put into it! You still, most of the time, have to jump through hoops, play the game, before pussy is ever even close to being on the table. And the table is always a good place for pussy to be!</p><p></p><p>It would be nice, however, if there could be just one site that is unabashedly for casual sex and nothing else. A site that commits to that mission – that mission to help you spew your emission – and is jam-packed with sexy broads who are horny and loose and ready to party. Somebody, please tell me if they find that site out there. I’ve heard of Feeld before, it’s an app, but I think it’s mostly for couples and swingers. Plus, it isn’t very popular, so I can’t imagine the selection would be stellar.</p><p></p><p>And then I came across a site called Fling. Actually, there’s a really good chance that you’ve probably come across it at one point or another, too, whether or not you were even aware of it. It’s one of the more heavily advertised of all the “hook up” sites. It’s been placed on most of the popular porn tube sites, and it claims to be the real deal. Well, let’s take a look, shall we, and figure out, once and for all, if Fling is, in fact, the right site to help you find a hot fling of your own.</p><p></p><p>From the moment you land on Fling’s home page, it appears to be the real deal. It looks pretty legit. You are greeted with a quick questionnaire regarding your gender and what you’re looking for. You’ll also be asked to provide your birth year (to confirm that you are over 18, of course). And they will be asking for your email address as well. Alright, that’s fine.</p><p></p><p>This is precisely why I made a spam email address, to begin with. I highly recommend you do the same. Any time you want to sign up for a site that you are unsure of or that you already know is going to decimate your inbox with undesired emails, have an alternative email address to give them, so you can go on unbothered in your daily life, and only check the backup when you absolutely need to, to sign up for sites like this and whatnot.</p><p></p><p>Once you’re registered, you will be prompted even further to fill out the remainder of your profile. Fling will ask you a few questions about what you’re looking for, the duration of the kind of fling you want, if and for how long you are willing to travel, the frequency of hookups you desire, how kinky you are, and a few basic physical trait questions (hair, eye color, etc.). Then, finally, once you get all of those questions answered, you will have access to the site.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Where the Fuck do I Click?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Firstly, there’s a carousel of chicks cascading by at the top of the page. Then, down below you’ll find two adjacent sections: “members who stream” (I’m assuming that means cam stream?) and “meet now in [your state].” Right above those, packed into the chaos is “who’s online now” and some game called “who’s cute” where you can rate users.</p><p></p><p>Below all that, it gets even messier. You’ll find a box titled “who’s viewed me” next to “my friends” and then popular member photos, popular member videos, all of which blend right into an ad for Cam Soda. Oh, and I completely forgot to mention the site menu bar. Up at the top of the page, you can choose between Home, Search, Online Now, Chat, Trending Now, Live Girls, and (of course) Upgrade Now. It’s like they tried to throw every single thing they’ve ever seen on a website before onto a single page. Just way too fucking much going on.</p><p></p><p>I mean, I’m sure you’d probably get used to this after a while, right? But at the same time, who the fuck wants to put in the time to get used to awful site design when it could just be avoided altogether by the people behind this site?</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Good Search and Advanced Search Functions</h3><p></p><p></p><p>The advanced search feature is even more exciting, because it allows you to narrow down the playing field even further, helping you find the perfect sexy slut for you. Specify eye color, hair color, body type, race, religious preferences, languages spoken, marital status, income, profession, and whether or not she’s into threesomes, group sex, friends with benefits, online flirting, in-person meetups, or relationships. It’s a fairly impressive advanced search. Now I’ll finally be able to find my green-eyed, blue-haired Asian Satanic midget who speaks Swahili, is in a lesbian marriage, makes a 6-figure salary, and is looking for a side piece … It’s about damn time!</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Nothing in Life is Free…</h3><p></p><p></p><p>A lot of sites have bots and shit meant to lure you into a subscription, but then once they get your money, the messages and profile views significantly fall off. I can’t say either way with Fling, but let’s just assume that they aren’t looking to screw you over. I try to see the best in people when possible. Anyway, like I was saying, it’s a fair price at $6.95/month if you commit to a full year. That’s about half the price of a Tinder upgrade. One month of Gold membership, however, is $34.95, or you can get a week for $9.95 or 6 months for $11.65 per.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, outside of the site design and potential features, there isn’t a whole lot that I can tell you about Fling. I mean, I’m sure as hell not paying money for a site like this. I don’t need any help getting pussy! But if you do (and a lot of you dudes out there definitely do), it might be worth trying Fling (often misspelled as \"flung\" and \"flings\") out. Maybe even just for the 95-cent 2-day trial period. Hey, why the fuck not, right?</p><p></p><p>Oh, one more life pro tip before I go: I like to keep a little bit of money on a Visa gift card to sign up for any porn-related site that charges on the internet. Just because, hell, you never know!

There are plenty of dating sites out there, some of which even claim to be hookup friendly; others have just built a reputation for being so. Not every dating site is ideal, though, when it comes to trying to get laid online. So, how are you supposed to know which ones are legit for your dick and which ones are shit? Well, let’s break down a few of the more popular ones in terms of whether or not you are likely to have any luck using them in order to get a little bit of a better idea.</p><p></p><p>The first dating site I want to take a look at is OkCupid. I’m sure you’ve heard of it at some point or another. It seems to work alright in terms of a site meant to get dates. But how much hookup potential does it have, if any? Well, “hookup” is an option that the site lets you put on your profile as an answer to the question “what are you looking for?” So, that’s a good start. But a more important question to ask when weighing whether or not a dating site will get you laid is, how many girls are on the site looking to hook up?</p><p></p><p>And, depending on where you live (the size of your city), there are a few. More often than not, though, at least in my experience, it seems as if the girls who say they are looking to hook up are not, in reality, looking for that. For the most part, OkCupid is a good site to go out on dates, but as far as actually getting laid goes, I’ve had much better luck on other apps.</p><p></p><p>One app that I’ve had more luck on than OkCupid is Tinder. Ah, the notorious Tinder. It has gained quite a reputation among the online dating apps for leading to more hookups than others, but is it a reliable source? Well, honestly, much like any other dating site or app, it really depends on whether or not you have game. There are a few approaches to getting laid on Tinder. Some guys like to be straightforward, messaging as many matches as they can “wanna fuck?” But this is not a foolproof method.</p><p></p><p>Lots of girls, even the ones just looking to fuck, still appreciate the thrill of the chase. Or, more accurately, they appreciate the thrill of being chased. So, all though you will probably have better luck getting your dick wet on Tinder over OkCupid, you’re going to have to know how to navigate all of the pretenses that come with being on a dating site; you’ll likely have to take a lot of swings, in other words, before you finally hit a home run.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>The Facebook of Casual Sex</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Just like with any other social media or dating site, though, you have to already have two things in order to really get the most out of this site. And those things are A.) you have to be attractive, and B.) you have to have some semblance of game. Don’t sign up for Fuckbook expecting pussy to magically rain down from the heavens. It is still going to take effort. And if you’re an ugly ass motherfucker, ain’t no website going to change that fact. And no amount of game is going to make you any more fuckable if you look like you got hit with a Mack truck.</p><p></p><p>Fuckbook seems to at least give you a shot, though, so long as you are average looking, have decent pics, and can hold a semi-decent conversation. As far as the girls on Fuckbook go, there are some super sexy sluts to try your luck with, sure, but there are just as many ugly skanks as well. Although there are significantly fewer fake accounts, scammers, and spambots to contend with on Fuckbook than there are on similar sites, you are still going to run into some once in a while, so you’ll need to be on the lookout. Fuckbook, though, is generally good about keeping you up to date with scam alerts to help keep you protected.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Great Social Media Site Design</h3><p></p><p></p><p>And above your news feed, you also have a space to craft your own posts. Feel free to share your own pics, write a blog post, or just express yourself via text. This will allow other users on the site to interact with your content. The more attention a post gets, the more likely others are going to see it. But, hopefully, you have chicks browsing in their areas who will come across your profile at one point or another.</p><p></p><p>Above the news feed is a site menu bar. It is simple and easy to use, making for an extremely user-friendly web experience. Click on a grid button to switch to a full-on menu, which takes over the left side of the page (dimming the page behind it). From here, you can quickly jump to your feed (“Overview”), search users, view your matches, open Fuckbook’s live cam page (separate membership needed), “Find Your Love” brings you to a partner site, Flirt (more relationship-oriented), upgrade your account, view your messages, view friend requests, see who has looked at your profile, or view/edit your profile and account information.</p><p></p><p>Aside from this sleekly designed and incredibly convenient site navigation menu, you can also quickly conduct a search, view matches, and see notifications from other tabs in the menu bar. To the right of whatever page that you happen to be on, you will find a list of members to message. The list is automatically curated by your matches (based on location mostly) and if any of your friends are online, they will appear at the top of the list.</p><p></p><p>To start chatting up a girl, just click on her name and a separate message box will open up to the left of the list. The whole messenger setup is, appropriately given the name of the site, nearly an exact replica of the messenger on Facebook.</p><p></p><p>One quality control measure that Fuckbook puts in place to set it apart from other similar sites out there is that they utilize a karma system. Basically, based on how much a member interacts with the site, she will be given a rating of bronze, silver, or gold. If she never does anything, she has a low rating … you get the picture. So, perhaps this can be a way to weed out the duds or spammers to get straight to the hot and horny chicks near you.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Does Fuckbook Actually Work?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>So, honestly, I don’t entirely know what to make of Fuckbook. I’ll probably come back again and see if maybe I just logged in at a bad time. But, more importantly, I am interested in seeing whether or not the girls I had fun with ever log back in and, if they do, they continue to chat with me. Should I never see them again, that will make me suspect that they were bots. Only time will tell with this one.</p><p></p><p>All in all, Fuckbook is a really well designed, and well thought out social media/dating site that cuts through the bullshit and lets you get down to the real reason you would ever be on a dating site, to begin with: to fuck! The verdict is still out on whether or not it is an effective way to get laid, but I will update you if anything develops.</p>"}},{"id":"9613acc4dc6b","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"9613acc4dc6b","title":"SwingersDateClub","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"SDC.com aka Swingers Date Club Have you ever thought you might be watching too much pornography.

Not every website that you visit in order to feed your endlessly lustful appetites has to be an orgiastic smorgasbord of escorts and porn and all-out fuck fests with anal gaping and deepthroating and double penetration galore. Consider for a moment that you might take some time out of your day to become a little more enlightened about sexuality. Have you ever stopped to consider that possibility? That you might educate yourself on the nature of sexuality, self-reflect on the nature of your own sexuality, and take into consideration the sexualities of others?</p><p></p><p>No? Well, I’m not surprised, seeing as idly scanning your eyes over the words of this review is likely to be the most reading that you’ll do all month. But you should consider doing it more. Reading is how people get smarter, have good ideas, learn new things, become more interesting. And do you know what all of those qualities add up to eventually? Getting laid. That’s right … don’t let the current ‘leader’ of the free world trick you into thinking otherwise because he’s stupid as a sack of potatoes and managed to fuck a porn star.</p><p></p><p>Don’t get it twisted, Donald Trump only fucked a porn star because he had enough money to, not because Stormy Daniels actually had any interest in letting him slosh his micro penis around inside of her for two to three minutes. And it seems like everyone else this walking cloud of Cheetos dust come to life has ever fucked he either ordered from Russia (his wife) or grabbed by the pussy.</p><p></p><p>See, talking about sex can be fun without having to be just fapping to flicks of fucking all day long. Maybe it’s about time you gave your dick a well-deserved break and stimulated your mind for a change – you know, that other place that your blood is supposed to be flowing when it’s not constantly being rerouted to your dick because you are trying to fill a void in yourself with constant streams of porn. If you keep making yourself feel good all the time, how could you ever feel sad! That’s the spirit, ol’ sport …</p><p></p><p>If you are down for something a little more mentally satisfying, however, I have just the site for you. Allow me to introduce you to SDC.com. Your first question, I’m sure, is probably, ‘hey, MissAVDH, what the fuck does SDC stand for anyway?’ Well, thank you for asking! That’s exactly what I was about to get to. SDC stands for Seek, Discover, Create. Or, to flesh that out a bit, as their motto goes: “Seek yourself, discover together, and create moments.” Now, you may or may not be thinking to yourself, ‘well, fuck, that sounds pretty gay.’ And if you are thinking that then this site is probably not going to be for you. And you probably are one of those people I was talking about earlier who doesn’t read anything outside of porn site reviews. And you should probably strongly consider tripping on acid or eating some mushrooms someday. Or drink some ayahuasca or go on a silent meditation retreat to Tibet or something, I don’t fucking know, just do something to expand your god damned mind a little!</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Not Quite a Porn Site, but Important Nonetheless</h3><p></p><p></p><p>It’s not all about sex on SDC, though. There is, for example, an entire section of the site dedicated to travel. Granted, it seems as if the travel pieces are in particularly romantic places, but still. The information is there, what you do with it is up to you. Maybe you could use their travel suggestions to take your partner on a romantic getaway. That usually works to help couples get through a dry spell together. Nothing gets a pussy wetter than the words, ‘baby, let’s go to Paris this summer.’ Word to the wise.</p><p></p><p>The site itself is beautifully designed. It’s nice and minimalistic, and it has a very professional aesthetic to it. Honestly, it looks more like a really well-done news or lifestyle publication’s website than anything you’d expect to find in the world of adult entertainment. At the top of the page, you’ve got a sleek and intuitive site menu bar, allowing you easy access to all of the different sections of the site. When you place your cursor over one of the sections, an elegant mini dropdown menu does its thing below it so that you can explore some articles and general topics of that section without ever leaving the page. Just fucking wonderful design. Here, you can browse the site by clicking on Group, Sex, Kink, Erotic, LGBTQ+, Relationship, Health, Media, Travel, or More.</p><p></p><p>Below the site menu bar, you’ll find an assortment of articles, all sectioned out by category. Each article comes with a relevant thumbnail image for it, and some of them have a short introduction or synopsis of the article underneath it. The selections are of various sizes, too, giving the site that trendy collage feel that so many lifestyle and news sites are going for these days, further adding to the legitimacy and professionalism of the site’s design.</p><p></p><p>SDC also has videos. But don’t get too excited. They won’t be anything that you can fap or flick the bean to. Unless, of course, you get off on educational Q&amp;As or informative, educational videos. In which case, shine on, you crazy diamond. In terms of non-text media, the site also offers up a breadth of podcasts for you to throw on while you work out or commute to work or maybe while you’re strolling the town for some strange … I don’t know what the fuck it is you do in your free time.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Casting Sexuality in a New Light</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Morality appears to be a big concern of SDC’s writers. As it should be. We can talk all day long about how great it is, for example, that polyamory is becoming more socially acceptable than it ever has been in the past, but if we don’t talk about the ethical implications of such a lifestyle, then we are doing a great disservice to ourselves and others who are thinking about trying something like that out.</p><p></p><p>SDC understands that what we all want, at the end of the day, is to be happy, satisfied, and fulfilled – sexually, mentally, and emotionally. And I think that SDC understands, much more than many other publications out there today, that these three categories (sexual, mental, emotional) are not as segregated or compartmentalized as we like to pretend the to be. That they are, in fact, deeply interconnected and affected by one another. And, so, SDC has created an online publication to reflect that fact.</p>"}},{"id":"56c0c15d48d4","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"56c0c15d48d4","title":"MySugarDaddy","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"MySugarDaddy.com is a place to meet a girl in your dreams.

Personally, I tend to be on the opposite side of such exchanges, and knowing my readers, I bet you are, too. Sometimes Tinder feels a little too low-class for the jet set, champagne chugging motherfuckers out there, especially if you already know what you’re looking for in a relationship.</p><p></p><p>In case you couldn’t figure it out from the name, <strong>MySugarDaddy.com is a dating site aimed at sugar babies and sugar daddies</strong>. They’ve been around for years now and get close to a million visitors a month, which says a lot about the platform as a whole. Whether you’re looking for a dude to take care of you or you want to do the taking care, they aim to take a lot of the bullshit and the guesswork out of the equation. Let’s see how well they live up to my expectations.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Who’s Going to Be My Sugar Baby?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>They’re clearly shooting for a more refined, sophisticated demographic here. For starters, the overall design is top shelf, with a polished logo, clean typography and a little rundown of the perks out front. Instead of stock black-and-white shots of ladies in their underwear, there’s an auto-playing video montage of couples living large: flying in a private jet, getting massages on the beach, clinking crystal glasses, fine dining and jewelry shopping. If you were hoping for more of a “Wham, bam, thank you, ma’am”, you’ve come to the wrong place. (But be sure to check out my full list of Hookup Sites here at MissAVDH!)</p><p></p><p><strong>MySugarDaddy has members all around the world</strong>. The front page talks about how they’re the market leader in Europe and now available in the United States. If you’re rich enough, what’s a little bit of ocean between you and the sugar baby of your dreams? My only question was how thin those babes would be spread if they’re connecting from everywhere under the sun.</p><p></p><p>One thing that surprised me about all the promo text out front was their emphasis on all the free stuff you can do. “Unlike most dating websites, you don’t need a monthly membership to access our site.” A few basic functions for free are standard everywhere, though, so I was even more eager to get inside and see what I could do without pulling out my wallet. It seems like a weird way to attract rich dudes, but maybe the freebies are aimed more at the ladies.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>But How Do I Get Inside of My Sugar Daddy?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, after submitting the photo, I was shuffled to the European version of the site and I was no longer logged in. I went back and tried to log in, but MySugarDaddy.com told me I had an invalid username and password. When I tried to register an account again, they claimed the email was already in use. I tried to reset my password, but the security email didn’t come through, not even to my spam box.</p><p></p><p>Maybe I should have chosen the Facebook option, but I didn’t have an active Facebook account. I started over with a VPN and a different email address, and the same thing happened again. And then a third time. I’ve run into registration issues on sites with a complicated user verification system, but this just seemed like a supremely annoying glitch.</p><p></p><p>I ended up registering a brand-new Facebook account just to get into MySugarDaddy with. When I tried to login with my new Facebook credentials, I got this message: “There is a 60-minute delay before new accounts can log in to any applications. Please try again in an hour.” Fucking assholes! It would have been really nice to know that before registering multiple accounts and giving myself a headache.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Finally Getting in the Door</h3><p></p><p></p><p>If it wasn’t my job, I probably would have given up and switched to a site like SugarDaddyMeet, which was much easier to sign up for. I kept at it, though, trying different browsers and fucking with my settings along the way. I’m not even sure what the hell I did, but at some point I finally found myself in the MySugarDaddy member’s area.</p><p></p><p>It took way too long, but at least I found some good news inside. Since they say they only recently started operating in the US, I was worried the pickings would be slim. It looks like most of the users might be in the US, though. If you’re in a major metropolitan area, you should have plenty of potential sugar babies to choose from. I’m in Chicago today, and I’ve got a nice spread of babes to peruse.</p><p></p><p>Oh, and peruse I did. Once you’re inside, a lot of the site is nice and open, so I didn’t run into any roadblocks as I poked around in search of a suitable candidate. Like most modern dating sites, My Sugar Daddy has a lot of the features you’d expect out of a social media platform, including the look and feel.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Let’s Find a Sugar Baby</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Technically, only one half of the conversation has to pay. MySugarDaddy.com uses a credit system, and one person will have to spend some to start up the conversation. You can request the other person pay to start chatting, but that’s probably more useful if you’re a sugar baby. As a sugar daddy, I’d probably look like a bum if I did that.</p><p></p><p>Memberships are pretty damn pricey compared to most of the other dating and hookup sites out there, at least the ones that ain’t aimed at sugar daddies. A one-month membership will run you $65, and it comes with 50 credits. That’s enough to start about 10 conversations, so try to choose wisely. If you ain’t that wise, you can always reup your credits at $18 for 50, with discounts on bigger packages.</p><p></p><p>That ain’t too much cash for you, though, is it? If you’re even thinking of becoming a sugar daddy, this should seem like chump change, because the girls are going to want a whole lot more of your monetary attention. My issue with MySugarDaddy ain’t the price, but the absolute pain in the ass it was to get inside. If it’s a verification thing, they should be more up front about the process instead of letting you struggle.</p><p></p><p>Once I finally got into MySugarDaddy.com, it was smooth sailing and I liked what I saw. They let you see enough of the site, including local members, to know whether or not it’ll be worth it to you to splurge on a premium package. My main advice is just to keep at it if you’re having trouble registering or logging in, because the rest of the site seems designed much better than the doorway.

It’s a story as old as time. You take them back for some hardcore BDSM sex in your elaborate sex dungeon with swings, ropes, whips, and the whole nine. But they just aren’t into it and think you’re some kind of freak.</p><p></p><p>You can only shrug that shit off as their loss so many times before it starts to hurt. What if I told you that I knew of a dating site that could guarantee you get matched with someone just as kinky, if not more, than yourself? That’s right pick your jaw up off the floo- oh wait, yeah, should have assumed that was just a ball gag.</p><p></p><p>Anyway, the site I’m dangling in front of you like the good slave you are is a dating hub for fetish freaks and kinky lovers all around called Alt.com. No need to hide your closet full of sex toys on the first date any longer! If you’re a dom, find some sub bitch who loves to call you daddy. If you’re a sub, then find a sexy, strong babe who will take control. And if you’re a switch, then play that field like the dirty slut you are. With over 3 million site views every month, you’re bound (and maybe gagged) to find your perfect match. And these matchmakers have been around, linking and binding together kinky people since fucking 1998, so you know you’re in good hands.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>A ton of Site Options and Features, but a You Need Premium Membership to Use Them</h3><p></p><p></p><p>You have a fuck ton of options to really narrow down what kind of people show up in your social media-esque news feed. You can detail your sexual orientation, what kind of role you like to take in bed, what kinks you have, what kind of kinks or body types you’d like to match with, and that’s just the stuff on the quick view.</p><p></p><p>The real detail comes out in the “Questions &amp; Answers” tab where you can answer a bunch of BDSM questions in as much detail as you want. The questions are things like “What roles are OFF limits to you,” “What are your favorite toys,” and other lifestyle questions like “Describe what you do for a living.” That’s three out of over a hundred questions that you can fill out. It’s super fucking helpful, especially when dealing with BDSM. There are so many kinks out there that you need to know a lot about a protentional hookup before you’re sure you want to dive into sex with them.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Hundreds of Profile Customization Options Help You Find the Right Match</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Scrolling through your feed you’ll see recent updates by people you follow, or people nearby. It’s mostly homemade videos, pictures, and shit like that. Like any other social media site, you can like or comment on the post to give that person some love. If you want to view the actual video or photo, you’ll have to pay up. They have two memberships. Silver and Gold. They’re both the same price per month if you go for a year, so definitely go gold. But it’s not too expensive. It’s like 8 bucks or so a month to actually be able to use the site.</p><p></p><p>If you don’t sign up, you can’t send messages, view profiles, look at posts, or use any of the cool features they have on the site. Besides the feed, you can use the left sidebar to manage your own photos/posts, see how many messages you have, and a whole bunch more shit. Speaking of messages, there’s quite a few bots on here. During my short time on the site I got at least 6 messages from chicks wanting to get to know me. Yeah, sure. My empty profile with no information or photo really must have drawn them in.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Chat, Share Videos/Photos, Read Articles, View Live Cams, and More!</h3><p></p><p></p><p>The “Community” page has a lot to offer. Blogs, discussions, chat rooms, magazines, and more. Go here if you want to chat or discuss your kinks with other people, or just shoot the shit about other stuff. Finally, the “What’s Hot” tab has the best photos and videos posted by users recently. A great place to go if you’re just looking to bust a nut to some amateur BDSM content.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Mobile Site is Much Less Cluttered Than the Desktop Site</h3><p></p><p></p><p>One feature that I thought worked a lot better on mobile was the “Hot or Not” page. You can view profile pictures and choose whether or not you think they’re hot. If they are, they get added to a list on your profile that you can check out later. It makes more sense using this feature on mobile for sure. Much easier just to swipe through instead of having to click around every time.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>MissAVDH’s Favorite Features</h3><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>MissAVDH’s Suggestions</h3><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>MissAVDH’s Final Thoughts</h3><p></p>"}},{"id":"8adedb7e0611","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"8adedb7e0611","title":"3Fun","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"Go3Fun.co is the official homepage of 3Fun 3Fun is a dating app designed for those looking for threesomes with millions of active users iOS and Android versions","canonical":"https://theporndude.com/zh/12883/3fun","affiliate_url":"https://www.go3fun.co/?shortlink=ph9ekrsy&c=TK10939&pid=AF11247&af_xp=custom&source_caller=ui","rating":4,"siteOrder":19,"price":"free","tags":[],"features":["交友"],"categories":[{"id":"best-dating-sites","collection":"categories_en"}],"screenshot_url":"https://cdn.staticstack.net/assets/img/r-thumbs/e33bc_3fun_small.jpg","image_alt":"3Fun, porn dating site","scraped_at":"2025-10-28T20:52:59.490Z","iconSpritesheet":"custom-favicon-spritesheet.png","iconPosition":"-48px -640px","iconClassName":"ctm-icon12883","logoIconClass":"icon12883","pros":["dating app aimed at adults looking for threesomes","app available for ios and android","2.5 million active members","inclusive – sign up as a single or couple with any sexual orientation","block contacts so you don’t run into your family, friends or coworkers"],"cons":["no web version available"],"detailedDescription":"<p>The promo blurb on Go3Fun’s front page confused me for a brief moment after the link slid into my DMs this morning. They call it “The Leading Dating App For Sexually-Free Singles and Partners to Meet Like-Minded People,” and maybe it was just the morning fog clouding my brain or the bong hits I had for breakfast, but I misinterpreted what they meant by sexually free. After rubbing my eyes and adjusting my boner, I realized they weren’t talking about asexuals who don’t fuck. No, this one’s aimed at exactly the opposite demographic.</p><p></p><p>I’m guessing you’re among that target audience, at least if you’ve got a pulse, a libido and a sense of adventure. Go3Fun.co is the home of 3Fun, <strong>a dating app aimed at adults looking for a threesome</strong>. I liked the premise right away, but having reviewed a fair number of enticing-sounding hookup apps without enough users to work well, I was a little skeptical. Once I looked at the traffic stats, though, I was a lot more excited; Go3Fun gets close to 125 million visits a month on their website alone, which is promising as hell. Naturally, I couldn’t wait to get inside and start browsing the local profiles.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Going Fun with Go3Fun</h3><p></p><p></p><p>3Fun is one of few dating apps I’ve reviewed that doesn’t have a web version. Go3Fun.co exists primarily as a promo page for the app, directing potential users to their relevant official app stores to download the thing. You’ll find some basic info like a FAQ, safety tips and the usual legalese filed away on the Terms page. Other than that, there ain’t much to see.</p><p></p><p>It's an interesting choice, one that almost certainly would have been bad for business a decade ago. These days, it’s mildly annoying to me since websites are easier to review than apps, but I’m not sure it’ll matter much for most end users. With the exception of the oldsters in the audience, everybody’s pretty comfortable with mobile apps these days. Sorry, grandpa.</p><p></p><p>The website ain’t totally useless, though, listing some vital stats out front. As I mentioned in the intro, a dating app ain’t much use if nobody is using it, but that clearly ain’t the case here. When you Go 3Fun, you’ll be jumping into the pool for adult swim time with <strong>2.5 million active members</strong>. It’s a nice, fat number, so big I might be ready to call bullshit if I hadn’t already seen the traffic stats. Hell, with odds like that, maybe even the uggos can find a 3-way in their neighborhood.</p><p></p><p>They’re also loud and proud about their inclusivity. 3Fun is for any adult who’s interested, so you can sign up as a single or a couple with any sexual orientation. Honestly, this is something I expect from any hookup platform in the 21st century, but perhaps it’s just a little more important for one designed to make threesomes easier. If there’s three or more of you, chances are a couple of you are going to share the same gender identity.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Getting Right into the 3Fun</h3><p></p><p></p><p>There are a few intro screens on the app before you get to the signup process, mostly just listing the same perks I saw on the Go 3Fun website. The only new wrinkle I noticed was that they don’t allow screenshots. That could be a good thing or a bad thing, depending on what you’re up to, but I imagine you already know that if you’re the screen-shotting type.</p><p></p><p>3Fun will let you log in with an email address once you’ve set up an account, but you can’t sign up for one with email alone. Currently, they’re accepting members using their phone numbers or Facebook. I opted to give them my digits, as Mark Zuckerberg already knows enough about me and my habits.</p><p></p><p>I told 3Fun I was a single male, gave them my birthday and said I was straight. They ain’t kidding about the inclusivity, with more than a dozen sexual orientations, including Polysexual, Heteroflexible and even Asexual, a weird option for threesome seekers. I’m guessing they mean Omnisexual in a different sense than GG Allin, who once boned a dead dog somebody tossed on stage.</p><p></p><p>After telling the app who I was looking for and writing a little blurb about myself, I uploaded a couple pics. Most dating apps will encourage you to upload face pics to start with, but 3Fun had some interesting advice for those testing the waters: “If you are feeling shy or want to be discreet, showing part of your face can be a good start.” This likely widens the pool, even if some of those members may be hiding their mugs initially, which works for me just fine.</p><p></p><p>They even ask you during the signup process if you’d like to block anyone from your phone’s contacts. This is a fucking awesome feature that I wish more hookup apps would implement. If you don’t want your friends, family, coworkers or other associates to see you looking for a threesome when you Go 3Fun, they’ve made it super easy to block them before you even get inside.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>I Think I Might Have 3Fun Tonight</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Within minutes of perusing the local couples looking for a third, I had a notification under the Prospects tab. Somebody Liked me, so I clicked the button to see who it was. I was wondering when they’d ask me for money and, well, here it was. I’d had my account for less than five minutes.</p><p></p><p>It costs thirty bucks a month to fully Go 3Fun, which is neither the cheapest nor the most expensive hookup app I’ve seen. Given the sizable demographic using it and the tight focus on threesome encounters, I think it’s a fair price. They offer some serious discounts on longer plans, with a 6-month subscription that breaks down to just a tenner a month. Keep in mind, dating app prices are fucking weird and aren’t always transparent; these were the prices they gave me as a single straight dude, but I wouldn’t be too surprised to see other prices for other user types. Unicorns, anybody?</p><p></p><p>The perks of paid membership are pretty much what you’d expect. Basically, it opens the app up so it’s a lot more useful. Paying members can Like as many people as they want, message without matching, see who Likes you, and can browse different locations. You also get increased visibility, which could be really useful considering how popular the app is. I never would have guessed this many people were using it in my area, but I’m fucking thrilled.</p><p></p><p>And that’s exactly why I’m going to wrap up this review right here. I’ve got some prospects I’d like to follow up with, which hopefully means I’ll have company tonight. Go3Fun.co promises a lot for a threesome-oriented hookup app, and they actually come through in a way you rarely see from apps promising horny local singles. It’s easy as hell to get signed up and you can start browsing without a paid membership, so I recommend starting there.</p>"}},{"id":"277136af9405","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"277136af9405","title":"FetLife","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"FetLife.com has been able to accept fetishes more easily than society in the past and they have become more popular.

Never before have fetishes and kinks been as popular as they are today. I don’t know if it is because the invention of the internet has led to a greater level of transparency and communication when it comes to peoples’ deepest sexual desires or if it is because we are just becoming more open and accepting as a society. Or maybe it is something else altogether. Whatever the reason, more and more people are embracing their kinks, and it is a beautiful thing to see.</p><p></p><p>Maybe you’ve noticed this firsthand, where, slowly, more and more of your friends start talking about their ddlg kinks, love of BDSM, or foot fetishes. People who have fetishes of any kind are starting to come together. There has been such an increase in people who openly express their kinks and fetishes that the term “fetish culture” has become something close to commonplace. Kink communities all over the world are growing and thriving without a doubt. There are largely attended conferences and classes to be taken in bigger cities and there are more and more websites created every day to cater to the kinks of the fetishly minded.</p><p></p><p>Partly responsible for this huge uptick in kink involvement is a social media website called FetLife. It seems as if Fet Life came out at the perfect time, right in the middle of the rise of social media, and it has stuck around as an institution to all things kink ever since.</p><p></p><p>Not only is it responsible for aiding veteran fetishists in organizing and communicating, but it has shown many a novice enthusiast of kink culture the ropes, so to speak. Their easy to use platform has become nothing short of iconic in the last few years, allowing people to easily and effectively chart where they fall on the spectrum of kink.</p><p></p><p>FetLife, launched in January of 2008, was created by a software designer from Montreal, John Kopanas (sometimes referred to by his username, John Baku). After becoming frustrated with the difficulty of finding girls who had the same kinks as him, he launched Friends With Fetishes, which, over a couple of years, evolved into the FetLife site we know and love today.</p><p></p><p>FetLife became nothing short of a social media phenomenon and has, as of 2017, over 6 million users. This number, of course, is still growing as people are constantly exploring and discovering their own sexual desires.</p><p></p><p>Originally, any user could create a group dedicated to whatever kink they wanted. But, as you might imagine, this eventually got out of hand and, thus, required some stricter moderation. In January of 2017, the ability to create groups was temporarily halted. All groups containing words like blood, needles, r*pe, or taboo were purged from the site and then the group creation feature was reinstated, with these new limitations.</p><p></p><p>All new users are automatically enrolled in the group FetLife Announcements, which will keep you abreast to new site policies and news. There are many other groups in which you can enroll as well, such as Ask a Submissive, Ask a Mistress, Ask a Stripper, Ask a Dom, Novices and Newbies, etc. Other than being a little more group-oriented than other sites, FetLife basically acts like a normal social media site. You can add friends, private chat, follow users, write public messages to users on their walls, post what’s on your mind, and upload pictures and videos (which you can also comment on and like).</p><p></p><p></p><h3>The Best Social Media Site Features, Plus the Fun All the Others are Missing</h3><p></p><p></p><p>The “Explore” section of the site, however, looks like something much closer to Tumblr, in the way random posts appear in a gallery fashion. This section can be finetuned, though, to your liking. Here, you can choose to see recent media posts by just your friends and people you follow, or you can browse the entire FetLife world in sections titled “Kinky and Popular” or “Fresh and Pervy.” You also have easy access to stuff you have “liked,” or, in FetLife speak, “Loved,” allowing you to return to your favorite material over and over again.</p><p></p><p>FetLife also allows you to limit this enormously helpful Explore section to just pictures, just videos, or just text. Or all three if you don’t discriminate. It’s really up to you. Users seem to post sexy content very frequently, too. That means that, although FetLife is most useful as a social media site to connect you to others with similar sexual desires to your own, you could also successfully use FetLife as an endless source for amateur, fetish-oriented porn if you wanted. Your level of participation is, of course, your call.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Online Community to Real Life Friends</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Okay, so, maybe you’ve been on FetLife for a little while now. You’ve started to build an online community and have a good feel for the culture and where you fit in it. Well, my friend, congratulations, you are now ready to start attending some events out there in the real world. The “Events” section of the site is also very actively updated and allows you to get info on upcoming events (meetups, swinger parties, orgies, BDSM classes, etc.) going on in your area.</p><p></p><p>Or, fuck it, in any area. Say you’ll be travelling to a particularly active city in the near future … just check the events section for that city ahead of time and plan a meetup while you’re there. There are few to no limitations on what’s possible with FetLife. It all depends on what you want and are willing to explore.</p><p></p><p>As if those aforementioned features weren’t enough to keep you busy for the next year, FetLife has more to offer. You can browse the site by city, state, or country as well, making it easier than ever to connect with likeminded kinksters, either around the world or right in your backyard.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Great Features, Site Design, Everything</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Plus, there are extremely minimal ads on this site. Which is incredibly rare for a site that is 100% free, but also how it should be. All you will find is one small ad to the right of your newsfeed. And it is usually for a discount on a product that kinksters would actually find useful, so it’s not all that bad at the end of the day. Kudos to you, FetLife for providing an amazing service and putting your users’ experience above all else. We appreciate it.</p><p></p><p>Plus, FetLife has an open-source Android app in the play store. I was not able to test it out as I have an iPhone, but still fucking cool that they offer one at all. Apparently, for my fellow iOS users, an open source app is in the works for us—so, contribute to it if you know how to code!</p><p></p><p>All in all, I fucking love this site. It’s aesthetically pleasing, easy to use, and provides an amazing service: connecting sexually open, curious, or experienced individuals with other likeminded people, both around and outside of their neighborhoods. It is just as useful for the novice as it is for the veteran kinkster; people are generally pretty cool about educating and helping others figure out their paths when possible.</p><p></p><p>Pair all these great features with the fact that FetLife is composed of an extremely active community and you have a site that you cannot go wrong with. You can get as much or as little out of it as you desire. As I said before, it can also double as a great amateur porn site if you aren’t necessarily trying to go out and meet up with anyone.</p><p></p><p>If you already know where you fall on the kink spectrum, then I would be shocked that you are just now getting around to considering making a profile on FetLife. If that is the case, stop reading this immediately and start chatting with your tribe! If you are a budding beginner kinkster, do not be shy … head on over to fetlife.com (often misspelled as \"fettlife\") and start exploring. I think you’ll be very happy with what you find. It’s always good to have a community. You are never alone!</p>"}},{"id":"723c7af41c70","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"723c7af41c70","title":"Tinder","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"Tinder.com is the most popular dating and picking up app in the world, probably your best choice for picking up girls tonight.

I know it’s exactly the kind of thing I write about around here, but it’s kind of like whipping up a review of McDonald’s on a website about restaurants. Everybody knows what a Chicken McNugget tastes like and how they’ve got two drive-through lanes, so what is there to talk about? It’s a little embarrassing, but it’s taken some gentle nudging from my loyal visitors to finally put out my official report.</p><p></p><p>I’m sure most of you know what Tinder.com is, but in case you’ve been living under a rock or been trapped in a weird anti-technology, anti-sex cult for the last decade, <strong>it’s the most popular dating app in the world</strong>. Even if you’ve never gotten laid on it or even tried it for yourself, you almost certainly know people who have gotten some action just by doing a little swiping. While it might not work for everybody, I still think it’s one of the easiest ways for a lot of folks to get laid. Let’s take a closer look and I’ll explain why.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Holy Shit, Look at All These Single Women!</h3><p></p><p></p><p>One of biggest draws of Tinder is that it’s literally the biggest pool you can jump into, at least when it comes to online dating. <strong>There is no other dating site or app with nearly as many people</strong>. If you’ve read any of my reviews of similar platforms, you know user numbers are one of the very first things I look for. With over 75 million active monthly users, Tinder absolutely crushes every single one of their competitors. It ain’t even close.</p><p></p><p>The upside of that massive userbase is obvious: you’ve got a shit ton of potential partners to mingle with. There are some issues with attending a giant party, though, especially if you’ve got particular interests, tastes, kinks or needs. A lot of dating sites target certain demographics by offering perks catered to them, while Tinder just throws out a huge net to catch everybody. Depending on who you are, where you live, and what you’re looking for, Tinder might be completely wrong for you. Grandpa might not do so well around here, even if his dick still works.</p><p></p><p>Another big, easy selling point is their app available for iOS and Android. One of the reasons they’ve gotten so fucking popular is that the app is so readily available, and so fucking easy to use. A lot of dating sites have corresponding apps, but very few of them have had half as much money as Tinder to throw back into development. I crack jokes about it all the time, but it really is one of the easiest hookup apps for anybody to use, regardless of your tech level or even basic literacy.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>So How Does Tinder Work, Exactly?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Setting up your account is easier than other platforms, too. Instead of thumbing a thousand words about yourself over multiple pages of profile questions, you’ll just upload some photos and whip up a little bio blurb. You can be fully set up and ready to rock within a few minutes.</p><p></p><p>I will say, though, that a little effort can go a long way. If you leave your bio blank and just do photos, you’d better make sure those are some fucking stellar selfies. Different people respond to different tactics in different ways, so there’s no real “right” way to do things. Jokes can work, as can sounding smart or showing off your wealth. Depending on who you’re after, these can all hurt you, too. Unless you’re just a total fucking empty-headed loser with nothing to offer, though, it’s usually better to write something.</p><p></p><p>Once you’ve got your Tinder.com account set up, it’s time to start swiping. It’s dead fucking simple: swipe right on people you’re interested in, and swipe left on those you aren’t. It’s like flipping through a stack of baseball cards, only you might end up getting laid instead of just feeling like a dork collecting sports cards as an adult.</p><p></p><p>Whatever you do, don’t just swipe right on every woman you see, hoping for a huge pile of matches. Tinder uses hidden user scores and mystical algorithms to decide who gets seen, and excess swiping can fuck up your chances. They don’t make their inner workings public, so there’s still a little guesswork involved. You need to be engaging with at least some of your matches, too, or your super-secret score goes down, putting you at the bottom of the stack—if you’re even seen at all.</p><p></p><p>If you’ve seen my work at MissAVDHCasting, banging some of the world’s most beautiful pornstars, you probably know why I haven’t been very active in the dating scene lately. I signed up today for some insight writing this review, and I’ve been swiping through beauties and uggos in the Chicagoland area. In a big city like this, it seems like I have an endless number of women to judge based on their looks and bio blurbs. Smaller towns won’t have as many, but since this is the most popular dating app, you should still have some.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Really? I Can Message Babes for Free?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>They’ve got to make their money somewhere, though. The app will start hitting you up for cash soon after you start swiping, enticing you with the prospect of more matches if you upgrade your account. I’d tell you how much their three membership tiers cost, but the prices are secret and vary wildly. Remember those secret algorithms I mentioned? They also decide how much you have to pay. Older users and dudes, for example, pay more than young people and women.</p><p></p><p>Tinder Plus is the cheapest tier, giving you unlimited Likes, some Super Likes and a Boost every month. Boost pushes you to the top of the stack, which increases your visibility, but I think the unlimited Likes are more important if you’re in a big city. Tinder gold is the next step up, and tells you who Likes you before you even swipe. I’ve used this successfully to get laid with basically no effort, just checking daily to see who finds me attractive.</p><p></p><p>Tinder Platinum is the priciest tier. It puts you at the top of the stack for people you’ve Liked, and gives you the option of sending messages before you even match. I think it’s overkill for most users, even though it may boost your odds a little. For most folks, I’d recommend Gold if the free version ain’t doing it for you.</p><p></p><p>At the end of the day, everyone’s going to have a slightly different approach to Tinder.com than the next guy, though the process stays the same. Some might argue their popularity is a self-fulfilling prophecy, but it doesn’t change the basic facts: as the most popular dating platform, with an insane number of users, it gives you the best odds. It’s huge, it’s easy to use, and it’s legitimately free, so what have you got to lose?</p>"}},{"id":"99e039b5c589","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"99e039b5c589","title":"Instagram","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"Instagram.com is one of the most popular social media networks in the world with billions of users sharing photos and videos to connect to girls every month","canonical":"https://theporndude.com/zh/12708/instagram","affiliate_url":"https://www.instagram.com/","rating":4,"siteOrder":22,"price":"free","tags":[],"features":[],"categories":[{"id":"best-dating-sites","collection":"categories_en"}],"screenshot_url":"https://cdn.staticstack.net/assets/img/r-thumbs/c1c20_instagram_small.jpg","image_alt":"Instagram, porn dating site","scraped_at":"2025-10-28T20:53:17.081Z","iconSpritesheet":"custom-favicon-spritesheet.png","iconPosition":"-80px -624px","iconClassName":"ctm-icon12708","logoIconClass":"icon12708","pros":["social media network with an emphasis on photo and video","wildly popular app available","absolutely massive userbase, including 43% of american women","not a dating site"],"cons":["not a dating site"],"detailedDescription":"<p>Have you used Instagram to get laid yet? It ain’t designed for that purpose, which might be one of the best reasons why it works. On the other hand, it’s the same reason why some of you may never meet a partner through the platform. It depends a lot on how you approach it and what you’re doing with it, so I figured I’d give out a few pointers that might help you along. At the end of the day, there ain’t much penalty for failure, so how bad could it hurt?</p><p></p><p>Just in case you’ve been living under a rock for the last decade, <strong>Instagram.com is one of the most popular social media networks out there</strong>. That alone makes it a fucking goldmine of potential fuck buddies if you know how to work it properly. Unlike other social networks with an emphasis on text-based posts or work-related bullshit, this one is designed primarily for sharing photos and video. It’s one of the most popular sites on the internet, getting around a hundred million visitors each and every day. That’s way more ladies than you’ll find on the local hookup apps, so let’s see about putting the moves on them.</p><p></p><p>You can play with Instagram via the web or use their wildly popular app, available for iOS and Android. It’s so fucking popular that it’s sometimes preinstalled on brand new phones. Before I ever used it, I had an Android that came with the app and wouldn’t even let me uninstall the bastard. These days, I’m quick to download it as soon as I get a new device.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Just Who’s Using Instagram?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>I looked up their user demographics a few minutes ago, and I was just a little bit surprised by what I found. I’d wrongly assumed most Insta users are female, but globally, they’re slightly outnumbered by dudes. It could be an American discrepancy, because a whopping 43% of women in the USA are using it. Compare that to just 31% of American dudes, which frankly puts you at an advantage if you’re trying to use it to meet chicks in the US.</p><p></p><p>Let’s be real: dating is very often a numbers game. There are virgins out there who don’t understand how their ugly friends get laid, but it ain’t that complicated. You have to put yourself out there, whether that’s at the bar, on Tinder, the ‘gram or anywhere else. The dudes with the highest body counts are the ones willing to strike out along the way. Good looks, smooth moves, strong game and fat pockets are nice to have, but the biggest factor is probably just how deep the pool is.</p><p></p><p>Instagram.com is one of the biggest pools out there, by a fucking enormous margin. The internet’s an incredible thing, because there’s no physical place that would put you in contact with that many people all at once. There’s no club you can go to, no dating site you can join, and no friendly party you can attend where you’ll have even a fraction of the opportunities this one puts in front of you. What are you going to do with those opportunities?</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Who Do You Know, and Who Do Your Friends Know?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>If you’ve struggled with the dating scene and struck out on the usual apps and services, you’ve probably heard somebody say it’s better to meet people through mutual friends. That’s solid advice, but it ain’t always practical. Depending on factors like your age, your location, your hours, or the company you keep, you may not rub elbows with friends of friends as often as you’d like.</p><p></p><p>Here's where Instragram comes in. In real life and on the internet, it really is easier to chat up women you share a mutual friend with. Unlike real life, though, those potential interactions ain’t limited to the rare Christmas party, wedding or spontaneous BDSM orgy. Hell, you can go on the site right now and Follow somebody you met one time at a back yard barbecue, or even somebody you only saw in a photo your sister posted.</p><p></p><p>Will she Follow back? It ain’t guaranteed, but a lot of people just do it by default, even if they’ve never heard of you and you don’t have any mutual friends. If you do know some of the same people, though, your chances are a lot better. You ain’t some total stranger. Even if your name has never come up in conversation, mutual friends still count as kind of a natural verification and validation system. It’s got to be at least a hundred times more effective than any Verified badge on any dating website.</p><p></p><p>A Follow on Instagram obviously ain’t the same as a Match on a hookup site. In fact, it can be completely meaningless. It can also be a good first step, a tiny connection that can lead to a bigger one. That person is now going to see what you’re posting on the site. From here, you’ve just got to choose whether to play the slow game or just slide right into those DMs.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Are You Hot and Interesting Enough?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>What’s most important if you’re trying to get laid? That honestly depends a lot on who you’re trying to bang. Instagram models and vapid influencers might get turned on by a high follower count, but I’d say the importance of the high score goes down as you and your potential partners get older. You probably need some, though, because it shows you ain’t a weird recluse with no friends or acquaintances.</p><p></p><p>Instagram.com is designed for sharing your own media, and I’d say this is going to be the vital factor for most people trying to use it to meet people. Unlike dating sites and apps, you ain’t limited to a handful of images. Your feed can be a perfect reflection of you, showing people who you are and what you’re into. Whether that’s a good or bad thing depends on what kind of picture you can paint of yourself, and who you’re trying to meet.</p><p></p><p>There’s no one size-fits-all answer if you’re wondering what you should post on Instagram. Selfies can show off your rugged good looks and sweet wardrobe, but too many can make you look self-absorbed. Hobby photos can be a double-edged sword: you might meet a nerdy chick who loves Naruto as much as you do, but you’re going to scare away the girls who don’t like neckbeards and fedoras.</p><p></p><p>Instagram.com is a pretty easy recommendation in general, whether you’re looking to make connections or just share photos of your sad, lonely lunch every day. The site and corresponding app are insanely popular and can help relieve boredom, and loneliness to a certain extent, even if you’re not trying to meet people with it. I didn’t touch on all the models sharing bikini pics that are just barely SFW, nor the fact that some younger demographics think it’s weird not to have an Insta account. It’s free to use and easy to sign up, so it couldn’t hurt to just poke around a little.</p>"}}]

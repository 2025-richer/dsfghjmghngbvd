Well, you’re in luck, because it just so happens I know exactly the guy. Do you realize MissAVDH has been around for nearly a decade now and gets a couple of millions of visits a day? I may have started as just another masturbator like you, but I’ve since turned my hobby into a full-on career.</p><p></p><p>I pride myself on my unbiased reviews of all the best and worst adult sites the Internet has to offer, but I’m probably at least a little partial to this next one. I did make it, after all. PornWebmasters.com was unveiled to the public toward the end of 2024, and my traffic stats have been climbing steadily ever since. My goal was to build <strong>the best free resource for adult webmasters</strong>, a massive directory of tools, services, sites, and software to build your free lesbian tube, hentai library, or premium anal paysite. Whether you’ve been in the business for decades or you’re still just flirting with the idea of starting your own celebrity nude blog, this site is for you.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Allow Me to Toot My Own Horn for a Minute</h3><p></p><p></p><p>And just why would all these random perverts and wannabe porn webmasters be hitting me up, as opposed to the experts over at Brazzers, the neckbeards on Reddit or the weirdo who runs your favorite golden showers tube? Well, part of it is just the fact that I’m accessible, but <strong>I’ve also got experience reviewing thousands of porn sites in pretty much every legal category</strong>. I understand what’s going to make your amateur forum visitors leave forever, what’s going to draw wankers to your porn comics, and how to stand out among the thousands of free sex tubes already out there.</p><p></p><p>I ain’t just a casual observer, either. Any determined pervert with a ton of forearm stamina and an IV drip of Viagra can review gobs and gobs of smut, but I’ve also built multiple successful adult sites. MissAVDH is the big king daddy of them, but I’ve also branched out with other review sites like MyGaySites, BestPornGames and PornGeek. I even launched my own casting porn site recently, MissAVDHCasting, where you can watch me bang some world-class pornstars. I understand the business intimately because I’m balls-deep in it!</p><p></p><p></p><h3>What Makes PornWebmasters So Special?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>There’s also the matter of cost. There are so many smarty-pants motherfuckers out there on the Internet who tell you they’ve got some valuable information that can make you a ton of money; then they tease you with a couple of data points to convince you to buy their ebook or online master class. Half the time, they’re just selling outdated schemes to trick Google with a flood of keywords. It may have worked a decade ago, but the same strategies may well get you deranked or delisted altogether if you tried today.</p><p></p><p>Like MissAVDH, I keep PornWebmasters up to date with the latest tools and resources for online porn pushers. Also, like MissAVDH, the site is absolutely free to use, with no signup necessary and no spam. You’re not going to pay for outdated tools or other bullshit, because you’re not going to pay at all.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Who Said Anything About Bullshit?</h3><p></p><p></p><p><strong>I’ve structured PornWebmasters just like MissAVDH to make it easy as hell to find what you’re looking for</strong>. My resources are grouped into more than a hundred categories like Adult Ad Networks, Porn Tube Webmaster Programs, Adult WordPress Plugins and SEO Tools. Under each category, I’ve ranked the different services and tools by how effective and useful I think they’ll be for the average adult webmaster.</p><p></p><p>Now, those rankings will help you gauge the overall quality of the different Porn Webmasters resources, but online smut ain’t a one-size-fits-all kind of game. The dating affiliate sites that convert well on an amateur porn forum may not be the right fit for a premium fisting emporium, while the adult CDN used for a massive JAV tube is probably serious overkill if you’re just running an erotic stories library. That’s why <strong>I’ve written up long, in-depth reviews of the sites and services</strong>, much like I’ve done here at MissAVDH.</p><p></p><p>It’s one thing for somebody to point you in the right direction, but I’m doing more than that. My reviews dig deep into the features, the perks and drawbacks, and that all-important factor, the cost. That’ll give you an edge when choosing every element of your porn operation, from your web host to your popunder ad network, your backlink sources to your adult SEO services. There’s no reason to stumble around blind with your dicks out, friends.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Building Your Own Porn Site with Porn Webmasters</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Maybe you’re new to this, though, in which case you’re probably wondering where to start. Well, first, consider what type of adult site you’d like to run. I’ve listed a variety of scripts, plugins and WordPress themes that can help you put together a tube, webcam sex site, video aggregator or adult forum in a matter of days without any technical experience. Hell, I’ve even got adult link directory scripts if you’d like to make your own personal imitation of MissAVDH.</p><p></p><p>Once you’ve picked a name for your brand, you’ll need to register it and then find a good webhost. Naturally, I’ve got the most reliable, cost-effective porn-friendly registrars and hosts listed on Porn Webmasters. If you need content, I’ve got sources for porn available, too.</p><p></p><p>From there, it’s largely a matter of building traffic and figuring out how to best monetize your brand. Get those visitors coming with SEO tools, link building tools, guest posts on blogs and other techniques I’ve laid out. You can earn money from popunder ad networks, webcam affiliates, CPA networks, among others.</p><p></p><p>I’ve tried to include enough info with each category of webmaster tools that you’ll learn something, and know whether it’s a good fit for your porn empire, even if it’s your very first time. I’m also confident that even experienced webmasters can learn a thing or two just by reading the site. Are you picking up what I’m putting down?</p><p></p><p>Like the Internet itself, PornWebmasters.com is in a state of constant change. I’ll be continually updating it as I come across new tools and services that might be helpful to online pornographers, and weeding out the ones that are past their prime. No matter what kind of adult website you’re running, my goal is to provide you with everything you need to build a successful and fap-worthy porn empire. What are you waiting for? Get building, and then hit me up when you’re ready so I can check it out for MissAVDH!</p>"}},{"id":"442b9774816a","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"442b9774816a","title":"PornDudeCash","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"MissAVDHCash.com is a franchisee program website for MissAVDH Casting.

Ever since MissAVDH started blowing up years ago, I’ve been getting requests from fans eager to spread their love for the brand and maybe earn a couple bucks while they’re at it. I’d kicked around a number of ideas before coming up with this, and I think you’re going to love it. Hell, I’m going to love it, too. It’s one of those things where literally everybody wins—kind of like porno!</p><p></p><p><strong>MissAVDHCash.com lets you earn money by promoting my brand and my dirty movies</strong>, plain and simple. It’s an affiliate program, which I’m sure some of you may have some experience with. Trust me, though, this ain’t some bullshit like those sketchy diet shakes your sister-in-law is always trying to sell you at family gatherings. Dirty movies are something everybody can enjoy, and I know you perverts love chatting about sex whenever you get the opportunity. Well, here’s a monetary incentive to make even more noise about blowjobs, big boobies and pornstars.</p><p></p><h3>Who Wants Some MissAVDH Cash?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>If you haven’t seen it yet, I started another site a while back called PornWebmasters. The format is a lot like what I do here at MissAVDH, only I’ve compiled lists of resources like Adult Ad Networks, Adult Link Building Tools, Adult Backlink Sites and yeah, Adult Paysite Affiliate Programs, too. I include a lot of info on how to use those tools, too, because my goal is for the site to be as useful for a brand newbie to online smut peddling as it would be to a seasoned pro.</p><p></p><p>As you may have guessed from the name, PornWebmasters.com is mainly aimed at porn webmasters. If you’re running a free tube, a porn blog or adult message board, you could rake in some of my MissAVDHCash with some well-placed banner ads or text links. The webmasters in the audience probably already know how to do that, since it’s pretty much Affiliate Marketing 101.</p><p></p><p>What if you’re not an aspiring webmaster, though? Well, you can still use MissAVDHCash.com to <strong>get yourself a piece of the pie even if you don’t have a website</strong>. Affiliate programs on the internet are actually simpler than they appear. While it helps to have a website to drive clicks in your direction, it ain’t mandatory. In fact, once you sign up and get the affiliate link, you can post it all over the fucking place: in text messages or emails, DMs, blog comments, forum posts, or even handwritten on Post-It notes and stuck to your neighbor’s windshield. The sky’s the limit!</p><p></p><h3>But What’s In It For Me?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Sign up with MissAVDHCash and you stand to <strong>earn a 50% recurring revshare off of MissAVDHCasting memberships</strong>. I’m currently charging thirty bones a month for the standard rate. For every monthly subscriber you send my way, you’re going to take home fifteen bucks a month, every month until they cancel their membership. That’s $180 a year, or $18,000 if they stay signed up for a century! Get a subscriber for a millennium and you can finally pay off those student loans, all thanks to MissAVDH.</p><p></p><p>Once you reach the payout threshold, you can get your hard-earned MissAVDH Cash via international wire or Paxum. There’s a zero-dollar payout fee, so you don’t have to worry about some low-life middleman skimming some off the top. That’s your money! Take it home, spend it on the wife or go all-out and finally get the waifu pillow dry cleaned. They can give you all the dirty looks they want, but you can feel satisfied knowing you’ve provided for your anime princess through your tireless efforts at promoting casting-couch pornography with a big-headed stud.</p><p></p><p>I know I already mentioned that you can promote MissAVDHCash without a website, but let’s get into some practicalities for a minute. While you may have a bunch of horny friends, Instagram followers and a private message board full of local amateur porn fans to tap into, there’s real money to be made here in volume. One of my key lessons over at PornWebmasters is that traffic equals conversions: the more eyes and the more clicks you drive through your affiliate links, the more buyers you’re going to have out of the bunch.</p><p></p><p>If you start earning some MissAVDH Cash without a website, it’s probably going to give you a taste for more. When you feel you’re ready for the next level, check out PornWebmasters for some tips on setting up your own website, building traffic and boosting your Google status. Whether you decide to build a tube, a porn aggregator, or just a personal landing page to hawk your own personal brand, I’ve got the resources ranked, reviewed and explained to make things as easy as possible. Sprinkle that with your MissAVDHCash.com affiliate link and watch the magic happen.</p><p></p><h3>Making Money with MissAVDH</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Maybe it sounds like I’m tooting my own horn, but I think MissAVDH Casting kind of sells itself, meaning you’ve got an easy job cut out for you. You can find other brands out there shooting casting videos, and other paysites full of pornstars you recognize, but how many of them have a mascot as funny as yours truly? There are a handful of really good reasons MissAVDH has been the #1 online porn directory for so long, and this guy right here is a chief factor.</p><p></p><p>If you check out MissAVDHCash.com right now, MissAVDHCasting is the only site available to promote. Honestly, that should keep you almost as busy promoting as I am shooting, on top of my usual porn-reviewing duties. That said, you never know what the future holds for MissAVDH empire. I’m always looking to expand, so keep your eye on MissAVDHCash to see if I launch something else you can promote.</p><p></p><p><strong>I’ve set up MissAVDHCash using NATS affiliate tracking software</strong>. This might sound like gibberish if you’re brand new to online marketing and affiliate programs, but you’ll recognize the name if you’ve been doing this for more than a day or two. NATS is one the industry standards, thanks to its high accuracy and scalability. For one thing, it ain’t going to glitch out and cost you revshares you earned. It also makes it easy from my end to keep track of things, and add more sites to my portfolio at some point down the line.</p><p></p><p>So what are you waiting for? MissAVDH Cash signup form only takes a minute to fill out, so you can start sharing your affiliate link right away. You guys keep asking me how you can make some money with internet porn, and I’ve made it as easy as I possibly can with MissAVDHCash. Let’s all lend each other a sticky helping hand and reap the benefits together.</p>"}}]

Man, I love <a href=\"https://MissAVDH.com/blog/top-10-celebrity-sex-tapes/\" target=\"_blank\">celebrity sex tapes</a>! Ever dream of getting a glimpse of Emma Stone’s tight little ass? Or maybe getting your hands on a never before seen sex video of Jennifer Lawrence? I know you have. Fuck, who hasn’t?</p><p></p><p>Nobody tries to keep these videos or pictures as hidden like the most popular people on the planet do. These celebrities keep that shit under lock and key.</p><p></p><p>Bannedsextapes.com is a premium site with all of the newest and porn pics, videos, and sex tapes of celebrities. They claim to have every single sex tape there is! I don’t know how to check that, but their catalog is pretty damn impressive. And so is their traffic. They’ve got a solid 6 million visitors coming in each month, and they are steadily growing! With over a decade of building up content, they have a shit ton of celebrity mistakes on here for your viewing pleasure.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>A Lot of Great Content but at a Premium Cost</h3><p></p><p></p><p>But hey, good things always cost some money, right? Let’s see just how good these banned sex tapes are. The site has a fairly basic white background with black boxes. It doesn’t feel like a super-premium site by its looks, but it’s not a bad layout by any means. Up top, you’ll get a big ass preview of their newest pictures or tapes. Right now, they have some new content from Paige (a WWE star), and Rhianna. So far, it’s living up to the hype. Did you know Rhianna has a pierced nip? God that’s hot.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Kinky Content from all of the Top Celebrities</h3><p></p><p></p><p>If you don’t see your favorite celeb on the front page, then I would recommend checking out some of their other pages. You can see the lasts pictures and videos on their updates page, browse their sex tapes section for a master list of every tape on the site or go their \"browse\" tab to sort by specific celebs, clips, shows, or pics.</p><p></p><p>Every one of these pages is organized well. You can sort by views, ratings, upload date, and all of that good stuff. Also, if you click on a certain model you can see their biography and all their content. Usually, you’d only see stuff like their pictures and videos, but here you also get to see all the “toon” or drawings of them, plus any fake photoshopped pictures.</p><p></p><p>Now, most of the clips, shows, and pics will be stuff from movies. Actually, I’d say a good portion of the content on this site are hand-picked nude scenes from certain movies. That’s not necessarily a bad thing, but just know going in that there is going to a be a lot of that kind of stuff here. That’s not to say that they are lacking in sex tapes. There are a fuck ton of those for most of the celebrities they have listed here, but the movie content will be more common.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Ads Even with Premium Account, “Free” Porn Section, And An A+ Mobile Site</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Another feature that doesn’t make any fucking sense to me is that there are still ads. If I’m paying for a site, especially one this expensive, I shouldn’t see a single fucking advertisement. It’s insulting! There aren’t any pop-ups or anything, but still. Just seeing those few ads is frustrating and makes the site feel less premium than it is.</p><p></p><p>But enough of that. Let’s talk about the videos and photo content. You won’t get 4k HD content here. It’s not the site for that. Often the recordings are poor quality or shaky since it’s not professionally recorded. If you’re okay with that, then you’ll love the content they do have. All of those videos are so fucking hot. I always knew that the thing missing from my life was getting to watch Miley Cyrus suck some mad dick.</p><p></p><p>If you absolutely need HD, then you might have better luck in their photo section. Often times these pics are captured by TMZ or some other media outlet if it’s something tamer like a nip slip or wardrobe malfunction. Even the non-professional grade pics can be pretty decent quality. Like Emma Watson’s bath pics. Damn, she has got some nice titties.</p><p></p><p>The mobile site was one of the smoothest, most responsive porn sites I think I have ever used on mobile. Pages loaded in a snap, videos played instantly, and the site was very easy to navigate. Whoever was in charge of that deserves some recognition. Definitely a great deal of effort was put into the mobile site.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>MissAVDH’s Favorite Features</h3><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>MissAVDH Hates</h3><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>MissAVDH’s Final Thoughts</h3><p></p>"}},{"id":"fea84c9b3fd1","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"fea84c9b3fd1","title":"Asian NewAWMG","lang":"en","date":"2025-09-22T00:00:00.000Z","description":"Asian.NewAWMG.com has long and high-quality deepfakes27k videos and Hollywood beauties starring your favorite KpopJpop and Cpop Girls AV idols.","canonical":"https://theporndude.com/zh/16773/kpopdeepfakes","affiliate_url":"https://asian.newawmg.com/?ref=2f801352-f946-429e-bbe5-8560af93313f","siteOrder":2,"price":"free","tags":[],"features":[],"categories":[{"id":"premium-nude-celebrities","collection":"categories_en"}],"screenshot_url":"https://cdn.staticstack.net/assets/img/r-thumbs/c7e738e-kpopdeepfakes_small.png","image_alt":"Asian NewAWMG, Paid Celebrity Nude Photos","scraped_at":"2025-09-22T03:07:27.650Z","iconSpritesheet":"default","rating":3.5}},{"id":"360422a3fd58","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"360422a3fd58","title":"Mr Skin","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"Mrskin.comMr Skin is one of the best paid websites on the internet to share celebrity pornographic videos and videos with reasonable membership prices.

Who hasn't heard of MrSkin (blog)? Well, do you love the thrill of seeing your favorite actress strip nude or get fucked during your favorite movies? Are you the person always eagerly awaiting the next sex scene to pop during your weekly HBO or Showtime series? Then I have just the genre of porn for you. Celebrity nudes! No more sitting through an entire boring episode of some hour-long show just to catch a glimpse of Emmy Rossum’s perky little tits. What if I told you there was a site that cataloged every single nude scene from every show and movie past and presently out there? I’d probably say that’s impossible, but that is exactly what I’ve got for you this time. Are you fucking excited? You should be.</p><p></p><p>Mrskin.com should be a familiar name to any of you who dabble in celebrity porn. This site is one of the most popular sites out there for this kind of content with over 11 million views every month. Considering this is a premium site, that’s a lot of fucking people tuning in here to catch the newest celebrity sex scenes. And Mrskin.com is a veteran of the celebrity porn genre with over 20 years of experience. These guys have been around since 1998! That’s simply incredible. Let’s jump in and see how this site has gotten to be so popular.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Sleek Site Design with Great Search Features and a Premium Feel</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Before I dive into the menus, I want to say that the site layout and design are awesome. Differently sized previews, layout options, and more make the site nice to look at. Some porn sites don’t pay attention to that shit. I’m glad Mrskin does, especially since this is a premium site. It looks and feels premium for sure. The white design actually goes well with the site, too. I’d usually complain about it, but it gives it a clean and polished vibe.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Many Different Menus to Explore that are all Full of Great Content</h3><p></p><p></p><p>The browse option is easy enough to figure it. You can browse by celebrities, movies &amp; tv shows, clips, or pics. Each of these pages will give you additional filter options for shit like overall rating, format (TV or Movie), HD options, a full list of porn genres, network, country, and decade released. Holy fuck you are swimming in options on this site. I wish I could linger more here, but we must keep the lightning round here going.</p><p></p><p>Playlists, here you can view site made playlists where they collect related pics and clips for you to view together. Like “Best Butts of 2018, Super Shocking Sex Scenes, Every Rachel Weisz Nude Scene,” and many, many more. This is a great place to go if you want to just sit back and let the videos play while you jerk off or something. Some of these playlists have over 50 scenes in one. Damn!</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Custom Playlists, Videos, Special Deals, and More!</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Specials is just an ad page where you can get deals on other porn sites, so let’s skip right past that. The blog is pretty neat. You can see new video announcements and read up about certain movies or about Mrskin getting mentioned through some media outlet. The store is a store. You can rep some mrskin merch if you really feel the need to. And free live cams are, you guessed it, a link to a site called Mrskinbabes.com with some free live cams you could check out.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Full-Length Show and Movie Reviews, Nude Scene Guides, and Other Cool Features</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Then, you can organize the page below for the content you want. Sort by clips, pics, celebs, or even read their guides for nude scenes or episodes. The episode guides are really fucking cool. You can read summaries for every single episode as well as click-through every nude scene from said episode. The clips have tags so you can see what kind of nudity to expect too. I really don’t know what else you could possibly want from a celebrity porn site. They have it fucking all.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Great Mobile Experience!</h3><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>MissAVDH’s Favorite Features</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Other than that, I enjoy just about everything this site is doing. The site design is on point, the mobile experience is great, there aren’t any ads, the menus all make sense, the video's information you get is the most specific I’ve ever seen, and, to top it off, it’s pretty fucking affordable depending on the payment plan you. Less expensive than a couple of coffees out every month. Not bad at all.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>MissAVDH’s Suggestions</h3><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>MissAVDH’s Final Thoughts</h3><p></p>"}},{"id":"e1bcb62f1ee8","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"e1bcb62f1ee8","title":"CinemaCult","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"CinemaCult.com is a high-end collection of celebrity sex scenes in mainstream movies, carefully curated by the erotic movie fanatic.","canonical":"https://theporndude.com/zh/17999/cinemacult","affiliate_url":"https://cinemacult.com/","rating":4,"siteOrder":4,"price":"free","tags":[],"features":[],"categories":[{"id":"premium-nude-celebrities","collection":"categories_en"}],"screenshot_url":"https://cdn.staticstack.net/assets/img/r-thumbs/b2a1202-cinemacult_small.png","image_alt":"CinemaCult, Paid Celebrity Nude Photos","scraped_at":"2025-10-28T17:13:26.955Z","iconSpritesheet":"custom-favicon-spritesheet.png","iconPosition":"-368px -832px","iconClassName":"ctm-icon17999","logoIconClass":"icon17999","pros":["premium library of mainstream nude scenes","thousands of naked celebs from around the world","preview pics galore","cheap memberships","daily updates","downloads included"],"cons":["softcore by modern porn standards"],"detailedDescription":"<p>Are you part of a Cinema Cult? Some of the film buffs in the audience might be raising their hands, thinking they’re in the club because they attended a couple midnight shows over the years. I’m talking about a specific cult here, though, not just any random group of cinephiles or movie nerds. The daily topic of conversation here at MissAVDH is porno movies, of course, but we’re not chatting about those today, either. Don’t worry, though: this cult has plenty of masturbatory mana in their temple.</p><p></p><p><strong>CinemaCult.com is a premium collection of celebrity nudie scenes from mainstream films</strong>. They’re actually one of the older libraries of this type, having been around in some form or another since 1999, when they were called AvalonMovies. The joint describes themselves as “The largest European nude celebrity site,” but as we’ll see, they don’t limit the roster to Euro starlets. Let’s go find some familiar faces attached to naked boobies, shall we?</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Pretty Faces You Know and Love, Plus Boobs</h3><p></p><p></p><p>I didn’t recognize the celebs in the first few thumbnails I saw on the front page, so I initially thought this was a vintage porn library. The most recent preview images are grainy technicolor screencaps of topless beauties with big ‘70s hair. Scrolling down a little, I saw varied image quality indicating erotica of various eras, from the fluffy-bushed ‘80s to the DVD days of the ‘90s to more modern, high-resolution cinematography.</p><p></p><p>The first gals I spotted whose names I knew included Sigourney Weaver laying in a bathtub with a serious face and exposed jugs (from A Map of the World), Sandra Bullock doing her best to hide her naughty bits (The Proposal), and Alice Eve laying back in bed, in the buff (Crossing Over). A front-page list of CinemaCult.com’s Nude Celebrities of the Week includes Sophie Turner, Paula Beer, Ajita Wilson and Anamaria Vartolomei.</p><p></p><p>CinemaCult calls itself a European celebrity nude site, but what actually constitutes a European celebrity in the 21st century? We’re living in a global era, so you’re probably whacking off to a global selection of famous hotties, no matter where you happen to be sitting as you fap away. The range of women here reflects that, as <strong>they’ve got thousands of nude celebrities from around the world</strong>. They’re quickly coming up on the 10,000 mark, and may well have crossed it by the time you read this.</p><p></p><p>The full Celebrities list is an unwieldy index through no fault of their own; there are just too many babes for a clean menu. It’s 26 pages divided by first letter, each one unfolding as one long-ass page. I kind of wish there were pictures beside each name, if only because I’m not familiar with all these chicks. That said, the sheer size and scope of the menu probably makes pics impractical.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Preview Pics and Cheap Tix</h3><p></p><p></p><p>If you want to get inside, tickets are about half what you’d pay for a typical paysite. There’s no exclusive content here like you’d find at MissAVDHCasting or any other platform charging the industry-standard thirty bones a month, but you will find a curated collection of mainstream sex scenes that’d take you years of grueling labor to piece together yourself. The signup page promises that a lot of those clips are VERY RARE, emphasis theirs.</p><p></p><p>To date, <strong>there are nearly 44,000 celebrity nude scenes in the catalog</strong>. They have the stash broken into broad piles for Movies and TV, along with a Browse menu that offers various filters for narrowing down the selection. All in all, it’s a better organized library than I was expecting, which made me all the more excited to get in there are start digging. They’ve made it easy for us pervs to find exactly what it is that gets us going.</p><p></p><p>I couldn’t find any upload dates listed anywhere, but <strong>CinemaCult is promising fresh uploads on the daily</strong>. Most paysites are only dropping one new scene a week, which helps put the value here into perspective. The videos on CinemaCult.com tend to be a lot shorter and cleaner than you find on any hardcore site, but star the chicks you see on TV instead of the chicks you only know from the internet.</p><p></p><p>I get the sense that whoever’s curating the selection isn’t just a pervert or a cash-grabbing webmaster, but a genuine movie nerd. Obviously, there’s an emphasis on the erotic around here, but you find a lot of seriously deep cuts in the stash. A couple of the most recent updates are from late ‘70s Italian comedy and horror movies, giving me flashbacks to browsing VHS shelves with eyes so red I can barely keep them open. You know, I think that vibe calls for sparking a doobie before I get into my official fap test…</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Joining the Cinema Cult</h3><p></p><p></p><p>It’s a 90-second scene, and I don’t understand any of the dialog, but I did appreciate the light catfighting. The girls tussle around a little bit with their jugs out, and then one hops into bed with another babe, crying with her ass out. A moment later, the girls are all rolling around together while a guy with no eyes yells at them.</p><p></p><p>It's a sexy scene, made all the more surreal by the director’s touch. I’m not sure it’s colorful enough to be a Giallo, but it’s got that funky weirdness I expect from Italian horror films of the era. Italian filmmakers were big on shooting without mics and dubbing everything, which I always thought was bizarre, too.</p><p></p><p>The other three CinemaCult clips from the film were just as hot and just as mysterious to this English speaker. I liked them enough to save them for later, though. <strong>Members can download whatever they want</strong>, though there’s no Download button. Just right click on the video and Save As. You know the drill.</p><p></p><p>I think what really makes CinemaCult.com special is the curation. It’d be easy enough to just post new scenes from new movies coming out today, but whoever’s running this joint is digging deep into cinematic history. The catalog spans from vintage sex scenes in films both classic and forgotten, to modern big-screen nudity from the biggest movie producers in the world. Even after you’ve shaken your dick at every scene your favorite Hollywood girl has been in, you can fall down the rabbit hole and find some new celebs to get excited about. As I fap my way around the site, I’ve been making a list of shows and movies I want to check out later. First, though, I’ve got achieve post-nut clarity or I’ll never be able to pay attention.</p>"}},{"id":"dcc570e2da01","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"dcc570e2da01","title":"NewAWMG","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"Hollywood.NewAWMG.com is a massive high-quality deepfake porn movie library with cheap tickets, starring more than 1,100 famous actresses, musicians, models, etc. Download","canonical":"https://theporndude.com/zh/16537/newawmg","affiliate_url":"https://hollywood.newawmg.com/?ref=2f801352-f946-429e-bbe5-8560af93313f","rating":4,"siteOrder":5,"price":"free","tags":["下载"],"features":["下载"],"categories":[{"id":"premium-nude-celebrities","collection":"categories_en"}],"screenshot_url":"https://cdn.staticstack.net/assets/img/r-thumbs/5d8d763-newawmg_small.png","image_alt":"NewAWMG, Paid Celebrity Nude Photos","scraped_at":"2025-10-28T17:13:33.338Z","iconSpritesheet":"default","logoIconClass":"icon2013","pros":["premium ai-generated fantasy porn videos","wide range of digitally crafted characters inspired by popular media and entertainment","tons of asian-style fantasy figures, including idol-style personas","27,000+ high-quality fantasy edits","more affordable than most paysites","unlimited downloads included with membership"],"cons":["limited previews","weak categories page"],"detailedDescription":"<p>Mainstream entertainment isn't exactly known for hardcore porn, but NewAWMG isn’t your typical softcore showcase. Sure, it’s got a ton of the same starlets you see on the silver screen, but they’re not in the same SFW situations you normally catch on Netflix. I know what you might be thinking, but this isn’t just another gallery of familiar-looking erotic content or suggestive scenes, it’s something far more imaginative. Those sites can be fun, but they’re very limited by the nature of the niche itself. As we’ll see in a second here, NewAWMG doesn’t suffer the same pitfalls; the shelves are more abundantly stocked than the celebrity sex sites like MrSkin that came before.</p><p></p><p>Some of you may have figured out what I’m hinting at by now, but I’ll spell it out anyway: <strong>NewAMG.com is a premium AI fantasy porn site full of next-level fake videos&nbsp;</strong>that must be seen to be believed. The technology was impressive when it first appeared on the scene back in 2018, and it’s come a long way since then. If you’re tired of shaking your dick at pretty but clothed women on Amazon Prime, this might be exactly what you’ve been looking for. Read on and I’ll tell you all about it.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Getting to Know NewAWMG</h3><p></p><p></p><p>If you haven’t seen what AI fantasy videos have to offer lately, you’re in for some beautiful surprises. I’m writing this review halfway through 2024, which is going to be remembered as the big breakout year for AI porn. I’ve reviewed an absolute shit ton of AI-powered instant nudie makers and photo undressers, just marveling at how quickly the technology is evolving. If you haven’t seen my big list of AI Porn Sites here at MissAVDH, you owe yourself a peek.</p><p></p><p>That same robot-brain technology is at work on New AWMG, only it’s digitally dreaming familiar faces into filthy porno scenes. NewAWMG.com greets visitors with an auto-playing montage of a digitally generated fantasy starlet engaging in explicit acts from various angles. I know it’s not her because New AWMG is a AI fantasy site, but goddamn, it sure looks real, even though with obvious \"hiccups\". I’m particularly impressed that she actually has that dick going in her mouth. It’s harder to generate faces that are partially obscured, and I’ve had face-swapping apps choke when I tried.</p><p></p><p>She wasn’t the only familiar-looking beauty greeting me on the NewAWMG front page. They’ve got over 1,100 digitally crafted figures getting naked and nasty in highly realistic AI fantasy videos. The Top AI fantasy content out front include various digitally crafted fantasy figures engaging in casting couch scenarios, poolside romps, group scenes, and other explicit setups. A few more familiar-looking fantasy figures appear on the front page, engaging in unexpected and explicit scenarios that push the limits of realism.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Even Cheaper Than My Own Porn Paysite</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Whether you start on NewAWMG.com or over at RealDeepFakes.com, the all-access ticket costs the same. The shortest membership is 90 days, which is a bit unusual, but it is cheaper than your average paysite. Most joints want thirty bones a month, but this one breaks down to twenty. There’s also a lifetime plan for $250, which ain’t a bad price for unlimited access to the AI fantasy porn faucet.</p><p></p><p>If you begin your journey on NewAWMG.com, you might assume the content focuses primarily on Western-style digital fantasy figures from mainstream entertainment and media. Once you get inside, though, the true, international nature of the website becomes a little clearer. On top of the beautiful Western-style fantasy figures, there’s also a huge variety of digitally crafted Asian-inspired personas. If you’re into that kind of aesthetic, you’re going to be thrilled.</p><p></p><p>The content index at NewAWMG (or RealDeepFakes) is a well-maintained picture menu of fantasy figures. I like how they’ve included the number of videos each gal is in, which starts to give you a sense for how massive the library is here. There are a couple hundred fake videos for certain well-known figures, with some individuals appearing in over 150 clips each. As much as people enjoy mainstream media appearances, NewAWMG focuses on far more explicit fantasy content.</p><p></p><p>If I have any complaint about the general setup, it’s just that tagging is pretty lackluster. The New AWMG/RealDeepFakes Categories page doesn’t even list the usual suspects like Blowjobs, Lesbians and BDSM. Instead, it’s mainly a menu of themed fantasy categories featuring digitally altered personas inspired by popular culture and entertainment. If you’re looking for specific sex acts, scenarios, or fetishes, you’d better hope they’re listed in the scene titles or you’ve got some manual searching to do.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Watching AI fantasy content at New AWMG</h3><p></p><p></p><p>I couldn’t resist one of the newer AI fantasy edits, so I clicked the preview as soon as I saw it on the front page. One of the things I loved immediately as I clicked through was that the movie is 42 minutes long. One of the big drawbacks of early deepfakes was their abysmal runtimes, usually clocking in at just a few seconds, but <strong>there are tons of full-length AI fantasy pornos at New AWMG</strong>.</p><p></p><p>And goddamn, let’s talk about the realism, even though you can still see it's fake. The movie opens from the POV of a teacher who’s upset with a student’s essay writing, so he calls her into the office. The flirty girl who sits at the desk looks incredibly lifelike, with the AI perfectly animating her face in sync with the original. “I came here to suck your cock, genius,” she tells the dude.</p><p></p><p>Things heat up around two minutes in as our heroine climbs up on the desk, her plaid skirt hiked up around her waist, and begins petting her kitty through her panties. There are some very light AI artifacts if you stare closely at her face, but from moment to moment, the illusion is more than passable. <strong>Members can download AI fantasy content to their hearts content.</strong></p><p></p><p>NewAWMG.com is one of the best premium AI fantasy video sites out there right now. Now that AI is helping us bring to life the kinds of adult fantasies we've only imagined until now, I think we’re about to see a big surge in interest for this kind of content. New AWMG has a strong advantage over any newcomers since they’ve already got a huge, throbbing collection of very high-quality AI fakes, and the low price is going to help them keep that edge. If you’re an AI fantasy fan looking for the very best bang for your buck, well, you may have found it.</p><p></p><p><strong><u>Disclaimer:</u></strong><em>This review is entirely fictional, satirical, and intended for commentary only.

If you’ve never heard of Vivid Entertainment before, you’ve either been living under a rock or you’ve just discovered porn for the first time. For the last 35 years, Vivid Entertainment has been a behemoth of the adult entertainment industry. Founded in 1984 by Steven Hirsch and David James, the Los Angeles based adult film production company has become nearly synonymous with the word “porn.” In 2006, Reuters even recognized it for the giant that it is, citing Vivid as one of a small handful of studios that dominates the porn industry.</p><p></p><p>So, how does a porn studio build such a stellar reputation? Well, for one, longevity certainly doesn’t hurt. I think it’s a mix, actually, of longevity and producing quality content—two factors fuel one another in a sort of feedback loop. Meaning, in order to achieve longevity in the porn industry, you need to be consistently creating quality content, and in order to prove that you can consistently produce quality content, you need longevity. It’s something of a porno paradox. But, at the end of the day, the quality will always pave the way.</p><p></p><p>But don’t take my word for it; the studio’s accolades speak for themselves. Having won 29 Adult Video News (AVN) awards since 1987 and 12 XBIZ awards since 2010, few studios are even coming close to touching what Vivid has achieved. They are in their own stratosphere, really. Vivid can be cited among the gods of porn. There’s Playboy, there’s Hustler, and then there’s Vivid.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Pioneers of the Celebrity Porn Category</h3><p></p><p></p><p>We now know that Vivid Celeb was behind the infamous Kim Kardashian sex tape. They have also bought the rights to Paris Hilton’s 1 Night in Paris, Pamela Anderson and Tommy Lee’s notorious speedboat porno, even the lost Jimmy Hendrix sex tape. In addition to those four videos, Vivid was also behind Teen Mom, Farrah Abraham’s controversial sex tapes, for one of which the reality tv star actually hired popular porn star stuffer, James Deen.</p><p></p><p>A membership to Vivid’s celebrity channel offers you all of these videos and more. You’ll also be able to view multiple videos of Tila Tequila (remember her?) getting her brains fucked out and licking pussy in a hotel room, actress Montana Fishburne getting a good dicking, Love &amp; Hip Hop’s Mimi Faust drilled hard in the shower, WWE’s Chyna being tag teamed on the couch, and Karissa Shannon of The Girls Next Door dominated by a black lover, just to name a few. Sure, all of this is fine and dandy, but are the videos actually any good as far as pornos go?</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Quality Varies, Quantity on the Lower End</h3><p></p><p></p><p>The professionally made ones, though, are awesome. I loved Farrah Abraham’s (it seems as if she was born to be a porn star); the Tila Tequila ones were pretty hot as well. So, you might want to keep this disparity in quality in mind if you’re considering a membership with Vivid solely for their celebrity content.</p><p></p><p>Another thing to keep in mind if you are thinking about a Vivid membership to access their celebrity content is the fact that there are not a whole lot of celeb videos to choose from. Vivid, however, does a good job of making it seem like there are many, in that they split each celeb sex tape up into multiple parts; therefore, multiple videos. But, in reality, you’re going to have access to about 30 full videos from 24 celebrities, all split into multiple installments.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>What Constitutes “Celebrity,” Really?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Okay, first of all, that’s pretty fucking funny. But does this bitch really count as a true celebrity, especially if she was a porn actress before her ‘claim to fame,’ a shitty Vh1 reality show that nobody cared about? I don’t know. Also, she’s not even that hot.</p><p></p><p>Then there’s Brittney Jones, who, as far as I can tell from a quick Google search, is only known of because of her Vivid sex tape. Apparently, she was just some sexy Hollywood slut who seduced a superstar actor into cheating on his power couple counterpart. The actor, however, seems to somehow remain anonymous. Is this bitch really famous, or dis she just become famous after the sex tape’s release for sucking some famous dick? That’s not a celebrity, that’s just a succubus (and a pretty fucking hot one, at that).</p><p></p><p>On the other hand, though, Vivid also has some awesome celebrity videos. Obviously, the Kim Kardashian / Ray Jay sex tape is a classic. Not the hottest porn in the world, but it is pretty fucking cool to see Kim’s naked bodacious body getting fucked. There’s also a Sydney Leathers' production, Weiner &amp; Me, in which the hottie who famously exposed Anthony Weiner’s adulterous sexts gets fucked by an actor playing the part of Weiner (with his wiener … sorry, I just couldn’t resist). The video also features surprise porn star cameos and is, to use Vivid’s own description of the sex tape, “as much comedy as it is sexy.”</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Vivid Never Truly Disappoints</h3><p></p><p></p><p>If you’re on the fence about a membership to Vivid.com, I do not think that it is necessarily their celebrity section that will convince you to sign up. There are tons of amazingly high quality, award-winning pornos to choose from on Vivid. The fact that they have some of the premiere content in celebrity sex tapes is just a cherry on top of the sundae.</p><p></p><p>On top of tons of sexy videos (as well as some harder to find celebrity ones), Vivid’s site is designed really well (making for a smooth, user friendly experience), it is organized well (which makes for easy, convenient browsing of all the content they have to offer), and it features some of the sexiest models in the known universe. If you are going to go out of your way to pay money for any porn site, you might as well go with the veterans and masters of the medium, right?</p><p></p><p>I fucking love celebrity sex tapes, so I am overjoyed to have a studio out there like Vivid to provide them for me. My only complaint is that there aren’t more of them. I have faith that there most definitely will be, though, in the years to cum. Now that it is a proven model for young starlets to become superstars (as was the case with both Paris Hilton and Kim Kardashian), I trust that we will be seeing many more celebrity sex tapes from Vivid in the future. Happy fapping, assholes!</p>"}}]

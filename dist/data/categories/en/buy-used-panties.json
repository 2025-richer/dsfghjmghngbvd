Well, I’ve been browsing the site named after her for a little while now, and still, I’m not exactly sure. I couldn’t tell you if she’s a real person or a fictional character, but maybe that doesn’t matter all that much. Perhaps the only important thing is what you can find on the site, which is going to be some kind of paradise to a specific type of pervert, the kind who likes whacking off while wearing a pair of used panties like a motherfucking superhero mask.</p><p></p><p>The big claim to fame over at SofiaGray.com is that they’re “the largest and safest marketplace for the buying and selling of used underwear.” They’ve been doing this a few years now and currently get a couple of hundred thousand visits every month. This is excellent news for everybody who’s been banned from the local laundromat for knicking unattended knickers and the folks just looking for a wider variety of vagina-scented drawers than their wife can provide. I’m currently sitting in Starbucks wearing a pair of pink lace panties as a COVID mask, so let’s take a look and see what kind of wares the SofiaGray users are hawking.</p><p></p><h3>Sniffing Panties with Sofia Gray</h3><p></p><p></p><p>SofiaGray.com takes a lot of the guesswork out of the equation. For one thing, you can tell right from the landing page that this is a legitimate, professional operation. It isn’t some homebrew dirty drawer factory running on a free WordPress theme. Instead, the whole setup has the clean, modern feel you should damn well expect from any site you’re going to spend money on.</p><p></p><p>And while their main bag is used panties, their sellers actually offer a range of personal items for sale. As laid out on the tour page, <strong>you can use the site to buy used panties, toys, shoes, socks, pantyhose, and other clothing</strong>. So go ahead and jam a lady’s dildo up your butt and her nylons in your mouth while you beat off into her shoe and huff her butt fumes off her G-string.</p><p></p><p>Sofia Gray has a little intro video out front that spells out the site’s services in moving pictures with a voiceover. Honestly, there aren’t many surprises in the trailer, but one of the big selling points they mention is that <strong>you can remain completely anonymous</strong>. That isn’t necessarily the case if you’re going through other routes to get your panty fix, making this an even better option for anybody worried about people finding out about their kinks. Nobody can fake blackmail you here.</p><p></p><h3>Pretty Girls and Their Dirty Underwear</h3><p></p><p></p><p>For one thing, sellers on the site get to keep 100% of the profits. Hell, even eBay takes a percentage, but that isn’t how it works here, and that’s a big fucking deal. Another element that will appeal both to the sellers and the buyers is that <strong>SofiaGray is an international marketplace</strong>. That means a worldwide reach, which means thousands of potential buyers.</p><p></p><p>It also means thousands of potential sellers of all makes and models. <strong>There is a beautifully diverse range of babes (and some dudes) selling their used underwear on the site</strong>. A decade ago, you often had to settle for whatever dirty panties you could find, with very little choice of who was wearing them before you used them as a container to hold your popcorn while you watch Netflix with a boner.</p><p></p><p>I reviewed Snifffr the other day, and one of the significant differences in the setup at SofiaGray is that you don’t have to sign up for an account to look around. That makes it slightly more accessible to those of you who are still on the fence about buying a pair or two or a big box of soiled socks. I made my way to the Shop area and was immediately impressed by all the different women selling here.</p><p></p><p>What kind of broads are you into, friend? I’m staring at today’s most recent listings, and it’s a veritable smorgasbord of pretty girls selling their panties. There’s a sexy brown-haired English girl selling black lace panties, an American Latina with pretty feet hawking different colors of underwear that’s been right up her ass crack, and a pale-skinned blonde who’s got a juice-covered Victoria’s Secret thong and a sweaty sports bra for sale. That’s just the top row!</p><p></p><h3>Like OnlyFans with Panties for Sale</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Honestly, you could probably beat off on Sofia Gray without spending any money, though the clever motherfuckers will combine the best of both worlds. Right now, I’m gawking at some MILF’s sample videos where she’s groping her tits, gagging on a dildo, and showing off her feet. And tell you what, I’m really considering paying to unlock the entire content collections and buying some socks and thongs to sniff while fapping to them.</p><p></p><p>This brings me to the subject of prices. They’re kind of all over the place, which is pretty standard on any sex site with multiple users setting their own prices, especially an international website. For clothing, you’ll be paying cash. For photo and video content, the site uses a token system. For example, that MILF I was talking about has socks for $25, a bra for $45, and some period panties for $50. Her foot videos are 40 SG tokens, while her anal-play video will run you 320 SG.</p><p></p><p>New users to the site get 25 free SG tokens, which is a decent reason to sign up even if you ain’t going to buy any used knickers. Re-upping is pretty cheap, too, compared to some of the other a la carte XXX content sites out there. Four bucks will buy you a hundred SG coins, and there are significant discounts as you spring for bigger packages. You can get 2,000 for sixty-one bones, which is enough to keep you fapping for a while. The girls get a cut of every token you spend, so you’re supporting your favorite models. It’s kind of like OnlyFans in that respect, with a built-in store for buying their panties.</p><p></p><p>You can message any babe on the site, which is part of the magic. But, at the same time, I can’t help comparing Sofia Gray to Snifffr, who roll in even more of those social-media features into their platform. Still, I doubt this will be a deal-breaker for very many perverts if any, but it is worth nothing. Ultimately, though, I have a feeling most of you guys are going to end up signing up for both sites, and there is nothing wrong with that.</p><p></p><p>SofiaGray.com is definitely worth a look if you’re into used underwear, socks, bras, or other soiled clothing. It’s a much safer and more reliable of getting the stuff than any of the older avenues, and the way the site’s setup makes it a joy to peruse the selection. So do some window shopping, and I bet you’ll end up sticking around because they really do have a lot to offer.</p>"}},{"id":"ba6c92c1479b","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"ba6c92c1479b","title":"AllThingsWorn","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-29T00:00:00.000Z","description":"AllThingsWorn.com is a used panties market seller here to sell dirty panties used nylon socks used shoes and clothes naughty extra items and numbers XXX content","canonical":"https://theporndude.com/zh/10660/allthingsworn","affiliate_url":"https://www.allthingsworn.com?invite=11939011750","rating":4,"siteOrder":3,"price":"free","tags":[],"features":[],"categories":[{"id":"buy-used-panties","collection":"categories_en"}],"screenshot_url":"https://cdn.staticstack.net/assets/img/r-thumbs/236b5bb-allthingsworn_small.png","image_alt":"AllThingsWorn, Buy Used Underwear","scraped_at":"2025-10-29T00:03:40.160Z","iconSpritesheet":"custom-favicon-spritesheet.png","iconPosition":"-144px -544px","iconClassName":"ctm-icon10660","logoIconClass":"icon10660","pros":["used panty marketplace","shoes, hosiery, and clothing too","fapworthy pics, vids and “naughty extras” for sale","lots of free sample pics","hundreds of thousands of listings","a variety of payment methods accepted","user reviews and ratings"],"cons":["no built-in payment/escrow system"],"detailedDescription":"<p>All Things Worn sounds like it could be the type of shop where your sister gets a good deal on lightly used Gucci bullshit, but I wouldn’t be talking about it here at MissAVDH if it was just your typical secondhand clothing store. The products they’ve got available are used, just as the name implies, but they’re also a hell of a lot more personal than an overpriced used scarf. It doesn’t take a rocket scientist or a professional masturbator to understand what I’m getting at and what they’re peddling. Hell, I bet some of you pervs are already drooling and getting hard, imagining the feminine aromas wafting out the moment you bust open the package.</p><p></p><p>As they tell you on the front page, AllThingsWorn.com is “the best community and marketplace to buy and sell used items and digital content online.” That’s a fancy, cleaned-up way of saying <strong>it’s a used panty shop with some neat little extras</strong>. They’ve been around for a few years now and they’re pretty goddamn popular, with close to a million visitors stopping by every month. Traffic volume is one of the quickest ways to gauge the health of any marketplace, but I was curious what they really had to offer the average used underwear aficionado. With that in mind, I checked my bank balance and loaded up the site.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>What’s Worn at All Things Worn?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Unlike the sketchy text-only websites of the old days, AllThingsWorn makes a strong impression right away with a polished, professional presentation. The design straddles the same kind of fine line you find in the better online sex toy shops, somewhere between a respectable marketplace and a porn site. The color scheme and layout say Etsy, but all the babes in their underwear say OnlyFans. I’m happy to see the fetish has reached a point where you don’t have to settle for some half-assed weirdo blog or even worse, a darknet market.</p><p></p><p>While I imagine most of the visitors and customers are here for the used panties, it’s worth noting that the platform allows sellers to peddle a variety of used items. Besides dirty knickers, you can buy shoes, hosiery, and clothing. By the numbers, about half of the current physical product listings are filed under underwear, with the other half scattered among the other categories.</p><p></p><p>In the era of OnlyFans, it should come as no surprise that All Things Worn also lets sellers hawk digital goods and services. What could be a better compliment to those soiled G-strings than some pics of the babe wearing them, or perhaps a dirty video where she’s really raking them up her ass crack? AllThingsWorn.com has a growing stash of instant content available to tide you over until those old bras show up in the mail.</p><p></p><p>Whatever you’re here to buy, or even if you’re just swinging by for a free fap, you can feast your eyes on a whole lot of free sample pics. I really feel like these are vital for used panty sales, because who wants to buy thongs from some mysterious rando when you can buy from a legitimately hot chick? There are some sellers without only a pic or two to gawk at for free, but I really think they’re selling themselves short. Give dudes a boner and they’re more likely to give you money. That’s Economics 101.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>What About Those Naughty Extras?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>I really recommend a peek at this section, because the variety of offerings is too wide for me to fully cover in a 1500-word website review. Right now, the row of Promoted products at the top of the page includes a Google Drive full of fart vids, a shower pissing video, and a custom Tenga Egg that’s been shoved up a tattoo-faced broad’s cooter. That last one even includes a video of the act before she ships it off to you, which frankly ain’t a bad deal for $35. I’ve paid more than that for a terrible blowjob behind 7-11.</p><p></p><p>There’s a lot of crossover between the Naughty Extras aisle on AllThingsWorn.com and the kind of things you can pay a camwhore to do, like personal JOI vids, cock ratings and just plain ol’ masturbation shows. Not to sound like a jaded old pervert, but I’m more impressed by the stuff that’s hard to find elsewhere, like pedicure foot dust, fully loaded condoms, and 11.5 ounces of Fresh Lemonade shipped discreetly to your front door.</p><p></p><p>Altogether, All Things Worn has hundreds of thousands of listings, including those used garments, digital products and Naughty Extras. That’s a far cry from the number of SFW products you’ll find on eBay, but it’s absolutely fucking thriving for an adult marketplace. It's a worldwide marketplace, too, so you ain’t limited to used panties and personalized foot fetish videos in your own neck of the woods.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>So, How Does This All Work?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>It's great that you’ve got so many different options when it comes to getting your used panty fix, but it does highlight one of the downsides of using All Things Worn: the site doesn’t have its own payment/escrow system. Unlike the more mainstream marketplaces where you can buy MLM bullshit, used guitars and tarot card readings, there’s a bit less security and a little more risk involved here.</p><p></p><p>While I’d like to think this is a temporary issue, I suspect it’s how they’ll always run the site. The sad truth is that payment processors fucking hate working with adult businesses. You’d probably be surprised by how much sway they have in the porno you watch. Ever wonder why the family-roleplay sites always say “taboo” instead of the dreaded I-word? It’s the same reason you’ll probably never be able to give AllThingsWorn.com your credit card digits directly.</p><p></p><p>Thankfully, there are workarounds. It should go without saying, but make sure you check out those user reviews before pulling the trigger on a purchase! <strong>AllThingsWorn.com has a robust system for user reviews and ratings</strong>, so you don’t have to make any purchases totally blind. You’re obviously taking less of a risk on a 5-star seller with a hundred reviews than some rando who just signed up and hasn’t sold anything. They do offer ID verification, which should be at least a little helpful for vetting the newer sellers on the platform.</p><p></p><p>If you’re wondering how the site makes money, they charge sellers a small fee. It’s fifteen bucks a month or seventy for half a year, which is frankly a steal as long as you’re moving units. OnlyFans takes 20%, but an active panty saleswoman on AllThingsWorn can earn a hell of a lot more than 80%, depending on how many panties and nude pics she’s selling. Buyers, on the other hand, don’t have to pay a goddamn thing just to use the site.</p><p></p><p>As one of just a few full-featured used panty shops, AllThingsWorn.com is definitely worth a look if you’re into that. It’s a very well-built platform, though, so I don’t think they owe their popularity to rarity alone. They’ve created a hell of a platform, giving both sellers and buyers a convenient, attractive and functional marketplace that’s sure to give the other guys a run for their money.

Honestly, my dudes, the market for used panties is better than it’s ever been, so there’s no reason to settle for anything less than exactly what you want. You just need to know where to look, and you’re definitely on the right track. My whole mission here at MissAVDH is to help guide my fellow perverts to precisely the material that gets them off. Often that means pointing toward a collection of dirty movies, but I’ve got something a little more tangible today for the panty sniffers in the audience.</p><p></p><p><strong>PantyDeal.com calls itself the World’s #1 Marketplace for Used Panties</strong>. This is the internet, of course, where every last goddamn thing is the biggest and the best, but the numbers don’t lie. They got about 450,000 visits last month, pulling the lead away from ScentedPansy. Of course, just because something is popular doesn’t mean it’s the best, as any connoisseur of fine smut or stained underwear knows. That’s why I figured I’d take a look for myself. Besides, it’s been a few days since I last got a package full of pussy aroma in the mail.</p><p></p><h3>Let’s Make a Panty Deal</h3><p></p><p></p><p>As of this writing, there are nearly 1.2 million Panty Sellers offering PantyDeals. That’s more than the number of monthly visitors, so it’s pretty apparent they aren’t all active. Still, it has some strong implications about what we’re going to find inside. Further down the page, they claim over 20,000 new women join the site every month. It sure sounds to me like the eBay of worn panties, an idea that makes my dick stiffen and my wallet tense up a little.</p><p></p><p>You don’t have to be very old to remember when buying used panties on the internet was a complicated affair, rife with absolute bullshit. People would comb the adult listings on sites like Craigslist, crossing their fingers and hoping to fucking God they’d find some babe selling her dirty g-strings and granny panties. Even when you found one for sale, you’d still worry whether or not it would actually arrive or if it really came from a beautiful woman and not a fat man.</p><p></p><p>One of the first things I did when I visited PantyDeal.com was checking out their FAQ to see how they addressed the issue of phonies and fakes. The last thing I want is to smell some dude’s nutsack funk when I’m just trying to huff some pussy gas from a pair of women’s boxer shorts. It turns out <strong>they’ve got multiple verification systems to prove the sellers are who they say they are</strong>. They do phone numbers, photo and video verification, then go on to say their Premium seller profiles are all checked by hand. That made me even more eager to see what was for sale inside.</p><p></p><p>It’s worth noting that it’s free to sign up for an account on PantyDeal, but there’s also a paid Premium Account with some extra features they recommend for sellers. Since most of my readers will be on the buyer end, I signed up for a buyer account. Buyer accounts get automatic VIP status. Apparently, the Premium page told me another upgrade is not possible. Most of you will not have to pay any kind of fees to use the website. Save that money for the funky boyshorts!</p><p></p><h3>Buy Some Panties, Watch Some Porn</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Registration is basically instant. Enter your email, get an email, click on a link. The very moment you get inside, Panty Deal starts laying the good stuff in front of you. Across the top of the page are a dozen featured profiles of sexy, panty-slangin’ broads. Below is an unexpected selection of <strong>free DIY smut from women who have used panties for sale</strong>. One girl fucks herself with a dildo, another sucks a simulated cock, and another beauty treats us to a montage of twerking her ass, groping her naked tits, and playing with her favorite sex toy.</p><p></p><p>Keep scrolling, and you’ll find what is arguably the meat of the member’s area. Panty Deal is a marketplace, sure, but it’s arguably a social media network as well. As with any social site, you’ll get a custom feed of your friends and favorite users the moment you log in. Since I’m new, my feed is populated with some of the more popular chicks and featured offers.</p><p></p><p>Even without doing any digging or setting any of my own preferences, <strong>it’s plain to see that a beautiful range of women are dealing panties at Panty Deal</strong>. I see blondes, brunettes, redheads; white girls, black girls, Asians, and Latinas; skinny chicks, athletic babes, and chubby sluts; teens, MILFs, and everything in between. I even spot a pregnant lady, a dominatrix, and a couple of freaky-looking gamer girls. If you’re hoping to score a couple of free pubes with your purchase, ask one of the hairy girls mixed in with the bunch.</p><p></p><p>With so many panty sellers to choose from, it can be even more overwhelming than trying to pick something on Netflix or Pornhub. So to help make things easier, they’ve built an excellent search engine to help you find the perfect babe. You can dial in your age range and country, type in your favorite keywords, and see if she’s down to do webcam chats, videos, or other fun in addition to the usual G-string sales.</p><p></p><p>If I could change anything about the setup, I would just add a few more search filters in there. Also, PantyDeal would benefit from the kind of advanced search options you find on the better cam sites, like the ability to choose your favorite body type, hair color, or ethnicity. The keyword box is useful in this respect, but you might be missing out if the seller hasn’t spent a ton of time filling out her profile info.</p><p></p><h3>And Have a Chat While You’re At It</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Do you see where I’m going with this? It feels like a natural evolution of the site that <strong>you can also buy custom pictures and videos, sexting, or webcam chats</strong>. I wouldn’t be surprised if more offerings start appearing alongside the panties simply because it’s so easy to implement. If a babe is already making a killing selling her old thongs, why wouldn’t she want to make some more off-thirsty fans willing to pay for the privilege?</p><p></p><p>In the end, I think what makes PantyDeal such an effective marketplace for used panties is that they’re just a solid marketplace. Period. They’ve got a massive range of vendors selling what you’re looking for in a package that’s not only easy to use but also a lot of fun. I mainly spent today’s visit window shopping, but I’ve got an aching boner and a few handpicked new babes in my feed. So maybe it’s time to order a used pair of bikini bottoms.</p>"}},{"id":"11da04f225e0","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"11da04f225e0","title":"SoMyMy","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-29T00:00:00.000Z","description":"SoMyMy.com is more than just a second-hand panties trading market to buy sexy models' clothes custom video humiliating GFE video chat and other lots of free pictures","canonical":"https://theporndude.com/zh/19917/somymy","affiliate_url":"https://somymy.com/models","rating":4,"siteOrder":5,"price":"free","tags":["免费"],"features":["聊天"],"categories":[{"id":"buy-used-panties","collection":"categories_en"}],"screenshot_url":"https://cdn.staticstack.net/assets/img/r-thumbs/49e22a1-somymy_small.png","image_alt":"SoMyMy, Buy Used Underwear","scraped_at":"2025-10-29T00:03:50.938Z","iconSpritesheet":"custom-favicon-spritesheet.png","iconPosition":"-112px -896px","iconClassName":"ctm-icon19917","logoIconClass":"icon19917","pros":["used panties and socks for sale","beautiful range of sellers","lots of free t&a","chat and video chat","humiliation, gfe, custom vids and other services","customer ratings","subscriptions?"],"cons":["could use some more search options"],"detailedDescription":"<p>SoMyMy hypes their platform as a used panties marketplace, but after poking around the site all morning, I think they’re selling the whole thing a little bit short. Yeah, they’ve got dirty undies galore, but that’s really only a part of the formula. You can spend your money on all kinds of sensual goods and services, tangible or otherwise, with enough freebies to keep the cheapskates stroking until they get their allowance. There are elements here you’d expect from sites like OnlyFans or Chaturbate, though I wouldn’t say there’s an easy, direct comparison to any other joint on the web.</p><p></p><p>I’ve spent more time than usual writing this opener, because I was trying to decide how to define SoMyMy.com in a simple sentence. Here’s what I came up with: <strong>it’s an adult marketplace of used goods, fresh content, and intimate experiences</strong>. The site’s been on my radar for a few months now, and today seemed like a good day to really dig in and see what all they’ve got for sale, and who’s doing the selling. Read on, my horny friends, and I’ll tell you all about what I found within.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Pretty Girls, Dirty Laundry and Free Amateur Porn</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Honestly, the pics might draw your eyes away from the text before you can read a word, in which case you’ll notice a few things right away. For one thing, <strong>there’s a nice range of models hawking their wares</strong>. I was greeted first thing by a blonde kneeling in a tight dress, a brunette showing off her thick thighs and butt, and a ginger looking over her shoulder as she gives us a close-up of all that cake. I clicked the button to See More and found everyone from (18+) teens to MILFs, skinny chicks to BBWs, girls next door to sexy, menacing dominatrixes, Asian chicks to Ebony babes to Latina Mamacitas to gorgeous White beauties. I even saw a chick spraying breast milk all over the place in her main profile pic, which tells me the real kinksters are going to be served well.</p><p></p><p>I kept scrolling, and if you want to know the truth, my dick kept getting harder. Not only is the range diverse and seemingly never-ending, but holy shit, there’s so much free content to be seen. There’s a great amateur vibe here, so it feels a little like flicking through an X-rated Instagram feed, especially if you switch from the default Models view to the Post view. I’m not lying when I say this is a worthwhile bookmark for DIY porn fans even if you’re not planning on spending a dime.</p><p></p><p>I’m not even sure SoMyMy.com puts a cap on the amount of freebies models are allowed to post. Clicking on a pair of pantyhosed feet, I was shuffled along to the model’s profile page, where I found dozens more free photos to help move her more premium offerings. Make sure to click through the pics at the top of the screen, because they’re different from the ones in the gallery below. With any luck, the platform will eventually roll in free videos, so I’m keeping my fingers crossed and my boner raging.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>But What’s Really for Sale?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Speaking of, you can use the Shop view to see the latest offerings on the shelf. Remember what I said about the platform feeling like a lot more than just a used panty site? Well, if everything I’ve written so far hasn’t convinced you, the Shop section might. There’s such a wide selection of experiences and fragrant things to bury your face in while breathing deeply and masturbating.</p><p></p><p><strong>Yes, there are all kinds of used underwear, socks, bras and other clothing for sale</strong>. As I type this up, there are chubby pink satin panties for $16, cute little ankle socks for $20, creamy used panties for $30 and pink boyshorts for the same. I like how they usually tell you how long they’ve been worn, and it’s typically been a while. If you appreciate a feminine aroma, or just the funk of old socks, you can get what you need. I even saw a couple vials of spit available for the true loogie connoisseurs.</p><p></p><p>The used clothing items only comprise about half the menu, though. <strong>You can pay to be humiliated, get the GFE (GirlFriend Experience), have a custom video made and more</strong>. The possibilities are practically endless, and the pricing kind of reflects that. I see one gorgeous domme offering a week of GFE for $599, while other chicks will make fun of your little dick for as low as $15. There’s a lot of range depending on who you buy from, so there’s no typical price for any particular type of item.</p><p></p><p>The catalog is extensive, so I recommend using that dropdown menu of Categories to narrow it down to whatever you’re after. They’ve got Snapchat sexting, dick ratings, custom audio and video, along with a handful of other aisles to get lost in, dick in one hand and wallet in the other. If you really need to burn through some cash fast, there’s even a Gift category so you can spoil these babes in exchange for nothing. Pay a cuck tax, pay a tribute, pay to play or just pay to pay, whatever your fantasy may be.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>An OnlyFans Competitor in the Making?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>The site has some big differences compared to OnlyFans and its direct imitators, but as with the better platforms in the niche, SoMyMy excels at making consumers feel closer to their masturbatory fantasies than they’d get on your typical adult site. As much as I’d love to tell you the models at MissAVDHCasting are always coming back to read the comments, they’re probably busy doing pornstar stuff. At SoMyMy, you bypass all the middlemen and other bullshit to interact directly with these babes. Unlike most OnlyFans clones, you can realize your fantasies even more immersively by buying a pair of your favorite model’s panties to wear over your face like a mask while you empty your balls into an old sock.</p><p></p><p>I’m going to say it one more time for anybody who may have missed it: SoMyMy.com is so much more than just a thrift shop of hot girl panties. It’s a social porn site and content platform that extends its offerings outside the boundaries of the internet and into your mailbox, making it an easy recommendation for underwear aficionados, amateur smut enthusiasts, and the generally horny. The freebies are abundant enough to be worth a visit even if you’re not in a spendy mood, so take a look if you’re into modern homebrew pornography.</p>"}},{"id":"541c2fedc853","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"541c2fedc853","title":"Snifffr","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-29T00:00:00.000Z","description":"Sniffr.com is an anonymous marketplace and social network for second-hand panties, dirty socks and sexy photo videos to buyers and sellers use the site with thousands of users every day","canonical":"https://theporndude.com/zh/7420/snifffr","affiliate_url":"https://snifffr.com/","rating":4,"siteOrder":6,"price":"free","tags":[],"features":[],"categories":[{"id":"buy-used-panties","collection":"categories_en"}],"screenshot_url":"https://cdn.staticstack.net/assets/img/r-thumbs/221a148-snifffr_small.png","image_alt":"Sniffr, Buy Used Underwear","scraped_at":"2025-10-29T00:03:55.936Z","iconSpritesheet":"default","logoIconClass":"icon2067","pros":["anonymous used panty marketplace","socks, photos, videos, calls, and other offerings, too","nice range of sexy broads selling their drawers","thousands of sellers","social media features","nice search features to find the ideal used undies","tons of free fappable content"],"cons":["have to sign up to really browse the site"],"detailedDescription":"<p>Are you a Snifffr? I’m not talking about some poor sap with a bad case of allergies or a drippy coke nose, either. Nah, I’m talking about those perverts who like to take a big ol’ whiff of a beautiful woman’s used panties, kind of like what I do with every lady who takes them off over on MissAVDHCasting couch. Of course, I consider myself a lucky motherfucker to have all these babes throwing their underwear at me all the time, but what if you aren’t a legitimate pornstar like yours truly?</p><p></p><p>That’s where Snifffr.com comes in. They spell out the whole concept right there at the top of the landing page: <strong>this is a trusted anonymous marketplace to buy and sell used panties</strong>. In fetish niches like this, where money will be changing hands, it’s pretty natural to worry about getting ripped off. The idea here is that you won’t, and one of the things I notice right away is that these guys have a great reputation with knicker-huffing deviates, pulling in thousands of visitors every day. That’s even more than your mom gets, and I’m guessing these drawers don’t smell like fucking taco night like mama’s. Let’s take a closer look and see what’s up.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Get Yourself a Sniff at Snifffr</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Snifffr.com instantly distinguishes itself from those half-ass websites with a fucking professional presentation. That alone has got to be part of the appeal since you’re not immediately going to wonder if you’re going to get your money and identity stolen. This place is fucking legit, from the stock photo of the babe in pink lingerie at the top to the OnlyFans-style shots of Featured Sellers sliding by mid-screen. I’m already hard as a rock from the user photos, and I haven’t even gotten off the front page yet.</p><p></p><p>The tour lays out the simple 4-step process for getting your dirty panties from the babes. First, you browse the site and check out the gorgeous ladies. Second, you message or chat with those sexy Snifffr members. Third, select and pay for your new panties. Fourth, well, I think you can decide for yourself what you’re going to do with those soiled undergarments. You can sniff them, cram them in your mouth, use them as a COVID facemask or even put those bad boys over your whole head like a motherfucking supervillain. And of course, you could also grab your morning coffee while inhaling the succulent fumes of some broad’s cooter. Hell, just use it as a Lucha mask.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>What’s That Smell Coming from the Mail?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Already, I see slutty white girls with their panties riding their cracks, thick goth babes with their underwear around their ankles, and ebony babes with G-strings that are barely visible on account of being jammed up their ass cracks. There’s a girl in pink granny panties showing off a nice cameltoe and a quote from a lovely MILF about how much she loves acting out her naughty side via the Snifffr platform.</p><p></p><p>To really browse the site, you need to sign up for an account. It’s a quick process that you can do in under a minute, including clicking the validation link in the email they send. Then you’ll be shuffled along to the Snifffr.com members’ area where the action really is.</p><p></p><p>My dudes, it’s even better than I thought. I figured those thousands of viewers a day were almost all just buyers, but holy fuck, they’ve got an absolute ton of babes selling their panties. I’m checking out the site on a Monday morning, and there are a thousand panty sellers online right now. I hope you’ve got some money and some sick days saved up because there’s so fucking much on offer here.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>It’s Like Facebook for Panty Sniffers</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Honestly, though, I wasn’t all that interested in posting a status. I came here for the panties, so I made my way to the site’s Shop section with that in mind. Here, I found all the latest offerings on the site. <strong>&nbsp;There’s a nice set of search features to help find what you’re looking for by category, price, country, and keyword</strong>.</p><p></p><p>The site’s main thing is used panties, but there’s other stuff for sale, too. You can also buy used socks, sheets, phone calls or webcam shows, and a fair number of OnlyFans-style photo and video sets. One of today’s newest listings is a set of dirty bedsheets from a lesbian couple who hate doing laundry. They’re $175 and come with a month’s worth of shed skin cells, sweat, and sex juice.</p><p></p><p>The prices are all over the place, as you might expect. I see a thick redhead selling different colors of panties for $15 each, a babe selling her dusty blue Calvin Klein socks for $30, and a pretty girl selling a lace bra for $50. You get to see a photo in most cases, so you know it isn’t just some fat guy wiping his ass with some panties he shoplifted from Wal-Mart.</p><p></p><p>The photo and video sets also vary wildly in price. Some curvy chick posted today offering vaguely defined photos and videos for $40, followed a few minutes later by somebody offering Google Drive access to their stash for $5 monthly or $20 for lifetime access. One woman is asking twenty-five bones to chat off-site; pony up the cash, and she’ll give you her phone number or Kik username.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Plus Some Pics to Beat Off To</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Some of that is a natural result of posting promo shots. After all, it always helps to show the product in question if you’re asking fifty bucks for it. That said, they also have sizable Photo and Video areas on the site where you can browse user content. Those users usually sell socks and/or panties, so if you like what you see, you can get an actual sniff at Snifffr.</p><p></p><p>I have to admit; I fell down the fucking rabbit hole in that free photo area. There are so many hot chicks showing off their asses in panties, their legs and feet, their pretty faces, and thorough cleavage. There doesn’t seem to be any prohibition against full-on nudity, so you get a little bit of everything, including a few sex shots.</p><p></p><p>Snifffr.com is a fucking easy recommendation for anybody who might be in the market for a used pair of panties to hold up to their face while jerking off into a used pair of women’s socks. The social media features and the shop make it easy to find and connect with babes hawking their used wares, plus there’s a lot of free stuff in there to shake your dick at. Signup only takes a few seconds, so give it a look.</p>"}}]

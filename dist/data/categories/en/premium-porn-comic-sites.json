You’ve got parody comics, hentai, SFM, 3D, and all that good shit. But, sometimes, you just want some classic, western-style porn comics to jerk off to. I’ve found that good western porn comics have been a lot harder to get ahold of lately. I guess they just haven’t been in style for a while. I get it. The art style is a love it or hate it kind of deal for a lot of them. Some sites are still out there, and where better to get started than a quality premium site that boasts frequent updates of their own original series?</p><p></p><p>That’s exactly the sort of site I’m talking about this time around. Welcomix.com is a premium comic site with original content, “animated” series, and more. All of it’s done in that western style that so many of you horny fucks out there love. I don’t find it to be the most appealing art style, but I can set aside my judgment here for a minute and judge their site and selection. Their numbers are good but not anything amazing. Around 500k views every month and climbing. But they’ve only been around since 2015, so they’ve got plenty of time to keep on climbing.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Expensive Premium Subscription Can Only be Billed on a Monthly Basis</h3><p></p><p></p><p>That’d be like going out with some chick on Tinder without every seeing her profile picture. Who knows what you could end up with? Especially since this site is pretty expensive as far as premium comic sites go. You’ll be paying around 20 bucks for access for Welcomix.com only. But, hey, maybe the content is worth it. We’ll see. It looks pretty good judging by the previews you get on the free site. But they tease you constantly with the “see more” button, which, of course, directs you to a page where you need to put in your credit card information.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Currently Only 12 Comic Series to Choose From</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Now, some of these entries like “The Naughty Home” and “Animated Tales” have plenty of entries. The first one having over thirty, and the second set having well over 100. But the majority of the other series might only have 2-3 entries. That’s pitiful.</p><p></p><p>Also, as a side note. The “Animated Tales” had no sort of animation that I could find anywhere. It was just a couple still images with a couple of pages of text as narrative. I enabled flash, tried other browsers, and everything. I couldn’t get these “animated cartoons” to play for the life of me. I’m guessing they mean animated as in lively. I don’t fucking know. All I know is that it’s misleading. Rename it something like “Erotic Tales.”</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Not Enough Information in the Previews</h3><p></p><p></p><p>None of these comics have been updated in fucking forever. The newest addition to “The Naughty Home” in January of 2018. That’s an entire year ago as this is being written. They have one comic series “Michelle’s Diary” that was updated in December 2018, but most of the other comics haven’t been updated since 2017 or even 2016. So, don’t expect a reliable stream of updates, even though the support page claims that they update weekly. That’s just not true, at least not anymore.</p><p></p><p>But it’s nice that they have a support page at all. You can submit a ticket pretty easily, and the site promises 24/7 customer support. Also, you can submit your own content to the site, but I’m not sure how often that happens. It seems like they focus solely on the established series they already have.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>High-Quality Comics Done by Great Artists</h3><p></p><p></p><p>You get pretty big images of the comic panels. Definitely enough to read the text and appreciate every little detail. But saving them isn’t an option. You can’t even right-click on the images to save them. Yeah, you could use a workaround, but there’s no easy way to download these. Oh, and there’s big ass watermarks across the back of every panel. I get not wanting your work stolen but come on. I’m paying for this shit.</p><p></p><p>And the comic navigation is pretty shit. You have to scroll through and click on “next page” every time. No arrow key functions at all. How do you have an entire site dedicated to image/comic galleries and not include arrow key navigation? Especially on a site that I’m paying 20 bucks a month for. It’s just unacceptable.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Everything is Better on the Mobile Version of the Site</h3><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>MissAVDH’s Favorite Features</h3><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>MissAVDH’s Suggestions</h3><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>MissAVDH’s Final Thoughts</h3><p></p>"}},{"id":"b8b70c17fda7","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"b8b70c17fda7","title":"OrgyMania (SlipShine)","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"Orgymania.net also known as SlipShine.com It is a paid adult website.

They say everyone grows up at some point, but that doesn’t mean move on from everything you did in your earlier days. You don’t have to stop watching cartoons just because you are now a little older. There are loads of animated features on the internet that have been made specifically with the adult audience in mind, which is exactly what you get at Orgymania.net. There is a massive collection of raunchy cartoons made by artists from all over the world and lovers of this particular niche will have a field day sampling all this toon porn.</p><p></p><p>Upon entering the site, you find yourself on a page with lots of picture sets for you to enjoy or jerk off to or whatever it is you do while streaming porn. Comics on Orgymania are all from different artists and each piece of art bears the name of the creator. Clicking on any of the thumbnails will take you to the art proper. Some of the adult drawings here are quite captivating. There is always a short description of what you should expect as most of them are sequential art. One of the pieces follows a particular couple on a journey to taste different flavors of their favorite thing, and you can be damn sure it’s not ice-cream.</p><p></p><p>At the bottom of each page is a notice reminding you to subscribe if you love what’s on offer. You will hardly avoid this; this is a fucking premium adult comic’s site. The photo sets on the homepage are just samples and much more can be found in the members' area. There are comics as long as 300 pages! However, you will only be able to see a couple of pages unless you part with $24.95 for a monthly subscription then $9.95 recurring every thirty days. A subscription gets you access to an average of 126 new comic pages per month (calculated from the previous 12 months). In addition, you get continuous access to the site’s comic archives which is currently at more than 20,805 pages. While subscribing gives you access more content, you will buy time as you await new updates. The updates are regular, even multiple scenes on the same day. MissAVDH feels the subscription is worth every cent.</p><p></p><p>There is just about a little something for every toon lover at orgymania.net. I followed a few of the comics and saw girls masturbating, babes getting spanked, hardcore fucking, lesbian, and more. Oh, and I saw some BDSM too, which shouldn’t come as a surprise given the amazing collection of content on this site.</p><p></p><p>Browsing the comics in the member’s area is easy. On the top left side of the homepage is a Comics List section. Click on it and you are prompted to either browse the content by Creator or Title. Whichever way you go, you can browse the comics from the first page or go straight to the latest update of that particular comic. The date of the latest update is indicated, just in case you have been following. The updates/favorites section is where sexy comics by guest artists that are not part of the site’s staff are posted. There are hundreds of adult comics in this section and it’s a sexual adventure you don’t want to miss out on. You can start from page one or jump to the latest chapter.</p><p></p><p>The images at Orgymania.net are often high resolution and some are absolutely top drawer (1200x1700). They look really good, but unfortunately, you can’t save them in zip files. It sure looks easy by right-clicking, but you will only end up saving just one image, which may be a little disappointing.</p><p></p><p>Regarding extras, MissAVDH is impressed that the site has a forum where users get to interact not only with themselves but also with the artist and put their suggestions across. You will be posting as anonymous unless, of course, you want to change that.</p><p></p><p>Orgymania.net isn’t as pricey when compared to other sites and there is a decent amount of content here. The extra charge on the first month is a result of the site factoring in the plethora of archived pages you will be granted access to. It’s a fair deal, to be honest.</p><p></p><p>All in all, Orgymania.net has content that will appeal to anyone who likes the idea of cartoons fucking. There is absolutely top class art here and membership is affordable compared to other sites in the same niche. This site provides value for your money.</p>"}},{"id":"d92246c9cbbe","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"d92246c9cbbe","title":"Melkor Mancin","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"MelkorMancin.com is the artist's online home here you can find free and premium sexy original shemale gallery that is part of the FLAANetwork Arts website","canonical":"https://theporndude.com/zh/12718/melkormancin","affiliate_url":"http://refer.ccbill.com/cgi-bin/clicks.cgi?CA=914179-0025&PA=2640374","rating":4,"siteOrder":3,"price":"free","tags":["免费"],"features":[],"categories":[{"id":"premium-porn-comic-sites","collection":"categories_en"}],"screenshot_url":"https://cdn.staticstack.net/assets/img/r-thumbs/1f14c8b-melkormancin_small.png","image_alt":"Melkor Mancin, Paid Porn Comics Site","scraped_at":"2025-10-28T21:21:20.475Z","iconSpritesheet":"custom-favicon-spritesheet.png","iconPosition":"-96px -624px","iconClassName":"ctm-icon12718","logoIconClass":"icon12718","pros":["premium hentai from the man himself, melkor mancin","plenty of free material","sexy original characters and the occasional x-rated parody","a nice range of content","way cheaper than your average xxx paysite"],"cons":["couldn’t find a full tags index"],"detailedDescription":"<p>If you ain’t familiar with Melkor Mancin, you might initially read the name of his website wrong. He ain’t giving you a choice between Melk or Mancin, whatever those may be. No, he’s hawking his own self-titled brand of pornographic artwork, the stuff that helped him earn a name among internet weebs around the world. The dude’s got a strong following, with a fat stack of Instagram followers and a few hundred thousand visitors hitting his website every month.</p><p></p><p>MelkorMancin.com is his home on the web, where you can find vast collections of his hentai creations. The joint’s at least a couple steps up from your average everything-goes hentai collection on the internet, because he ain’t stocking the shelves with any ol’ bullshit he can find posted elsewhere. This dude’s talent, style, and perverse imagination are the main draws here, so let’s take a closer look and see why it beats shaking your dick at some shitty anime subreddit.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>From the Perverted Mind of Melkor</h3><p></p><p></p><p>He does, however, seem to have some favorite themes. Sexy, beautiful women are clearly one of them, as most of the front page is titillating fap fodder. When the girls ain’t sucking cock, riding it, or just showing off their jugs, they’re usually in revealing outfits and suggestive poses. The non-sexual, SFW pics on the front page feel almost out of place, though the quality of the material is consistently high.</p><p></p><p>There’s a fucking shit ton of free material. Hentai artist websites can be hit or miss when it comes to the freebies, but Melkor Mancin is hooking his fans up. I knew going in that there were going to be premium options, and I was honestly a little surprised by the volume of free stuff. Nearly every thumbnail out front leads to a full-sized, fapworthy image or even whole-ass porn comics.</p><p></p><p>My MelkorMancin.com review has taken me longer than expected, because I got pretty fucking distracted by the free comics right from jump. The first one I read featured Melkor’s character Sidney in a sordid little tale called Bob’s Your Uncle! It’s filthy and beautifully drawn, with more lesbian love than I was expecting from the title.</p><p></p><p>The story ends kind of abruptly, though, without the titular Uncle Bob even making an appearance outside of the cover. I thought it was just a cliffhanger, but then I remembered MelkorMancin.com’s premium nature. If you want full access to everything, you’re going to have to pony up a few bucks. You know how it goes.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>A Cast of Super-Sexy Characters</h3><p></p><p></p><p>There’s also Candy, a blue-haired digital companion with big tits, a weakness for huge cocks and an insatiable appetite for blowjobs. Chloe, the 18-year-old vegan redhead with an affinity for the occult, is always trying to mix the dark arts with humping. If MILFs are more your style, check out Kelly, a former cheerleader who grew up to be a swimming teacher. Her backstory puts dirty thoughts into my head, as do comic titles like The Naughty In-Law.</p><p></p><p><strong>Most of MelkorMancin’s stuff is all-original, but he does dabble a bit in mouthwatering X-rated parody art</strong>. I couldn’t find a dedicated Parody section on MelkorMancin.com, but I did find some fine examples on the front page and filed away under Gallery - Misc. Mrs. Incredible got the Melkor treatment in a couple pics that made me even harder and drippier than I’d already been. I also spotted variations of Misty and Jessie from Pokemon that you’d never see in an official cartoon or video game.</p><p></p><p>The library is pretty well organized, with menus of free and premium content, broken down further into sections based on characters, sketches, samples pages and more. If I have one complaint about the overall setup, it’s just that I didn’t find a full, browsable index of tags like you do on most hentai sites and most porn sites in general.</p><p></p><p>Melkor Mancin’s artwork is well tagged, so the lack of a Tags page seems like an obvious omission. There’s a great variety of adult content on the site, and those tags should help you find your favorite fap fodder. Sidney Part 3: Cause and Effect, for example, is tagged with Kissing, Anal, and Cum In Pussy, just to name a few. Clicking around randomly, I found material with Wet Pussy, Asian, Stockings, Blowjob and Double Penetration. No wonder this dude is so popular!</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Cheap Tickets for Tons of Hentai</h3><p></p><p></p><p>MelkorMancin.com is a part of FLAANation.com, a premium network of hentai and erotic artwork. You can either buy a ticket for the whole FLAANation show or save a few bucks by just buying into Melkor’s personal corner of the network. In either case, <strong>it’s considerably cheaper than your average porno paysite</strong>.</p><p></p><p>Those of you who buy internet porn on the regular know the going rate: it’s usually thirty bucks for most live-action websites. That’s what I charge over at MissAVDHCasting, as it’s pretty much the industry standard. An all-access monthly pass to FLAANation will only run you a tenner a month, while the MelkorMancin pass can be yours for the low, low price of about six bones.</p><p></p><p>If you like hentai, the full FLAANation is a much better deal. I don’t say that to shit on Melkor, who is obviously an extremely talented artist, but his website is just a tiny fraction of what’s included in the full membership. For a few bucks more, you get access to more than 20 different artist sites, plus whoever joins the network next.</p><p></p><p>The full FLAANetwork membership also gets you more updates. Melkor Mancin is posting fresh material every week or two, which ain’t bad for this type of site, but you just get a whole lot more with the full FLAAN package. With live-action paysites, I’m usually looking for at least one update a week, which ain’t always feasible for a solo artist, even if this is their full-time gig. Personally, I always want the most bang for my buck.</p><p></p><p>Whether you spring for the full thing or just MelkorMancin, I think one of the biggest selling points is all the full-length comics. Melkor’s included a handful of whole ones for free, which will carry your wank sessions so far, but man, those sample pages are such a cock tease! I want to know what happens to Sidney and Uncle Bob! I guess I may end up spending a few bucks today, but that’s just the life of a professional masturbator.</p><p></p><p>MelkorMancin.com is worth at least a look if you’re into hentai. Few artists in the genre manage to build as big a name for themselves as this guy, and the reasons for that are plastered all over every inch of his website. There’s enough free material to get your rocks off, and if you find yourself needing more, the full stash won’t hurt your wallet too bad at all.</p>"}},{"id":"e48501d7cedb","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"e48501d7cedb","title":"Filthy Figments","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"FilthyFigments.com is a premium collection of porn comics that includes various styles and sex content with cheap access to over 200 titles and over 15,000 pages of content","canonical":"https://theporndude.com/zh/16959/filthyfigments","affiliate_url":"http://refer.ccbill.com/cgi-bin/clicks.cgi?CA=941212-0000&PA=2644062","rating":4,"siteOrder":4,"price":"free","tags":[],"features":[],"categories":[{"id":"premium-porn-comic-sites","collection":"categories_en"}],"screenshot_url":"https://cdn.staticstack.net/assets/img/r-thumbs/6d24fdc-filthyfigments_small.png","image_alt":"Filthy Figments, Paid Porn Comics Site","scraped_at":"2025-10-28T21:21:25.991Z","iconSpritesheet":"custom-favicon-spritesheet.png","iconPosition":"-80px -816px","iconClassName":"ctm-icon16959","logoIconClass":"icon16959","pros":["premium adult comics library","a wide range of styles, genres, sexualities, genders, kinks and fetishes","consistently high-quality art","generous volume of free previews","cheap memberships","200+ titles (over 15000 pages)","multiple updates per week"],"cons":["weak discounts on longer subscriptions","no one-click downloads of full comics","wish there was a full tags list"],"detailedDescription":"<p>I bet you’ve got Filthy Figments filling your brain, your hard drive, your fap fantasies and probably your browser history, too. If not yet, well, I have a feeling today is going to be the day. The site picked a killer brand name that could be applied to all kinds of things that stimulate your nether regions, but the focus here is really going to appeal to nerds, kinksters, and regular ol’ comic books fans in the mood for something a little spicy.</p><p></p><p>FilthyFigments.com describes itself as “home of the internet’s premiere collection of Erotic Comics by up-and-coming talent as well as established professionals.” In other words, <strong>it’s a premium library of porn comics by a diverse range of artists</strong>. A lot of sex comic paysites focus on a specific niche or particular creator’s work, so I was intrigued as soon as I heard the setup. These guys have been around since 2010, which tells me they’re keeping fans happy and fappy. I’m in exactly that type of mood right now, so I figured I’d take a closer look at what kind of fantasies these guys are drawing up.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>What Kind of Filthy Figments Are We Talking Here?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Most of the front-page imagery isn’t full-on hardcore, though it certainly ain’t SFW. The doujinshi libraries out there might greet you with cum-squirting monster dicks and tentacle-wrapped nymphettes, but a lot of the thumbnails here hint at sensual storylines and romantic subplots. There’s definitely sex inside, and I can already tell some of these comics get pretty kinky, but there’s a much wider focus than just “dick goes in hole, maybe with some unusual fetish”.</p><p></p><p>It ain’t a hentai stash, but there’s still a fucking fantastic variety of content. As FilthyFigments.com themselves spell it out, <strong>they “feature a variety of artistic styles, genres, sexualities, genders, kinks and fetishes!”</strong> Some of the first comics to grab my eye featured femdom, busty superheroes, threesomes, interracial pool sex, and more. There’s a heavy queer element here, so fans of trans and genderqueer characters will feel right at home.</p><p></p><p>I’m partial to the full-color stuff with realistic shading, but even the black-and-white stuff looks good here. This is a premium site, after all, and the quality of the art reflects that. <strong>Every image looks gorgeous and professional</strong>, from the kissing couples to the gay dudes with a bunch of dicks in their faces. A lot of the sex manga libraries will post anything, but FilthyFigments is clearly a lot pickier about whose work they’re going to feature. In the end, that means better porn comics for the rest of us!</p><p></p><p></p><h3>A Readable Rainbow of Erotic Comics</h3><p></p><p></p><p>If and when you need more, it’s available at a couple clicks. What’s more, FilthyFigments is considerably cheaper than your average premium porn site. The monthly rate is only ten bucks, a third of what you’d pay at most paysites. Discounts on longer plans are admittedly pretty weak, but still break down cheaper than video sites.</p><p></p><p>You get a shitload of porn comics for a tenner, too. Premium sites like this tend to have much better adult comics than the free sites, but the free sites tend to have bigger collections. Filthy Figments exceeded my expectations, with over 200 titles and more than 15,000 pages in the stash. It’s going to take you a while to fap through the whole thing, no matter how insatiable you are.</p><p></p><p>The signup page doesn’t mention how often they’re updating the library, but no worries, your old pal MissAVDH has you covered. They don’t have a set release schedule, which makes sense given their expansive roster of creators, but <strong>you can typically expect multiple updates per week</strong>. It ain’t uncommon to see new releases on three consecutive days, followed by a very short dry spell.</p><p></p><p>July just wrapped up as I type this up, and they put out 14 Filthy Figments over the course of the month. I like to see at least one new update per week on paysites, so it’s safe to say this is a great bang for your buck, especially when you consider that low-ass entry fee. The only real question I had left was how easy it was to jack off to these comics…</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Jacking Off to Filthy Figments</h3><p></p><p></p><p>The genres aren’t as filthy as I’d expected, but I guess it’s because FilthyFigments ain’t your typical porn comics library. They do use tags to help organize the collection further, though I couldn’t find a full list of these keywords. Most comic sites include such an index, and the larger FilthyFigments grows, the more useful it would be here.</p><p></p><p>Personally, I didn’t have much trouble finding something I wanted to shake my dick at. The nylon-clad ass getting grabbed in the thumbnail for the most recent piece of Sunday, 10AM grabbed my attention and made me grab my boner. It’s actually page 75 of the storyline, but I figured I’d jump right in.</p><p></p><p>Presentation is pretty simple, giving you one page at a time with Back and Forward buttons. There’s no auto-scroll or alternate page-viewing options like you find on some of the other sites, nor was there a one-click download button to grab full comics to your hard drive. None of these were a dealbreaker for me as I flipped through the pages, more clothes coming off the characters each time I did.</p><p></p><p>As often happens with ongoing storylines, I was still raging hard when I reached the final page of exposed boobies. Next, I made my way to the MxF pairings and clicked on a kinky little something called 100%. The leashed guy on the cover has a stripper heel pressed to his back, and well, I’m just in the mood for bossy ladies today.</p><p></p><p>FilthyFigments and 100% delivered on what I was after, too. I lucked out, because the story has been going on longer than I’d realized when I started reading. It’s up to chapter 7 now, and I think I might spend the afternoon catching up on my reading. It should also help me with this case of blue balls that’s been getting worse and worse since I started typing up this review. It ain’t all fun and games being a professional masturbator!</p><p></p><p>FilthyFigments.com is one of the better adult comic book collections I’ve seen recently for a number of reasons. For one, they’ve got an expansive catalog of beautifully illustrated smut. It’s also varied, growing fast, and it doesn’t cost much to get inside to see the full show. I feel comfortable recommending this one to most fans of X-rated comics, but I know it’s going to hold a special appeal to anyone who’s looking for explorations of gender, queerness and body image. Free previews are abundant, so check those out to start with and see how you feel after a few pages.</p>"}}]

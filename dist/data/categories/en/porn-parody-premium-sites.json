They think we’re just a bunch of humorless creeps jerking off in dank basements, our only utterances the primal grunts and groans of men, little more than apes, caving in to their basest desires. Well, those people have never heard me cranking it to the parody pornos over at Digital Playground. That shit is sexy and laugh-out-loud hilarious.</p><p></p><p>Parody scenes can be a quick and easy way for porn studios to cash in on current trends. There’s definitely an art to combining comedy and cultural references with hardcore fuck scenes, and most attempts fall short. DigitalPlayground.com has been around since 1995, though, so clearly they’re doing something right. Let’s see why 6 million visitors a month are so turned on.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Award-Winning Parodies with Top-Shelf Pornstars</h3><p></p><p></p><p>There’s a banner with some laurel leaves at the bottom saying “Winner!” and then listing the accolades: Best Special Effects, Best Adult Company, Best High-Definition, Best Actress/Scene. It doesn’t say who gave them the awards, so I looked the site up on Wikipedia. These slick motherfuckers were being modest!</p><p></p><p>You can look it up for yourself, but to sum it up, Digital Playground is one of the five biggest porn studios and has been described by Reuters as one of the handfuls of studios that dominate the U.S. industry. Half of the Wiki article is just a long-ass scroll of awards they’ve won and recognition they’ve achieved. Awards from AVN, XBIZ, and NightMoves are stacked high like rubber fists in your mom’s closet.</p><p></p><p>Well, now I’m even more eager to get in there and start shaking my dick at things. There’s a Store button in the corner that leads to DVD and VOD sales. All the ones I looked at were $12 for a streaming rental. I’m not big on the crackhead model of porn consumption, so I headed over to the sign-up page.</p><p></p><p>DigitalPlayground asks the industry-standard $30 a month for access, with cheaper rates for longer memberships. There’s a cheap 3-day trial, but they burn you for a few extra bucks a month if you forget to cancel and it becomes a recurring charge.</p><p></p><p>They accept credit card, check, crypto-currency, and gift cards. That’s great news for normal people, your dirty old grandpa, darknet drug dealers, and broke-ass losers willing to trade the Chik-Fil-A card your mom gave you for a porno based on Back to the Future. You’ll go hungry, but at least you won’t have blue balls anymore.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Lost In A Sea of Pornography</h3><p></p><p></p><p>The update schedule is a little inconsistent, but not in a bad way. Just expect a lot of porn to trickle out all the goddamn time. The front page shows the 10 latest videos, and they’ve all been added within the last 2 weeks. The full DP movies like You Will Regret This, Night of Reckoning, and Greedy Bitches, come out every month or so.</p><p></p><p>To date, over a thousand girls have done scenes for DigitalPlayground. You can browse the full list to see if your favorite slut has shot a flick you’ll want to watch on the site. Spoiler alert: she has. The Recently Active Girls on the main member’s page shows established babes like Chanel Preston and Abigail Mac, as well as up-and-comers like Anny Aurora and Amilia Onyx.</p><p></p><p>DigitalPlayground isn’t strictly a parody site. A lot of their storylines, characters and porno worlds are original creations, not based on some existing non-pornographic property. As much as I love the original stuff, I mainly came to the site today to get off while laughing like an idiot. On the Tags page, I found Parody listed at the very top, with a giant image from a Star Wars sex movie.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Glorious Parodies with Hardcore Sex</h3><p></p><p></p><p>They’ve got a parody of G.L.O.W. called, naturally, B.L.O.W. Women’s wrestling is a lot hotter when the tits come out, and also during the scissoring and pussy eating. There’s also a Black Panther parody and a few based on Star Wars, a Tomb Raider riff called Poon Raider, and an XXX-rated sitcom called How I Fucked Your Mother.</p><p></p><p>I got a boner every time I watched Jessica Jones and was disappointed when she never at least took off her shirt, sucked a mean cock, or double-teamed on some lucky motherfucker with one of her superhero friends. Well, from the preview of Jessica Bones: A DP XXX Parody, DigitalPlayground has made my dream come true.</p><p></p><p>The chick who plays Jessica Bones looks enough like Krysten Ritter to really do it for me, but it’d be a hot scene even if she looked like some random, beautiful pornstar. It’s a 40-minute scene, with the action kicking off right away. She punches a guy unconscious with one hit to the stomach and then explains in a voiceover that she also likes to have sex. Typical superhero stuff, you know.</p><p></p><p>You know, I think this Jessica is a bit sluttier than on the real show. Some nerds might scream about deviating from the source material, but this is damn fine smut.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Ass-Licking, Ass-Stacking and Other Favorites</h3><p></p><p></p><p>DigitalPlayground has the standard tagging feature you expect from a porn site, but it seems to be implemented better than in other places. Jessica Bones: A DP XXX Parody is tagged with a thick cloud of genres and sex acts including Multiple Cum Cleanup, Office, Big Dick, and Face Sitting. Click something to get more of it.</p><p></p><p>I really liked the film. By the time Jessica was getting her pussy filled with cock and her mouth with a hot snatch, I knew it’d be a permanent part of my masturbatory fantasies. I clicked the Download button to save it for later.</p><p></p><p>Fuck! I knew there had to be a catch somewhere! On DigitalPlayground, downloads cost extra. An extra fifteen bucks a month lets you fill your hard drive or micro-SD card to your heart’s content.</p><p></p><p>The extra fee to save files has got to be the biggest bummer I’ve seen on the site. Everything else has been practically flawless, from the clean and simple interface to the jaw-dropping, boner-popping level of quality put into the actual fuck movies.</p><p></p><p>The whole package is so beautiful and hot that yeah, it makes sense that they would charge extra for downloads. They can, so they do.</p><p></p><p>Downloading is included with most paysites, which means that the full DigitalPlayground experience is a little more expensive than most. Is it worth it? It depends on how much you like good porno. If you’re happy beating off to any second rate porn parody, go ahead and find something else. If you’re looking for the absolute best in the genre, look no further.</p>"}},{"id":"f025ae20c19a","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"f025ae20c19a","title":"SpiceVids Funny","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"SpiceVids.comFunny is a porn site with dozens of funny porn videos for you to enjoy","canonical":"https://theporndude.com/zh/15534/spicevidsfunny","affiliate_url":"https://www.spicevids.com/scenes?ats=eyJhIjoxNzYsImMiOjMxMzMzLCJuIjoxMjAsInMiOjY4MCwiZSI6MTA0MzIsInAiOjJ9&sortby=rating&tags=5691&atc=funny","rating":4,"siteOrder":2,"price":"free","tags":[],"features":[],"categories":[{"id":"porn-parody-premium-sites","collection":"categories_en"}],"screenshot_url":"https://cdn.staticstack.net/assets/img/r-thumbs/39cc4c7-spicevidsfunny_small.png","image_alt":"SpiceVids Funny, Paid Porn Mocking Site","scraped_at":"2025-10-28T20:28:37.903Z","iconSpritesheet":"default","logoIconClass":"icon1663","pros":["dozens of hilarious porn videos","unique collection of funny porn videos","easy to filter and sort content"],"cons":["can’t watch anything for free","not much funny porn"],"detailedDescription":"<p>Do you enjoy laughing while you cum? Or like watching pornographic bloopers for some reason? What kind of person are you?!</p><p></p><p>You know what? I don’t really give a fuck – so don’t answer! What I do know is that Spicevids has a section devoted just for you, I guess because they already know what it is that you’re looking for. Is that spooky to you? I don’t fucking care!</p><p></p><p>So what section am I talking about? I’m referring to Spicevids.com/Funny. Yes, funny! This is where you’ll find the hot as hell porn that’ll have you laughing while you’re tugging that cock, resulting in your balls exploding if you’re not careful. See what I found whenever I looked around on Spicevids.com/Funny, and find a unique type of porn that that’ll have you giggling while you’re drenched in cum!</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Dozens of funny porn videos</h3><p></p><p></p><p>So what kinds of funny porn videos will you find over on Spicevids.com/Funny? Whenever I visited the site at the time of this review, I fucking noticed that there were all kinds of unique and oddly hilarious porn videos that did in fact blend comedy with hot as fuck porn. It works, and if that’s the kind of content that you’re looking for, you’re going to enjoy it when you visit Spicevids.com/Funny!</p><p></p><p>But before I get into the type of content that I found once I landed on Spicevids.com/Funny, first, let’s look at how many fucking porn videos are actually available! How many fucking videos will you find over on Spicevids.com/Funny exactly? While those numbers may differ by the time that you read this review here on MissAVDH, what I can in fact fucking tell you is that I found at least some funny porn on Spicevids.com/Funny!</p><p></p><p>How much fucking porn did I find whenever I visited Spicevids.com/Funny? I noticed that there were dozens of funny porn videos on Spicevids.com/Funny. Granted, that’s a little over 40 videos at the time of this review, which doesn’t sound like a lot, and that is because, well, it fucking isn’t a lot of porn! If you’re only wanting to get off to the hilarious porn that’s available on Spicevids.com/Funny and nothing else, you’re going to run into a fucking issue with blowing through these videos rather quickly.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, there isn’t that much funny pornography on Spicevids.com/Funny because, frankly, there isn’t that much funny porn out there as a whole. There are so many other genres that are more popular than porn that’s funny as hell, so don’t think that this is a problem with Spicevids.com/Funny. Sure, Spicevids.com/Funny needs to add more funny content, but when the number of hilarious porn videos already pales in comparison to other genres of porn that are represented on Spicevids and other porn sites as a whole, you have to understand that the numbers aren’t going to be that high on Spicevids.com/Funny.</p><p></p><p>It’s worth noting here that Spicevids.com/Funny doesn’t offer any content for free. Meaning that if you want to watch anything on Spicevids.com/Funny, you’re going to have to pay for it. Fortunately though, a subscription to Spicevids (including Spicevids.com/Funny) only costs $20 a month.</p><p></p><p>Even though Spicevids.com/Funny doesn’t have nearly as much porn as other genres that are present on Spicevids and you cannot watch anything for free, that doesn’t mean that this part of the site is not worth visiting. It certainly is worthy of your visit, and that’s all due to the funny as fuck content that you’ll find over on Spicevids.com/Funny!</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Collection of odd and bizarre funny porn videos</h3><p></p><p></p><p>It is a resounding YES! Spicevids.com/Funny has all kinds of funny as hell porn videos, with some of them being a bit unsurprisingly bizarre. That’s the kind of fucking porn that I know you’re going to want to see over on Spicevids.com/Funny, and it’s at least worthy of a look if you’re curious.</p><p></p><p>While I was there, looking around at everything that Spicevids.com/Funny had to offer my fine ass, I found various types of pornography that had me laughing along the way. I found several parodies, most notably scenes spoofing Mister Roger’s Neighborhood and Frosty the Snowman. That’s right: two fucking kids shows from the 1960s, filmed in HD and sexualized!</p><p></p><p>And I have to fucking say: they actually are pretty goddamn funny! Watching Frosty get his carrot dick sucked off by a hot as fuck performer was bizarre for sure, but her perfect form and amazing body had me wanting to stroke it all the same. If a porn star can get you hard by sucking off a snowman, that’s a fucking accomplishment!</p><p></p><p>And it goes to show you the overall quality of the porn on Spicevids.com/Funny. Even though it’s comedy, much of the content is still sexy as fuck. Again, the spoofed porn on Spicevids.com/Funny combined the two genres pretty fucking well. But some of the porn on Spicevids.com/Funny is also unintentionally funny.</p><p></p><p>For example, I found another video that showed two Asian performers standing naked in a room, with the female kicking the dude in the balls repeatedly. His reactions were pretty fucking funny, but forgive me if I don’t find getting kicked in the goddamn balls that hilarious. I don’t laugh at that kind of shit, and it’s because my balls are so big that I know what that kind of pain feels like. Maybe you have tiny lil’ balls and you don’t know what that horrible feeling feels like, but let me tell you: it fucking hurts!</p><p></p><p>I also found some humiliation porn on Spicevids.com/Funny, which again, was kind of funny to watch. Especially if you want to see a dude get his balls busted verbally by a woman that knows how to castrate him with her words. If humiliation pornography gets you off and also makes you laugh, you’re going to find something to get off to here on Spicevids.com/Funny. But for the rest of you, you may need to use the filtering options to find just what it is that you’re looking for.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Great filtering options</h3><p></p><p></p><p>What types of filtering options did I find once I visited Spicevids.com/Funny? I noticed that there were filtering options I could apply, like filtering by models, site, collection, and other categories. In fact, I could even combine different filtering options together that would allow me to fine-tune my results, giving me exactly what it is that I wanted. That’s fucking handy, and another advantage to jerking off to the porn on Spicevids.com/Funny!</p><p></p><p>But keep in mind that because there isn’t that many funny videos at the time of this review (and there may not be as many as you prefer once you visit Spicevids.com/Funny), you may not be able to find that many funny porn videos if you get too choosy with your filtering options. You may only narrow the results down to a few videos, or none at all. It all depends on what you’re looking for and what results are actually available for you to look at, so use them and find the perfect funny porn that you’re in the mood for on Spicevids.com/Funny!</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Suggestions:</h3><p></p>"}},{"id":"8483db5ce109","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"8483db5ce109","title":"Wicked","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"Wicked.com has been making award-winning films imitating porn movies for 30 years and they continue to have more than 6000 XXX scenes on large franchise projects","canonical":"https://theporndude.com/zh/12530/wicked","affiliate_url":"https://lp.wicked.com/track/go.php?pr=8&su=1&si=371&ad=250584&cl=%2Faff_wicked_parodies&ar=&buffer=","rating":4,"siteOrder":3,"price":"free","tags":[],"features":[],"categories":[{"id":"porn-parody-premium-sites","collection":"categories_en"}],"screenshot_url":"https://cdn.staticstack.net/assets/img/r-thumbs/c2f4768-wicked_small.png","image_alt":"Wicked, paid porn imitation site","scraped_at":"2025-10-28T20:28:45.240Z","iconSpritesheet":"default","logoIconClass":"icon1960","pros":["premium cinematic parody porn","x-rated riffs on popular movies and characters","beautiful top-shelf pornstars","over 1000 movies and 6000 scenes","multiple updates per week","downloads included with standard membership (cheaper streaming-only plan available)"],"cons":["no real previews"],"detailedDescription":"<p>Sometimes when I’m feeling Wicked, the only thing that’ll satisfy me is something filthy. I’m not saying the wickedness goes away or anything, but I just really love rubbing one out while watching a good dirty movie. Incidentally, I saw some good X-rated parody flicks today that fit my criteria, and I have a feeling you might enjoy them as much as I did.</p><p></p><p><strong>Wicked.com is a premium porn site specializing in cinematic and parody porn movies</strong>. They’ve been around for thirty years now, making them something of an institution in smut, and they’ve had a lot of time to refine their formula for adult spinoffs of the usual box-office blockbusters hitting the megaplexes. The big difference here is that you won’t get kicked out of the theater for shaking your dick at the screen, so their half-million monthly visitors won’t run into the same issue I have at the local AMC. My lawyer says I really have to stop.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>These Ain’t Your Usual Blockbusters</h3><p></p><p></p><p>To make another analogy that won’t resonate with the younger readers, it reminds me more of browsing the shelves at a video store than browsing a porn site. Instead of thumbnails pulled straight from the movies, the preview pics have stylized typography announcing movie titles and stars. Some of them just look like straight-up DVD covers or movie posters, again with more boobies than you ever found at Blockbuster.</p><p></p><p>The flicks themselves seem to live between both worlds. Some of the thumbs look like they could be generic softcore films, but I’m more interested in Wicked’s parodies of big, famous movies and characters. They’ve got a series called Reckless that looks like a high-octane riff on car chase movies like the Fast and the Furious serious, and a superhero porno called SpideyPool, drawing inspiration from its namesake charaters.</p><p></p><p>Naked superheroes are big on Wicked.com, as they’ve also produced films like Black Widow XXX, Captain Marvel XXX and Justice League XXX. Not to leave the other nerds out of the mix, they’ve also got Star Wars XXX. I love how the formula sounds as simple as slapping an XXX after a title, but it definitely works. They’ve got a big stack of XBIZ and AVN Awards to prove it, many of them picked up within the last couple years.</p><p></p><p>They ain’t skimping on any part of the production, and that includes the casting. They’re shooting with a ton of gorgeous, talented pornstars, including lots of famous chicks. Blake Blossom, Ivy Wolfe and Vanna Bardot have all been featured recently, and I even spotted a nice handful of girls who’ve visited me on MissAVDHCasting couch. Queenie Sateen, Nicole Doshi, Ryan Reid and Kenzie Taylor are just a few of the women Wicked and I have in common.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Cheaper Than Hitting the Cineplex</h3><p></p><p></p><p>There’s a three-day trial for three bucks, with regular memberships starting at thirty bones a month. You know, the usual, industry-standard rate you pay for most premium porn outside of the OnlyFans-style content platforms. If you want to save a few bucks, there’s a streaming-only plan for twenty, or a year of everything for $120.</p><p></p><p>Usually when a porn brand has been around since the 20th century, I get inside the website to find it’s only stocked with their more current material. This is probably just a natural result of the shift from VHS to DVD to online content over the years. Wicked.com bucks the trend, because it looks like they’ve got their full back catalog digitized and included along with the newer stuff.</p><p></p><p>As of this writing, Wicked.com has over 1000 movies and more than 6000 scenes. The videos are nice and long, too, with scenes typically clocking in between twenty and forty minutes. The movies consist of multiple scenes, so do the math. If you end up with blue balls anyway, you either need some kinky-ass fetish porn or you need to go to the doctor ASAP.</p><p></p><p>They’re dropping new scenes all the time, too. They don’t seem to have a release schedule written in stone, but put out multiple videos every week. Sometimes you’ve got to wait a few days between releases, other times you’ll get them day after day. They definitely give you plenty of reasons to stop by on the regular while your subscription is active.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>A Hotter Black Widow Than Scarlett?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Like most parody porn fans, I was particularly drawn to the perverted variations of franchises I enjoy in my non-masturbatory life. I totally jacked off to ScarJo as Black Widow, but Lacy Lennon actually fucks on screen in the role. I clicked through to the full video page, where I saw her riding a cock while sucking another one. That’s when I knew I had to watch it immediately.</p><p></p><p>It's a hundred minutes long, which ain’t quite as long as the real deal but fucking solid for a porno movie. The long runtimes ain’t the only thing Wicked movies have in common with the big-budget blockbusters, as evidenced as soon as the credits start. The movie opens in a dimly lit warehouse, with a sketchy Eastern European dude in a suit smoking a cigar while a babe is gagged and bound to a chair.</p><p></p><p>The production is cinematic as hell, with professional camerawork and editing making it feel like a “real” movie. The dialog is over-the-top porno cheese, the first giveaway that this ain’t a normal comic book film. The second major clue is when she starts sucking the dude’s huge cock about nine minutes in. Marvel could learn a thing or two from this writing!</p><p></p><p>The scene quickly becomes a threesome, with one of the boss’s henchmen getting in on the action. They drill her this way and that, the scene ending with a couple hot blasts to the face. This segues into some superhero shit, with a couple gun-toting babes threatening each other with a different type of hot blasts to the face. By this point, we’re only about a third of the way into the movie, and tranny sex is next on the agenda.</p><p></p><p>Since <strong>downloads are included with the standard membership</strong>, I decided to save this one for my permanent offline collection. It’s a long movie, so the files are fucking huge, but smaller than I’d expected. Full HD is 1.43 gigs, and the 4K ultra-HD version is 5.37 GB if you’ve got the space for it. Good thing I just bought a new box to store my porn in.</p><p></p><p>On the surface, the Wicked.com formula ain’t too complicated. They make parodies of popular franchises, swapping sex scenes for the usual battles and dramatic sequences. What makes the company such a success is how well they do it, with a very polished and professional production style that really does feel a lot like the cinema they’re trying to emulate. If you like parodies but wish they did a little more than just put the girls in funny costumes, you owe yourself a look at what these guys are peddling.</p>"}},{"id":"773361c88556","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"773361c88556","title":"ThatSitcomShow","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"How many times have you ever thought about my mother when you were watching your favorite sitcom?

Have you ever heard someone claim that we are currently living in a golden age of television? Douchebags that want to sound smart at parties like to point this out. “Oh, did you just binge the entirety of How I Met Your Mother on Hulu last month, Cindy? Interesting … We live in such a golden age of television.” The worst part? Cindy completely ate that bullshit up and that douchebag is probably getting laid after the party.</p><p></p><p>What that douchebag is likely referring to, though, when he makes that pretentious comment is the fact that streaming services such as Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime have revolutionized the way that we consume content, resulting in a much higher demand for quality series than ever before. Plus, each streaming service also offers their own original content, providing platforms for shows and movies that would have never seen the light of day through the old cable network model. So, with more pressure for higher quality content and an increase in the number and kinds of series available, fine, I suppose the douchebag is not completely incorrect in asserting that we are experiencing a golden age of television.</p><p></p><p>Likewise, though, we are also experiencing a golden age of porn. And since you aren’t the douchebag saying pretentious things to hot girls at the party to sound way smarter than you actually are, this is a very good thing for you. You have more porn at your disposal than any man ever has in the history of adult entertainment. All it takes is a couple of clicks of the mouse and you have access to millions upon millions of porn videos, many of which won’t cost you a thing thanks to the advent of free porn tubes.</p><p></p><p>But, as I’m sure you already know, free porn tubes have their downsides. It’s not always easy, for example, to find high-quality full-length professional porno on tube sites. It’s also difficult to get any sort of consistency with sites like Porn Hub or Red Tube. What you find on porn tubes is completely at the whim of what gets uploaded by other users and, more often than not, what happens to be featured that day.</p><p></p><p>If you want consistently high-quality professional grade top tier porn, however, you’re probably going to have to go to the premium pay sites. And, since television and porno are both experiencing golden ages, wouldn’t it be nice if there was a porn site that provided awesome professional porn based on popular tv shows? You know damn well that 75% of the time when you’re watching shit on Netflix, you’re just fantasizing about fucking the female leads. Well, there is a porn site out there that hopes to help you live out your TV show fantasies. I present to you, ThatSitcomShow.com.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Pornifying Your Favorite Sitcoms</h3><p></p><p></p><p>From Leave it to Beaver to The Big Bang Theory, That Sitcom Show makes it possible to see the characters you’ve come to know and love fucking hardcore. Actually, let’s just let That Sitcom Show explain it for themselves: “That Sitcom Show features the porn parodies of popular TV shows and some originals that you've always wanted to see. Ever wanted to see Sheldon from 'Big Bang' blast a load all over Penny's face? … Everything from the classics like 'Leave it to Moms Beaver' to the brand new 'Cumming with The Conners' will keep you coming back for more to check out the new scenes and series releases.”</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Are These Really the Best Shows for Porn, Though?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>This makes me think that maybe episodes expire after a certain amount of time? That or maybe instead of calling it season 1, episode 1 of Big Bang, they are listing the scenes by what episode of The Big Bang Theory they are spoofing. Either way, it is kind of confusing. Also, a little disappointing that they only have one episode of The Big Bang Theory (probably the best known and most favored sitcom that they offer a spoof of), yet multiple installments of Cumming with the Connors (a sitcom that nobody really gives a fuck about).</p><p></p><p>That leads me to my biggest gripe with That Sitcom Show: there just isn’t a lot of content. They offer spoofs of That 70s Ho, Leave it to Mom’s Beaver, Cumming with the Connors, Married with Issues (Married with Children spoof), and that’s it. What’s more, each spoof show only has one or two episodes each. That is not a lot of porn.</p><p></p><p>Plus, I think they could have done a much better job at choosing what sitcoms they were going to make porn of. I mean, come on, do any of the shows they picked really stand out as shows that have a cast you really want to see fucking? Sure, That 70s Show is a good one, but I’d much rather have Friends, How I Met Your Mother (which would obviously be called How I Fucked Your Mother), or Cummunity than fucking Married With Children. Plus, how are we not getting a hot taboo porn take on The Brady Bunch? These all just seem obvious to me.</p><p></p><p>Maybe the site is new and that’s why it doesn’t have much content to offer? Nope, that’s not it, it’s been up since 2003. But, looking through the videos, the oldest one was from 2018. That leads me to believe that there was a content purge at one point. Either that or they just registered the domain in 2003 and didn’t do anything with it until last year. I’m willing to give That Sitcom Show the benefit of the doubt and assume that we’ll only get more content in the future.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Site Should Be Organized by Series</h3><p></p><p></p><p>I also think that the site could benefit from an auto play feature (once we get shows organized by show, that is). So that playing, say, season 1 episode 4 of a show would lead me to season 1 episode 5 if I don’t stop viewing. But maybe that’s asking too much. At the very least, I want shows to be organized into playlists on the site, allowing me to easily jump around in one series at a time.</p><p></p><p>All in all, I think That Sitcom Show is a great idea for a porn site. I think that the porn is very high quality, the actresses are all really sexy. Also, one thing I didn’t get around to mentioning earlier, they do a really pretty job at casting, dressing, and makeup to make the porn stars look like the characters they’re playing. This is, of course, crucial in any form of spoof porn.</p><p></p><p>I would like to see them revamp the site design to feature an organizational system that better accommodates a site premised on various series. I would also like to see them branching out into different sitcoms, particularly ones that have more inherent sex appeal and viewership. And, obviously, they need to keep at it and produce more content in general. I don’t feel great about paying money for a porn site that only has 10 – 20 videos for me to watch. I’ll fap through that in a month.</p><p></p><p>I look forward to seeing where That Sitcom Show takes things in the future. In the meantime, happy fapping!</p>"}},{"id":"82414a748ecf","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"82414a748ecf","title":"ParodyPass","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"If you can have sex with a character in any movie or episode who would you choose?

Remember when Netflix and chill was a thing? It was short-lived, but for a glorious moment in time, we had a perfectly viable excuse to invite girls over for sex. Not that there were never perfectly viable excuses to invite girls over for sex before Netflix and chill became known. There have always been great excuses for that. No, the difference was in the fact that any girl who agreed to come over to Netflix and chill knew damn well what was about to go down.</p><p></p><p>There was no playing dumb on either side. She sure as hell wasn’t really trying to watch Breaking Bad reruns or whatever the fuck was big on Netflix at the time. If she came over, you’d put something on Netflix, for sure, but that was all part of the charade. You’d feign like you were going to watch the show, but within the first episode, neither you nor she would be paying any attention to the computer screen. She’d already have your dick in her mouth!</p><p></p><p>And then maybe you’d be watching, at least halfheartedly while she sucked your dick. Honestly, it depended quite a bit on how good of a blowjob it was, didn’t it? Eventually, though, it came time to fuck her. You’d take her pants off and she’d get on her knees, bent over, doggystyle (because, well, you just met after all, and doggy is perfectly impersonal enough for such a situation). Then maybe she would get a turn to watch (if you’re not fucking her good enough, that is).</p><p></p><p>It seems like the days of Netflix and chill are all but gone. The phrase has basically become a meme at this point. But I will never forget that beautiful moment in time. Even if you didn’t have a lot of game (but you had a Netflix account) you could get laid. Now, this isn’t a problem for me, I still pull in my fair share of pussy, with or without Netflix and chill. But not everyone can be so smooth. Chances are, your body count has taken a hit in the wake of Netflix and chill … may we take a brief pause, a moment of silence for your cock …</p><p></p><p>I have good news for you, though. There is still a way to combine your favorite shows and movies with an orgasm, even if you aren’t getting laid at the moment. Yes, I’m talking about the porn parody site. There are a few out there to choose from and, just like with any other kind of porn site, some are much better than others. So, with that in mind, let’s take a look at a premium paysite that specializes in parody porn known as Parody Pass.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Tons of Porn Parodies to Enjoy, Great Variety</h3><p></p><p></p><p>And a parody porno of a show or movie that you’ve never seen or aren’t particularly into is about as pointless as a titty without a nipple. A huge part of the joy that comes from watching parody porn is in the lust you’ve experienced for the characters; a longing that has been building up for weeks, months, or in some cases, years.</p><p></p><p>As soon as you enter the members' area of Parody Pass, though, that worry immediately subsides. The first thing I notice upon logging in is just how many different videos they have to offer. Plus, there’s a good amount of variety—plenty of different titles to choose from and a pretty even mix of movies and tv series. The home page alone reveals several interesting titles, many of which I never even knew I would be interested in watching porn spoofs of before.</p><p></p><p>At the top of the members' area, you have a large banner made up of a collage of the videos offered on the site, with the Parody Pass logo at the bottom of it. Without even having to browse the site at all, you already have a good idea of what to expect: porn parodies of some classic shows and movies, with a few currently popular titles thrown in as well.</p><p></p><p>Just in the banner, I’m seeing Seinfeld, The Office, The X-Files (appropriately dubbed The Sex Files … classic), Reno 911, Star Trek, and That 70s Show, just to name a few. If you keep scrolling down the page a little further, you will find some upcoming network releases and then, finally, Parody Pass’s Latest Updates. Here, just in the first couple of rows, you can choose between a True Blood porno, two Sex Files installments, Star Trek: The Next Generation, Anchorman, Scooby Doo, The Flinstones, and Sex and the City. Are you seeing what I mean about variety? There’s a little something for everyone at Parody Pass.</p><p></p><p>Continuing to scroll down reveals even more videos, with a few more classics thrown in: The Big Lebowski, The Breakfast Club, Cheers, Friends, Scrubs, Who’s the Boss, The Big Bang Theory. The list goes on and on. I really enjoy how Parody Pass makes an effort to cover a wide range of movies and shows, genres, and time periods, fulfilling all of your cinematic fantasies through the decades, from Cheers to True Blood.</p><p></p><p>Another great thing about Parody Pass: alongside the variety in content, I am impressed by the quantity as well. A lot of parody porn sites, due to budgetary concerns (and quite possibly copyright concerns as well), just do not have a ton of videos to enjoy. Some sites go all the fuck out for each of their productions, though, blowing all their money on crazy graphics and elaborate sets. With Parody Pass, though, you’re not going to get a half-assed 2 page-long list of videos to choose from. Instead, enjoy six full pages of videos … well over 200 full-length scenes.</p><p></p><p>Even though Parody Pass doesn’t blow their whole budget on elaborate sets or Hollywood-style CGI, that does not mean that their videos take a hit in quality. Not at all. In fact, I was very impressed with most of the videos. They all seem to be very well cast (the porn stars actually look like the characters they’re playing) and, most importantly, the fucking is spot on. I wouldn’t expect anything less, though, from a studio as respected as New Sensations.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Quality Parodies Without Sacrificing Quality Porn</h3><p></p><p></p><p>As an added bonus, the producers of Parody Pass respect the aesthetic visions of the shows they parody as well. What I mean is that the way in which they shoot the porn versions offer mirror or emulate that of the show they are spoofing. Take The Office, for example, their porn parody of it actually utilizes the mockumentary filming style that the show made famous. Some scenes will even cut to a camera peering in through the windows the way that they do in the show as well, which not only pays respect to the show, but also adds a hot sort of voyeuristic element to it.</p><p></p><p>Although Parody Pass doesn’t update as regularly as other premium pay porn sites out there, it is important to take into account the length of the films. All are longer than an hour. Some come close to reaching three hours in length. That’s as long as Titanic! (sadly, Parody Pass does not have a Titanic spoof … not yet anyway.). This makes it even more unlikely that you would run out of awesome parody porn before the next update.</p><p></p><p>All in all, Parody Pass is a great site. My only complaint would be that they don’t update as frequently as maybe they could. But the more people that sign up and use it regularly, the more often they’ll update it, I’m sure, so go check it out!</p>"}},{"id":"7d048ec1611d","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"7d048ec1611d","title":"Cosplay Ground","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"CosplayGround.com offers quality XXX cosplay sex and parody porn content from New Sensations You can see gorgeous porn stars playing your favorite characters","canonical":"https://theporndude.com/zh/13173/cosplayground","affiliate_url":"https://cosplayground.com?nats=MjIuMS4xNy4xOS4wLjAuMC4wLjA","rating":4,"siteOrder":6,"price":"free","tags":[],"features":[],"categories":[{"id":"porn-parody-premium-sites","collection":"categories_en"}],"screenshot_url":"https://cdn.staticstack.net/assets/img/r-thumbs/908df81-cosplayground_small.png","image_alt":"Cosplay Ground, Paid Porn Copy Site","scraped_at":"2025-10-28T20:29:02.112Z","iconSpritesheet":"custom-favicon-spritesheet.png","iconPosition":"-384px -656px","iconClassName":"ctm-icon13173","logoIconClass":"icon13173","pros":["premium cosplay and parody porn","gorgeous pornstars","awesome range of parodies","real free previews","16 scenes and counting"],"cons":["unclear release schedule","no downloads"],"detailedDescription":"<p>I had high hopes for CosplayGround the moment that link slid into my DMs this morning. The name didn’t tell me whether it was a free tube, paysite, photo gallery or what, but the very notion of a cosplay playground was enough to get me all hot, bothered, and eager to take a looksee for myself. Speaking as a guy with a giant cartoon head and raging human boner, I’ve always been partial to seeing beautiful women dressed up as famous characters. What’s hotter: shaking your dick at a Playstation game or an actual pornstar dressed as Lara Croft?</p><p></p><p>If you chose the latter, stick with me, because I think you’re going to enjoy what I found inside. <strong>Cosplayground.com is a new site hawking premium cosplay and parody porn</strong>. The domain’s actually been around a while now, and I’m thrilled to see these guys making good use of it. I clearly ain’t the only one, as their traffic has exploded even in the early days after their launch. Let’s see what all the freaks, geeks, gamers and general perverts are getting into, shall we? Now, where the hell did I put my Batman mask and bottle of lube?</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Beautiful, Horny Women as Your Favorite Characters</h3><p></p><p></p><p>From the moment I landed, I was impressed, intrigued and turned on by two major factors, which I’ve already hinted at. For one thing, <strong>they’re working with some truly gorgeous and talented sex starlets</strong>. Alex stars alongside Val Dodds in a Daphne and Velma parody, and they’ve got Casey Calvert playing Stormfront from The Boys. Brooke Banner, Aiden Starr, Kristina Rose and Haile James are just a few more names, faces, and perfect bodies you may recognize.</p><p></p><p>The other element that had me hard as a rock was the <strong>fantastic range of parodies</strong> they’re putting out. They’re doing X-rated riffs on The Big Bang Theory, Anchorman, Tomb Raider, Entourage and the X-Files, just to name a handful. They’ve got a couple parody scenes based on That 70’s Show, but they’ve got Hyde played by a respectable porn stud who believes in consent instead of a real-life sex criminal like Danny Masterson.</p><p></p><p>The tour page also contains some hints about upcoming Cosplayground content, like a Wednesday porn parody they’re dropping soon. They’ve also got a “Cosplay Community” coming soon, which will showcase “The sexiest cosplay creators from around the world in one place.” They’re currently looking for Cosplayground Creators, so you might want to hit them up if you’re making relevant content.</p><p></p><p>In honor of Matthew Perry, who just drowned the other day, I took in the trailer for Friends: A XXX Parody – Scene 1. Unlike a lot of paysites in 2024, <strong>Cosplayground.com offers guests some free video previews</strong>. This one’s a nearly 3-minute montage of sitcom-style jokes and porno-style hardcore fucking. The production values are clearly high, and I love the sexy, fun vibe.</p><p></p><p>As a professional masturbator and porn reviewer, I couldn’t help noticing some of the logos that slid across the screen in the opening moments. Cosplayground is brought to us by the fine folks at New Sensations. If you’re unfamiliar with the brand, you can check out my review here at MissAVDH, but the short version is that they’re a major player in the industry and known for their high-quality content. My hopes for the site got even higher as I made my way to the signup page.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Step Into the Playground</h3><p></p><p></p><p>The biggest, most obvious disadvantage to signing up for a site this new is that they haven’t had much time to build the collection yet. Cosplayground does a little better than most brand-new sites by front-loading the joint with a nice little stash right from jump. As I type this up, they’ve currently got 16 parody pornos in the library. It ain’t the biggest collection, but it’ll keep you wanking for a while.</p><p></p><p>I know there’s more stuff coming soon, as evidenced by all the pics of sexy characters who aren’t in any current features. Poison Ivy, Wonder Woman and Wednesday look to be on their way, though I can’t say when they’ll arrive. I couldn’t find any upload dates listed anywhere, leaving their release schedule in the dark. I like to see at least one update per week on any paysite, but I can’t tell you if they’re meeting my expectations here.</p><p></p><p>If you were wondering about downloads, well, I’ve got some bad news for you. Cosplayground.com just doesn’t offer them. I couldn’t find a Download button anywhere, nor could I even find an mp4 link when I tried viewing the page source. They’ve got the place locked down, which I know is going to be a bummer for the collectors out there. If you were planning on filling up your hard drive, you may want to pick a different site. If you were just planning on jacking off, then you’re golden.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>My Long-Term Holodeck Fantasies Fulfilled</h3><p></p><p></p><p>They’ve got a parody of Star Trek: The Next Generation and it’s labeled as Scene 1, suggesting they’ve got more futuristic smut in the making. April O’Neil stars as Deanna Troi, who I always thought was the most useless person on the bridge, but also the sexiest. Maybe for the next episode, they can roll Beverly Crusher into the fun.</p><p></p><p>The 23-minute scene opens with a warp-speed view of stars as the credits scroll by. I’m very minorly disappointed there’s no parody of the intro voiceover, but the voice that starts talking after the credits sounds a hell of a lot like Picard. “Captain’s log, star date 46543.2, while on route to Starbase 112, the Enterprise detected electromagnetic energy…”</p><p></p><p>The production values are fucking great, with a nice campiness to it that harkens back to the glory days of VHS smut before reality porn took over. There’s a fair amount of sci-fi setup, but Deanna and Number Two are on the holodeck by the four-minute mark like they’ve scripted it directly from my fantasies. By minute five, Deanna is on her knees with Riker’s big cock in her mouth.</p><p></p><p>This flick speaks directly to my inner nerd, but it stands on its own as a great porno even if you haven’t been jacking off to Deanna Troi fantasies for years. Hell, the younger pervs in the audience may not even recognize the characters, but they will love the fucking and sucking. The camerawork and editing are phenomenal, and frankly, I need to wrap this up so I can enjoy the scene with both hands free.</p><p></p><p>The lack of downloads is easily my biggest complaint about Cosplayground.com, and may be a dealbreaker for some of the budget-minded masturbators out there, especially this early in the game while the collection is still relatively small. That said, this really is some of the best parody porn I’ve seen this year. NewSensations has applied their winning formula of high production values and talented video whores to a niche that’ll appeal deeply to the cosplay fans, geeks and gamers out there on the internet. They’ve got free previews, so I’d recommend starting there and seeing just how hard you get.</p>"}},{"id":"d011e9e5268f","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"d011e9e5268f","title":"Naked News","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"Are you tired of watching the same spam news show every day for almost an hour or two in the United States our only phones will push us something for government inaction and the boring news that the world is about to destroy.

How many times have you been watching the news and about halfway through the broadcast realize that you didn’t catch anything that was said because you were just staring at the female anchors' mesmerizing rack the whole time? Come on, be honest. I know I can’t be alone on this one. We’re guys, we can’t help ourselves.</p><p></p><p>Some of these news anchors, man…god damn. Plus, they’re almost always wearing tops that seem to showcase the tits, with a deep neckline allowing for a full sight of maximum cleavage. Some of these ladies seem to just prop their tits up on a podium. How the fuck am I supposed to hear the words coming out of your mouth when your tits are screaming at me to look at them!?</p><p></p><p>No news is good news. Especially these days, in the clumsy downfall of the American empire. This, of course, only makes it harder for me to pay attention to what that sexy anchor is saying to me. I don’t want to hear about new developments pointing toward collusion with the Russians, or how Trump used his tiny hands to veto a compromise to end the government shutdown. Alongside all the shit I have to deal with in my personal life, it’s just too much fucking stress. I just want that sexy anchor to take her top off. It seems like it might just help to take the edge off.</p><p></p><p>Obviously, this is never going to happen. America is filled with prudes, protestants, and hypocritical religious zealots and priests who would never allow something as obscene as the female nipple on television. Oh, no, that would be far too inappropriate. Jesus would not be pleased. Now, if it were a little boy, then the priests would be cool with it. Hey, don’t be grossed out by me. I’m just reporting the facts.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Naked News: The Natural Progression</h3><p></p><p></p><p>It makes so much sense, honestly, I’m surprised it took so long for someone to make it. I mean, think about it: Naked News. It is ingenious in its simplicity. As you may have assumed, Naked News attracted tons of copycats almost immediately. So, today, there is a handful of different takes on this amazing mode of entertainment, including the French Comedie+ and Norway’s Radio Tango, but none come close to comparing to Naked News in terms of quality.</p><p></p><p>Naked News offers a shit ton of various segments and airs new episodes six days a week. Some of the more popular segments include anchor auditions, naked at the movies, sports, food, and sex and relationships. Other segments include Boob of the Week (eclipsed only by the highly prestigious Boob of the Year, of course), Naked Yogi, Riding in a Car Naked, and Drinking in the Raw. Yes, almost all other segments are equally brilliant in their simplicity.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Site Design Almost as Good as Site Idea</h3><p></p><p></p><p>From the site’s menu bar, feel free to browse the sprawling archives of Naked News. Select either Today’s Show, What You Missed, Blog, Anchors, Archives, Discounts (to other premium adult sites), Live Cams (yes, Naked News has their own cam site), or Store, where you can buy shirts, tanks, mugs, and hats. The merch all looks to be of pretty decent quality, too. My favorite design has printed on it “Fox News” and “CNN,” but both are crossed out; at the bottom of the list, the Naked News logo stands out, unredacted.</p><p></p><p>The blog looks like it gets updated very frequently as well. Nearly every day. And, what’s more, most of the blog posts come with a sexy video to supplement the story alongside the text. Here, you will find additional stories that may have not made it into the daily show for whatever reason, some extra anchor auditions, quizzes, contests, guest blogs, etc. As if new shows 6 days a week wasn’t enough, with all the blog content, you will never run out of sexy news stories to enjoy.</p><p></p><p>The What You Missed section is an awesome way to keep members up to date with a site that is constantly updating. In fact, I wish more porn sites would embrace this feature, especially free porn tubes that are constantly updating. Here, Naked News offers you a customized list of everything that was posted to the site since your last login. Thanks to extremely helpful features like this, you never have to be worried about missing content again. I fucking love this!</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Sexy Anchors are Respected and Admired</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Once you choose the girl you want to check out, you will be brought to an elegant profile page just for her, featuring an enormous banner at the top where she will be posing sexily, some quick facts about her, as well as a considerate and thoughtful bio and every segment she has ever appeared in on Naked News to choose from. Learn your girls’ measurements, turn-ons, turnoffs, specialties (flirting, sensuality, etc.), and hobbies. I love a site that truly respects their models, and I am happy to see that Naked News is one of them.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Poor Fluff to Fap Ratio</h3><p></p><p></p><p>In an ideal world, Naked News would offer separate segments in which some fucking occurred. Even if it was softcore. Actually, what would be awesome is if at the end of each show, the news gradually led into hot lesbian action. That is the only thing that I can think of that would make Naked News better; there should be porn!</p><p></p><p>Surprisingly, porn doesn’t even seem to be a subject touched upon at all in Naked News. There’s not even a porn or adult entertainment section on the site (as far as I can tell). This strikes me as strange. Especially since, even though they may not want to be, Naked News is technically considered a porn site. You’d think they would want to embrace that and work it into the show somehow. This site would lend itself perfectly to interviewing porn stars, no? Both anchor and porn star could chat it up, completely nude. Maybe Naked News is taking themselves a little too seriously as a journalistic outlet.</p><p></p><p>All in all, I love the concept of Naked News. The anchors are sexy, there are plenty of segments to enjoy, a great and regularly updated blog to follow, the site is well-designed, and the show is produced expertly. The news featured on the site, though, tends to be all fluff; which would be fine if only there was some actual porn to fap to. The more fluff there is, the more fapping opportunities there should be. Less fap, less fluff. But the fluff to fap ratio is pretty bad on Naked News, not gonna lie. Definitely an awesome site, but room for improvement abounds.</p>"}},{"id":"9df1da329efa","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"9df1da329efa","title":"WhornyFilms","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"WhornyFilms.com is not just a quality hardcore website, but all the content of the entire XXX Depraved Network is so cheap that hundreds of movies","canonical":"https://theporndude.com/zh/18167/whornyfilms","affiliate_url":"https://landing.whornyfilms.com/","rating":4,"siteOrder":8,"price":"free","tags":[],"features":[],"categories":[{"id":"porn-parody-premium-sites","collection":"categories_en"}],"screenshot_url":"https://cdn.staticstack.net/assets/img/r-thumbs/029ab5c-whornyfilms_small.png","image_alt":"WhornyFilms, Paid Porn Imitation Site","scraped_at":"2025-10-28T20:29:13.433Z","iconSpritesheet":"custom-favicon-spritesheet.png","iconPosition":"-128px -848px","iconClassName":"ctm-icon18167","logoIconClass":"icon18167","pros":["premium hardcore fuck flicks","lots of free video trailers","a wide variety of deep perversion","hot pornstars and rising starlets","five paysites for one price","cheaper than your average premium site","2 updates per week","more than 500 movies in the catalog so far","downloads included"],"cons":["doesn’t look like they include evil erotic (yet?)"],"detailedDescription":"<p>What’s in a name?

Their traffic is strong, which suggests their strategy is working, but I bet a million bucks the dirty movies are an even bigger part of their winning formula.</p><p></p><p><strong>WhornyFilms.com hawks premium hardcore smut in a beautifully kinky variety of flavors</strong>. The site’s been around for a few years now and has been growing steadily, both in terms of their fanbase and their expanding library of perversion on video. I hate to give a huge spoiler right in the beginning of the review, but I know a lot of you are going to click the link before I can tell you this: they’ve got a whole network of paysites included for one low-ass price. The entry fee ain’t the only thing I’m excited already about, so let’s get into all the reasons I’m so hard right now.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Are You Feeling Whorny?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>This sure as hell doesn’t look like the work of a new studio just figuring out how to shoot sex. The current preview offers a peek at a classic medical-themed porno, with a handful of gorgeous pornstars getting their pussies and their faces stuffed at the doctor’s office. Every element looks beautiful, from the well-lit, well-framed shots to the clean-ass hospital set, to the utterly gorgeous models, titties jiggling as they receive their health infusions.</p><p></p><p>There’s a longer trailer if tap the Play button, and that ain’t the only freebie. <strong>WhornyFilms.com has plenty of free video trailers for both the curious and the cheap</strong>. I took in some samples, including cosplay pornos with characters like Wonder Woman and Catwoman, BDSM lesbian encounters, some ass-fucking with a squirting crescendo, and a whole-ass orgy envisioned with an old-time cathouse vibe.</p><p></p><p><strong>Whorny Films carries a nice, wide, and hard variety of XXX-rated content</strong>. Between the bondage elements and all the butt stuff, it feels at least a little bit more depraved than your average reality porn collection. The production values, though, are far higher than you’d get with your average fetish porn outfit out there. I’m not sure where the hell these guys came from, but they’re not skimping on anything and clearly know what they’re doing.</p><p></p><p>They shoot with a lot of Euro pornstars, so American fans may not recognize quite as many faces as they would from another casting site coming out of Los Angeles, but I spotted a few. <strong>WhornyFilms.com features a nice variety of famous pornstars and rising starlets</strong>, and I didn’t spot a single uggo among them. Aletta Ocean, Julia Ann, Kagney Linn, and Alexis Texas are just a few of my favorites off that picture menu of video whores.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Get Your XXX Kicks on the Cheap</h3><p></p><p></p><p>I appreciate a good five-for-one deal whether we’re talking about appetizers, pre-rolls or porn sites, but this one is an even better deal than I thought. It’s a package bundle costing less than your typical singular paysite. The current rate is just twenty bones a month, while the industry standard is about ten bucks more; I charge $30 for MissAVDHCasting, as do most paysites. They’ve got sweet deals on longer rates, too, including a yearly plan for a penny under a hundo.</p><p></p><p>The perks are higher than your average one-off premium joint, too. They’re promising two updates per week, while most of the other guys are just dropping one. Networks like this are usually conservative in their estimates, too. With five sites in the lineup, I think there’s a damn good chance you’ll get more than two updates per week, giving you more reasons to stop by on your daily wank routine.</p><p></p><p>WhornyFilms.com ain’t the oldest premium porn spot on the block, but they’ve been around long enough and been busy enough to have built a hell of a collection already. As of this writing, <strong>there are over 500 Whorny Films in the stash</strong>. That’s the number listed out front, but just looking at the video index, I think there’s a lot more.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>I Was Whorny, So This is What I Did</h3><p></p><p></p><p>I saw a lot of movies I’ll be whacking off to in my free time, but I had some professional masturbation to do first. Since I’d already seen a preview of the very latest film, that ER orgy I mentioned, I figured I’d start with their second-latest drop. Anal Party 2 is a 20-minute group butt-sex movie starring the stunning Sabrina Sweet, whose pretty face and sweet cheeks I couldn’t resist.</p><p></p><p>It's got another classic porno setup, with Sabrina playing the delivery girl coming by with some takeaway. The shirtless guy tips her a tenner for looking so good in her little skirt, fishnets and bare midriff, plus some a few more bucks on top. The guys want to party, and Sabrina is 100% down. She dances around, shaking her ass and grinding it on the gentlemen, who forget all about their hunger almost immediately. Now, they’re just thirsty as hell.</p><p></p><p>After a bit of teasing, the cocks come out around five minutes in, and then they go straight into Sabrina’s mouth. The girl puts the Whore and the Horny in Whorny Films, and I was getting just as excited as the dudes on the screen. Everybody involved actually does get a good meal in before they start stuffing her twat and her face at the same time. She diddles herself while they finger cuff her, and then it’s time to slam that butthole.</p><p></p><p>It's a mouthwatering scene, with top-shelf camerawork to ensure we don’t miss any of the best bits. The eager level of perversion is probably one of my favorite elements: the chick is gorgeous, sexually talented, and man, she ain’t holding back one bit. <strong>Downloads are included</strong>, so this one is now a part of my permanent collection.</p><p></p><p>I’d recommend a look at WhornyFilms.com to anybody who loves their porn hard and well made, especially if you’re looking for a deal on high-end filth. The whole network is cheaper than your average paysite, and frankly, the whole place feels a little dirtier in all the right ways. They don’t have quite as many recognizable faces as some of the big American pornography brands, but they more than make up for the lack of star power with incredible fucking, sucking and everything else, captured on video by masters of the craft. They’ve got plenty of free previews, so I’d start there.</p>"}}]

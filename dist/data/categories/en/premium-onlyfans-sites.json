Remember back in August, when OnlyFans suddenly announced they would ban adult content in a few months? Well, they quickly walked back the statement, but not before damaging the ever-loving fuck out of their own brand. Even after assuring DIY models, Insta-celebrities, and camwhores they’d be safe on the platform, the site continues to see an exodus of creators who think OnlyFans can go suck a dick. Guess where those fed-up OnlyFans girls are going?</p><p></p><p>You can look at the traffic graphs if you don’t believe me, but a few months ago, Fansly.com was just a tiny blip on the internet, a forsaken island that could only ever dream of being the next big social media porn platform. Well, until OnlyFans made their stupid announcement, at which point Fansly shot from two to twenty-five million visitors a month. <strong>You could call the site a knock-off or alternative to OnlyFans</strong>, which would be a fair assessment, but what really separates it from the original? I figured the best way to find out would be to lube up and shake my dick around, so let’s hope I don’t get kicked out of Starbucks before I can finish my review.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Looks a Lot Like OF to Me</h3><p></p><p></p><p>The outside setup is so clean that, unlike most porn sites, grandma might even go away unoffended. You can’t see a damn thing on Fansly without signing up and logging in first. After going through the 10-second signup process, though, it becomes even more apparent what the site is all about.</p><p></p><p>Once you log in, the member’s area is a familiar feed of content you’ve seen on pretty much every social media or social porn website. However, since it’ll be your first time and you’re not following anybody, they offer a few suggestions along the side of the screen. The very first babe they recommended was none other than Amouranth, aiming her ass at the camera and hiding almost nothing with a couple of thin black straps in her little thumbnail shot. In case you just escaped a cave, she’s one of the biggest current stars of this new amateur genre and recently made internet headlines after being banned from almost every other online platform.</p><p></p><p>I quickly filled up my feed with sexy recommendations. Since Fansly.com only really took off recently, I was worried it would be populated by second-tier wannabes, washed-up has-beens, and full-on uglies. Instead, <strong>I found a nice mix of established internet chicks and plenty of newbie homemade starlets</strong>. Of course, there are some dudes and trannies on the platform, but based on the recommendations they gave a completely new user, it’s safe to say most of their creators are the type of Insta models, cosplay chicks, and webcam pornstars you find on similar sites.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>How Do I Find the Good Stuff?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Until then, though, you’ll have to wait until models you follow elsewhere give out their Fansly.com link. The only alternative is to choose from the girls who pop up in the Suggestions sidebar. I know it’s only giving me a limited selection—likely determined by who’s trending, who’s paying, or some combination of the two—but I do like how the site has a wide range of content.</p><p></p><p>Just scrolling through content put out by the dozen or so random girls I followed, I see BDSM photoshoots, stripteases, naked yoga, foot fetish fantasies, masturbation, some full-on sex, and a ton of cosplay. The diversity of crank material visible here alone makes the site’s lack of searchability even more of a shame. I wish I could just click on tags to jump from the dildos to the tit-wanks to the MILFs to fetish models.</p><p></p><p>I got a little curious about what was allowed and what wasn’t, so I checked out the Fansly.com terms of service. It’s more or less the same set of basic standards you find elsewhere. Almost anything legal goes, but they draw the line at taboo, shitting and puking, animal stuff, and hateful content. Those are community standards that you find on most porn sites, especially ones accepting payments. The credit card companies don’t fuck around when it comes to content.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Get More of Less for Your Money</h3><p></p><p></p><p>You’ll see the implications of this all on your feed. I like how this setup lets models release both free and paid material from the same account instead of making you subscribe to different profiles like on OnlyFans. The big drawback is that your feed will also be cluttered up with empty boxes where all the locked content stays hidden.</p><p></p><p>It’s a neat feature, but will it be enough to draw creators and users over from OnlyFans? I’m not sure, but I think fans are going to follow wherever their favorite models go. Both sites have the same basic setup, where you can subscribe directly to adult content put out by the same chicks you’ve been jerking off to on social media. But, again, both sites offer the same social media-style direct access to the chicks, where you can hop into their DMs or give them a tip for some custom content. That’s one of the magic elements that made the genre what it is, that bit of unfuckable intimacy you can’t get from the big studios.</p><p></p><p>Fansly.com was offering models a bigger cut of the profits for a while, but now they’ve backed down to the same 20% OnlyFans pays out. That isn’t surprising because OnlyFans is still big enough to set the standards for these types of DIY porn sale platforms. That begs the question of just what they’re doing to lure creators over, well, other than hoping for the ill will toward OnlyFans to keep burning on its own. The whole thing does seem built to deliver but still needs more meat in the stockroom.</p><p></p><p>The lack of searchability makes it kind of hard to recommend Fansly for a quick fap right now, but the same can be said of OnlyFans. Either site might be perfect for the occasion, but it depends a lot on which of your favorite models are posting material to the platform. The random suggestions they give you in the sidebar offer an okay place to start looking, but I think users aren’t really going to get hooked until they see more girls posting their Fansly.com link on their other social media accounts. However, based on the snowballing traffic, I think that time may be coming.</p>"}},{"id":"f65722a71882","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"f65722a71882","title":"FanCentro","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"You can find access to social media permissions for your favorite sexy internet celebrity model amateurs and AV actresses on FanCentro.com with free Snapchat and Instagram stories or pay to watch truly private intimate things and then...","canonical":"https://theporndude.com/zh/4625/fancentro","affiliate_url":"https://fancentro.com/?foxref=v0ZBaRkb","rating":5,"siteOrder":9,"price":"premium","tags":["免费","付费"],"features":[],"categories":[{"id":"premium-onlyfans-sites","collection":"categories_en"}],"screenshot_url":"https://cdn.staticstack.net/assets/img/r-thumbs/6d35a_fancentro_small.jpg","image_alt":"FanCentro, Premium OnlyFans Website","scraped_at":"2025-10-28T19:20:44.120Z","iconSpritesheet":"default","logoIconClass":"icon278","pros":["social media access to pornstars","exclusive xxx content","huge menu of exhibitionist influencers","smut for any budget"],"cons":["not always clear what you’re actually buying","so many payment and subscription options"],"detailedDescription":"<p>Fan Centro! I’ve got something of an obsession with social media. It seems like every year, the girls get a little sluttier, trying to outdo each other in who can show the most skin. It’s hot when girls are willing to make out for the camera, but my favorite influencers are the ones who seem like genuine nymphomaniacs. I’m talking about the ones willing to suck a cock or ride some dude in the back of a car while someone takes a video. Those are the kinds of girls you’ll find at FanCentro.</p><p></p><p>FanCentro.com is a website that lists all the hottest influencers, models and porn stars on various social media platforms. They don’t just have links to Instagram, Snapchat, and Pornhub, but also offer exclusive access to private FanCentro feeds that feature even more perverted social media goodness. The site has been around since 2016 and has more followers than your mom. As of this writing, they’re getting around 13,000 visitors every day.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Social Media for Deviates and Perverts</h3><p></p><p></p><p>I recognize a lot of these big-boobed beauties from my regular fap routine. Teanna Trump, Lana Rhoades, and Lela Star all have positions near the very top of the page. MILF Cherie DeVille is bending over with a shopping basket in her hand, and Riley Reid looks like a goddamn sex pixie in her mirror selfie.</p><p></p><p>A high level of sexiness is standard, but I see all kinds of gorgeous women here. There are blondes, brunettes, and redheads to gawk at. You can fap to White girls, Black girls, Latinas are Asians. I see skinny girls, athletic babes, and BBW hotties. Big boobs, small boobs, tattoos, piercings, whatever — it looks like just about everything is on the menu here. A lot of these chicks have BDSM or Fetish tags in the profile, so even the real degenerates have plenty to beat off to.</p><p></p><p>The meat market view is similar to the wall of thumbnails on a lot of porno sites, but the filters are definitely a little bit different. They’ve got one for deals, and another for tags, and the regular options for sorting like Best-Selling, Most Viewed, or Newly Added. It’s the social media filters, though, that I’ve never seen on any free tube or premium whore haven.</p><p></p><p>The filter options include three icons: a ghost for Snapchat, a camera for Instagram, and the letter A with a star for the FanCentro logo. Clicking any of them narrows down the selection to girls active on that particular platform. This pornographic social media consolidation is what the website is all about, so let’s take a closer look at how it works.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Slide Into Some Pornstar DMs</h3><p></p><p></p><p>I clicked the Follow button to follow her on FanCentro. I could do this at no charge with my free account, but a button below her blurb offers Snapchat access starting at 20 bucks a month. That’s actually the three-month rate; if you just want access for a month, that will run you a cool 25. Enter your Snapchat username, pay up, and slide into those DMs.</p><p></p><p>Abella doesn’t have any other premium social media accounts listed on FanCentro, maybe because she’s too busy starring in that high-budget smut. Other influencers and Internet freaks have more to offer.</p><p></p><p>Naughty gamer girl IRageBabe’s profile has a link to add her for free on Snapchat, and another to subscribe to her exclusive FanCentro content starting at $6.25 per month. Amateur Asian cutie has premium FanCentro stuff for a monthly fee or a permanent Snapchat subscription for 26 bones. This chick is really making the most of social media, with links in her profile to both public and private Snapchat, Instagram, Twitter, Reddit, and Tumblr.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Premium Insta-Porn for Any Budget</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Some of you perverts are going to find this convenient, because you can find premium social media porn for whatever your budget is. Others might be annoyed, because it can get a little bit convoluted. If you’re the type who ends up spending a shit ton of money on cam sites, you may want to set a budget before you go poking around on FanCentro.</p><p></p><p>They do have a button at the top of the front page to slim the pickings down to deals only. There are a lot of fucking deals here, with maybe half the Instagram sluts and Snapchat whores offering anywhere from 10 to 90% off. The cynical penny pincher in me thinks the supposedly discounted rates might be the regular prices, but the depraved pervert in me is already pulling out my wallet. Half off ain’t bad if she’s taking it all off.</p><p></p><p>Really, my biggest problem with the pricing scheme is that you don’t always know exactly what you’re going to get; there are no previews for private social media accounts. This isn’t necessarily FanCentro’s fault, as they can’t really police what girls post on other platforms, nor can they force content out of them on their own. A lot of the models and influencers here promise daily updates in their bio blurbs, but there’s no real guarantee.</p><p></p><p>If a babe has a premium FanCentro feed available, you can get a vague idea of what’s on it without subscribing. The Feed link in a profile leads to said feed, whether you’ve paid up or not. Everything is blurred out for nonsubscribers, but you can at least see how often they post and how much material is already available. Post titles like Fuck Me Photo Set, Sexy Striptease, and Riding a Huge Cock tell you a lot about the content even without visual confirmation.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>The Next Wave of Amateur DIY Porn?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>The site has a unique and new format that wouldn’t have worked a decade ago, but it is a perfect fit for today’s era of social media exhibitionism and DIY home porn empires. I love how it treats the professional pornstars and Internet amateurs the same, leaving it up to them and their fans to see who rises to the top.</p><p></p><p>FanCentro.com is an easy site to recommend to anybody who loves the immediacy of social media and the open perversion of pornography. It consolidates links and profiles for some of the most beautiful women in the world, making it incredibly easy to find your favorite babe’s content all around the Internet. Whether you’re looking for free selfies on Instagram, private hookups on Snapchat, or exclusive smut on FanCentro’s own platform, these guys have got you covered.</p>"}},{"id":"64abea19eb64","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"64abea19eb64","title":"LoverFans","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"LoverFans.com is a brand new XXX social networking and content platform that offers more free content and better search capabilities than OnlyFans 26k creators and is still growing in a wide range","canonical":"https://theporndude.com/zh/9050/loverfans","affiliate_url":"https://loverfans.com/the-chick-next-door?utm_source=GC1984&utm_medium=LFaffiliates&utm_campaign=income_porndude&ref=507093&af=GC1984","rating":4,"siteOrder":10,"price":"free","tags":["免费"],"features":[],"categories":[{"id":"premium-onlyfans-sites","collection":"categories_en"}],"screenshot_url":"https://cdn.staticstack.net/assets/img/r-thumbs/3d91ce4-loverfans_small.png","image_alt":"LoverFans, Premium OnlyFans Website","scraped_at":"2025-10-28T19:20:55.855Z","iconSpritesheet":"default","logoIconClass":"icon1326","pros":["adult social network and content platform","26k creators","102k videos and 106k photos","previews and free content galore","easier to browse and search than onlyfans","model subscriptions, vod and live streams","physical object sales, too"],"cons":["prices start adding up for heavy consumers"],"detailedDescription":"<p>Lover Fans calls itself “The Uncensored Social Network for TOP Influencers,” which honestly sounds a lot like another site with a similar name. While they only get a fraction of the traffic OnlyFans pulls, their numbers have been rising steadily in a way that tells me they might have something special up their sleeves. Models have been jumping ship from OnlyFans for a while, and I’ve been wondering where they’re going. Could it be LoverFans?</p><p></p><p>It's one thing to call yourself THE BEST FAN PLATFORM in red, all capital letters out on the landing page, but it’s another thing entirely to actually be the best. That’s why I was so curious to see what I could see at LoverFans.com, <strong>an adult social network and content platform aimed at horny grownups</strong>. I just got banned from Instagram again, so maybe this is exactly what I’ve been looking for, but there’s only one way to be sure. Now, where’d I put my lotion and my silicone butthole?</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Please, Sir, Can I Have a Peek?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Like anybody who’s been on the internet for more than a few minutes, I really don’t like to type my email address into a form unless it’s totally necessary. That’s how you get your inbox blown up with spam. I knew LoverFans.com was going to be worth ponying up some basic contact info, though, because they tell you out front how many models are adding material. As of this writing, they’ve got 26,000 creators. I’m one man putting out some incredible smut over at MissAVDHCasting, but could you imagine an army of 26,000 MissAVDHs banging out the stuff?</p><p></p><p>Those creators have been pretty fucking busy, too. The current library stands at 102,000 videos and 106,000 photos. I imagine it’d cost you a fucking fortune to unlock every single one of them, but it’s the possibilities that get my brain ticking and my cock tingling. The front page states that “Hot Instagrammers, Tiktokkers and streamers are welcome,” and well, those are exactly my type of sluts. Say what you want about the weird effects social media has on society, but the attention-whore format sure has been good for masturbators.</p><p></p><p>Oh, and hey, if you still ain’t convinced it’s worth giving you’re your email address, they’ve got some more to show you. My biggest beef with OnlyFans has always been the near total lack of previews, but <strong>LoverFans.com has a ton of sneak peeks and free content</strong>. They even let you browse a bit of it before you even sign up. Just click that Discover LoverFans link out front and it’ll serve up a ton of free content selected from the site’s Top Models and Newest content.</p><p></p><p>I won’t lie: I treated myself to some of those freebies before I actually signed up for an account. A gorgeous, thick Latina with red lips pouted at me from the Discover page, and I clicked through to her full profile. The girl’s got dozens of premium pics and vids, but the 3 freebies were easy to find by clicking the Free button. I ended up needing a break from writing this, because her no-cost material included a big nudie gallery and a couple amateur sex videos.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Running My Sticky Fingers Through the Pile</h3><p></p><p></p><p>As with other social networks, clean or dirty, LoverFans drops you off in your custom feed as soon as you log in. If you’re brand new and haven’t yet subscribed to or followed any of the Lovers, that feed is going to be filled with Recommended Content. I was a little bit disappointed to see that nearly everything in my starter feed is locked, with price tags over blurred-out images. Yesterday I visited their extreme-sex sister site, Scatbook, and found a lot more freebies mixed in with the locked premium content in my first feed.</p><p></p><p>I ain’t that mad, though. Want to know why? It’s because, unlike OnlyFans, they offer some really useful ways to browse and search the site. Clicking the Stars icon in the sidebar, for example, brings you to some of most popular chicks on the site, including that Latina I was gawking at earlier. I also see that Gia Derza has an account on the site. I had a huge porn crush on Gia even before I’d banged her on MissAVDHCasting couch, so I was excited to see her here.</p><p></p><p>I do wish they had a browsable menu of Categories or Tags, but found the search bar to be a suitable replacement. Type your favorite genre into the OnlyFans search bar and you’ll be lucky to find many models, since they only search through usernames and your own purchased content. On LoverFans.com, the search function quickly delivered scores of models and posts for any keyword or subgenre I typed in.</p><p></p><p>Needless to say, there’s an incredible range amateur of content here. I found Asian porn and anal, lesbians, blowjobs and orgies. Kinkier stuff was easy to find, too, like feet, BDSM, cosplay and ASMR. If that’s still too vanilla for you, check out my review of Scatbook, which is basically the same but with a lot more poop smeared everywhere.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>How Do You Want Your Amateur Porn</h3><p></p><p></p><p>They’ve also got live streams, and I really hope to see some growth in this section of the website. The pickings are slim compared to the dedicated webcam sex sites, but I think the format is perfect for it. Instead of watching some rando who happens to be performing, you can have a live fap to one of your social media crushes.</p><p></p><p>Finally, <strong>you can also buy physical objects from the Lovers of LoverFans</strong>. During my visit, I didn’t find too many models offering up anything tangible, but I like that the option exists. As the site grows and its ranks increase, I think this has the potential to be one of the site’s biggest draws. In the meantime, those of you in need of some sniffable feminine musk can check out my Buy Used Panties section here at MissAVDH.</p><p></p><p>As I’ve been writing up this review, I’ve been clicking the Follow button on my favorite profiles. A couple hours after first loading up the site, my feed is now populated by big butts and big boobs, amateur sex and cosplay sluts. I’ve got a couple DMs from the babes, too, so I have a feeling this joint is going to keep me entertained all weekend, to say the least.</p><p></p><p>LoverFans.com may not yet have the same popularity or the same size as OnlyFans, but they’ve got some features that make for a more convenient experience. The site is easy to search and has a ton of free content to get excited about, and you don’t even have to sign up to start looking around.

They only launched recently, but their traffic has been rising by millions in just their first few months. Could this be the next big thing?</p><p></p><h3>Flirt with Real Women Who Flirt Back</h3><p></p><p></p><p>The presentation is attractive, but the basic premise doesn’t sound all that different from most of the other content platforms I’ve reviewed. “Flirtback is a premium subscription site for like-minded Flirtmates, ready to share their stories, nude pictures, sexy thoughts, and fantasies through text, pictures, or videos with you in a completely private way.”</p><p></p><p>They go on to hype their built-in chat features, going as far as selling the wait times between texts as “breaking the current trend of instant gratification.” One thing that stood out to me is that you can start sexting even before you go premium. The intimacy of interaction is one of the biggest selling points of OnlyFans, but it’s typically limited to paying fans of any particular model.</p><p></p><p><strong>Users get 15 free trial messages when they match with any new creator</strong>. After burning through those, you’ll have to subscribe to a creator to keep the chat going. This is supposed to ensure compatibility between Flirtmates, though I wonder how many potential models it scares away from the platform. The cheapskates will love the feature, but it might require more effort from the models to earn those subscription bucks. The upsides and downsides seem pretty fucking obvious.</p><p></p><p>There’s so much emphasis on sexting in the tour area of FlirtBack.com that I think I should mention that the whole thing is anonymous. It works just like anything else on the internet, regardless of what terminology they’re using to equate their chats with SMS. You don’t have to give up your name, face or phone number.</p><p></p><p>You can and probably will use a phone to Flirt Back, though. I always write these reviews from a desktop because it’s easier than typing with my thumbs, but they’ve got an app available for Android or iPhone. Technically, it’s a PWA (Progressive Web App), not a real mobile app, and works with your browser. Installation basically just adds a link to your home screen.</p><p></p><h3>How Many Babes Are Really Flirting Back?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>A trip to the Creators page only seemed to confirm my suspicions. The lists of Male and Trans Flirtmates are so short you barely have to scroll to reach the end. The picture menu of Female Flirtmates, on the other hand, offered up hundreds of babes to choose from, include 12 of the newest, 12 of the hottest, 12 near me, 12 online now and 450 listed as Other Creators.</p><p></p><p>I’m only a little bit disappointed not to find the thousands suggested out front, because I really didn’t think I’d find this many creators on a content platform this new. They’re probably counting all signups toward the front-page total, which is misleading but not too surprising.</p><p></p><p>They’ve got a nice range of babes, too. It’s a diverse spread featuring everyone from slutty superhero cosplay chicks to bikini models, ebony knockouts to thick Latinas, freshly legal 18-year-old teens to sexy, sultry MILFs. There are slim girls, busty broads and straight-up BBWs; blondes, brunettes, redheads and pink-haired emo girls; girls next door, pornstar bimbos, sophisticated ladies and cruel doms in BDSM gear.</p><p></p><p>Even with just 500 women to choose from, I really wish Flirt Back had some basic search functions built in. Ideally, I’d like a set of filters like you find on the better webcam and dating sites, letting you click some keyword-loaded boxes to find the girl of your wet dreams. A regular ol’ search bar would work wonders, too. The only way to find your ideal Flirtmate right now is to look at all the pics and click on the pretty ones.</p><p></p><h3>Who Wants to Talk Dirty with MissAVDH?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>If you’re looking to Flirt Back right now without waiting for a reply, you’ve got your pick of the Happy Hour girls and a selection of girls who are Online Now. I’m not sure it actually shows all the online girls, though, because it was always exactly a dozen during my visit.</p><p></p><p>I sent a couple messages without subscribing first, just to see what happens. I wasn’t sure I’d get any responses, but I was pleasantly surprised when a hot Polish chick hit me right back. “Hi naughty boy,” she wrote, adding a winking emoji. You may not have a 100% success rate with the freebies, but it certainly can’t hurt.</p><p></p><p>FlirtBack.com has a lot of familiar features, like the ability to tip the creators right in the chat window. After starting a conversation, I gave a girl a tip to sweeten her up, much like I’d do on a cam site. The rest, as they say, is history, or at least a wet, sticky spot underneath my desk.</p><p></p><p>After you use your free messages, you’ll have to sign up as a subscriber to keep the conversation going. Unlike OnlyFans, where prices vary all over the fucking place, you can get access to a Flirtmate’s content and slide into her DMs for €9.99 a month. I really like the simple, one-size-fits-all pricing scheme here, even if I worry it might scare off the higher-end cam girls, pornstars and fetish models.</p><p></p><p>FlirtBack.com is still in its early days, but the platform is promising. I’m impressed by how many models have signed up already, giving users a nice selection of women to chat with and crank off to. This is only going to improve with time, and I’m looking forward to seeing how they integrate more features as the site continues to develop and grow. A good search function will go a long way in improving the usability, so I’d put that at the top of my wish list. If you ain’t quite sold on the concept just yet, take advantage of those free messages and see how they work out for you.</p>"}},{"id":"d24fdab05400","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"d24fdab05400","title":"Xpanded","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"Xpanded.comfanclubs is a website that can subscribe to many British models","canonical":"https://theporndude.com/zh/13328/xpandedfanclubs","affiliate_url":"https://xpanded.com/updates/fan-clubs/most-popular-fanclubs?aff=MissAVDH","rating":4,"siteOrder":12,"price":"free","tags":[],"features":[],"categories":[{"id":"premium-onlyfans-sites","collection":"categories_en"}],"screenshot_url":"https://cdn.staticstack.net/assets/img/r-thumbs/07700f4-xpandedfanclubs_small.png","image_alt":"Xpanded, Premium OnlyFans Website","scraped_at":"2025-10-28T19:21:23.340Z","iconSpritesheet":"default","logoIconClass":"icon1980","pros":["find fan pages of sexy uk models","over 1700 fan pages","easy to sort fan pages","know the services, cost, and number of posts in each listing"],"cons":["nothing"],"detailedDescription":"<p>Are you in the UK and looking for sexy models that will make you bust a nut right where you sit? Or rather, are you looking for a fan club with a beautiful up and coming model that will give you the kind of content that you are looking for? While you could go to other sites that I have reviewed in the past here on MissAVDH, I have another option that you can use!</p><p></p><p>What option is that you may be fucking asking me? I am glad that you asked! This site I am referring to is called Xpanded.com/Fan Clubs, and it is fucking here and now that you will find all kinds of awesome and engaging models with fan clubs that you can join and have a fun time in each and every visit!</p><p></p><p>There is a little something for everyone here on Xpanded.com/Fan Clubs, and if you are in the market to join a stunning model’s fan club and request some of the most delicious goodies that she has to offer, then you are going to want to be here on this unique platform. See what’s available just for you here today on Xpanded.com/Fan Clubs. You’re going to enjoy all of the different models that you find here on Xpanded.com/Fan Clubs, and I know that you’ll be glad that I told you all about it!</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Find fan pages of sexy babes</h3><p></p><p></p><p>You are also going to be comparing Xpanded.com/Fan Clubs to OnlyFans. It’s a natural given, and unsurprising. But, Xpanded.com/Fan Clubs differs from OnlyFans. Sure, it’s a way that you can get unique content from certain models that turn you on, but that’s just about where the similarities end.</p><p></p><p>For starters, you can browse all of the models that have a fan club on Xpanded.com/Fan Clubs. OnlyFans does not allow that to happen, as you need to know the URL of the model that you want to look at. There isn’t a browsing option on OnlyFans: you just have to know where to find a specific model.</p><p></p><p>Xpanded.com/Fan Clubs does not play those games, though. If you arrive on Xpanded.com/Fan Clubs wanting to subscribe to a model, this is easy to do. More than likely, you will leave the site having subscribed to a model (or maybe even a few!).</p><p></p><p>Finding models on Xpanded.com/Fan Clubs is very simple, and it couldn’t be easier finding a model that you want to subscribe to. Once you select a model that you want to look at, you will also notice that you easily browse the kinds of services that they have to offer. Meaning that you can absolutely subscribe to a person on Xpanded.com/Fan Clubs AFTER knowing the amenities that they provide (for the most part, anyway). This goes a long way toward helping you to avoid any models that you may not want to subscribe to, or may not deliver the kinds of services that you are hoping for.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Easy to see their services</h3><p></p><p></p><p>When you look at all of the different services that are available on Xpanded.com/Fan Clubs, what you will find right away is that you know precisely what kind of content and services that they are delivering to you. There is no mystery surrounding the kinds of amenities that are on the table here, so take a good hard look at all of them right away, and I know for certain that you are going to enjoy just how simple it is to find just what you are looking for.</p><p></p><p>So what kinds of services do some of these models actually provide on Xpanded.com/Fan Clubs? I noticed that many of the fan pages offer services like video call, voice call, collaboration description, and more. Each of these services also feature the rate that it is going to cost you, so you don’t have to wonder if you’re going to be priced out or not before you subscribe to them.</p><p></p><p>It makes me have to say mother fuckers that Xpanded.com/Fan Clubs makes the process of finding the kinds of fan pages and models that you want to subscribe to, that it could just make you wish that other platforms were this convenient. While Xpanded.com/Fan Clubs certainly doesn’t have the number of models that a behemoth like OnlyFans has, that’s fucking fine as hell. And besides, Xpanded.com/Fan Clubs is the premier site for subscribing to sexy models in the UK anyway!</p><p></p><p></p><h3>THE place for UK model fan clubs</h3><p></p><p></p><p>That would be fucking ridiculous on your end, and no, I’m not coming over and wiping the cum of anguish off your face, either. That’s for your mother to do, not me! Get it together!</p><p></p><p>Xpanded.com/Fan Clubs has a gorgeous selection of UK models, each with fan clubs that you can join. And as you look at the number of posts that are available for each specific fan page, what you will notice straight up is that there is no mystery regarding how active these models are on Xpanded.com/Fan Clubs, either. Why the fuck do I say that?</p><p></p><p>I’ll tell you all about it! Before you even select the listing of a model on Xpanded.com/Fan Clubs, you will see a number. That signifies the number of posts the model has listed in their fan club. That way, you will know exactly which models are the most active on Xpanded.com/Fan Clubs, and which ones are only posting here and there, allowing you to figure out which ones are worth a subscription, or which ones you should pass on by.</p><p></p><p>It's a convenient way to speed up your looking, letting you to easily figure out which fan clubs you should consider. And when you’re ready to subscribe, that’s easy as fuck too! Just select that subscribe option, and from there, you will be on your fucking way to getting all of the latest updates from that model directly on Xpanded.com/Fan Clubs!</p><p></p><p>Finding the kinds of fan clubs that you want to subscribe to is easy too!

I’m certainly not complaining, as I think the site’s offerings are much more enticing than brain freeze and diabetes. Speaking as a porn webmaster and the guy who runs PornWebmasters.com, it’s just wild to me that the dot com was even available, and that it’s now serving up next-gen amateur porn with a super-modern interface.</p><p></p><p>That’s right, folks: <strong>Slushy.com is a freemium social porn platform delivering short videos by the buttload</strong>. They’ve called themselves “TikTok gone wild”, which I think is an apt description. Their traffic has been steadily rising lately, with about a million perverts tuning in for a peek last month alone. I’m crazy about DIY smut and I love the rapid-fire format of apps like TikTok, so I couldn’t wait to lube up and shake my dick at the screen. Let me tell you all about it!</p><p></p><p></p><h3>TikTok Meets OnlyFans</h3><p></p><p></p><p>I don’t think the rise of TikTok has the same kind of direct correlation to social distancing, but the format’s a perfect fit for our declining attention spans. I’ve reviewed a fair number of free video tubes that ape the TikTok interface with different degrees of success, and I knew right away Slushy was something a little bigger and better.</p><p></p><p>As well as those other sites emulate TikTok, they’ve typically got a pretty low-fi vibe. I see a lot of low-resolution clips that look like they were scraped from whatever free tube or social media site they could find. Slushy ramps up the production values with videos that just look better, as well as a presentation with a few more bells and whistles. It’s obvious they put some real money into this one.</p><p></p><p>It takes money to make money, right? One of the things that separates Slushy.com from the other adult TikTok clones is an <strong>OnlyFans-style subscription model where you can follow your favorite models for a few bucks</strong>. I really like how it’s implemented, too: swipe on a free booty-shaking or titty-flashing clip and you have an opportunity to see more for a price. One of my longstanding complaints about OnlyFans is how it’s basically impossible to find new models directly on the platform itself, and I think Slushy’s solution is beautiful.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Sexy Women at the Swipe of a Thumb</h3><p></p><p></p><p>You’ll want to sign up for an account even if you aren’t planning on buying into any of the premium stuff. Yeah, I know it sucks to give out an email address if you don’t have to, but you’ll get a lot of nag screens until you do. More importantly, setting up an account lets you set your preferences and follow your favorite models. Naturally, I slid the content slider beyond SFW and NSFW into Adult territory.</p><p></p><p>They offer up a nice selection of Featured Models as the last step of the registration process, so I stocked my feed with cosplay cuties, big booty thick girls, Asian babes and Latina knockouts. There’s a beautiful range of beautiful women, and you may even recognize some if you’re a fan of social media porno. Amouranth was among those Featured chicks, and yeah, I hit Follow as soon as I saw her red hair and pretty face.</p><p></p><p>You don’t have to enter a payment method right away, but they make sure to remind you what you’re missing. Slushy.com feels a lot like TikTok meets OnlyFans, as the perks include private text messages, custom requests and personal media swapping. You can even do uncensored video calls straight from the platform, which ain’t even a given on the OnlyFans clones out there.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Getting to the Good Stuff with Slushy</h3><p></p><p></p><p>I’ve spent a fair amount of time talking about Slushy’s premium setup, but <strong>there’s a ton of free material for the cheapskates out there</strong>. You’ll still get nag screens about setting up your payment method if you haven’t yet, but you can swipe right through those and get back to the jiggling butts.</p><p></p><p>A lot of the free material has tags like #uncensored, #NSFW and #boobs, but actual nudity seemed to be pretty damn rare. If you were hoping for a free fap to some hardcore porno, this ain’t the place. If you’re looking for a subscription site with better previews than OnlyFans, though, you’re on the right track.</p><p></p><p>Things did heat up when I started playing with search function. I decided to go hard right from jump, typing “Anal” into the box. That turned up some free clips of babes and their silicone friends, though the really naughty bits have been censored with flesh-colored Tetris pixels. The blowjob hashtag turned up slightly more explicit content, though the girls are sucking on dildos rather than real hogs.</p><p></p><p>There’s already a great range of content on Slushy, and the platform is still pretty new. I was able to find content for any keyword I searched for, from Feet to Femdom, BBW to BDSM, Cosplay to Creampies. Again, though, it seems like all the really dirty stuff is hidden behind the various paywalls. If you want to see uncensored content, it’s going to cost you.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Show Me to the Fully Naked Girls, Please</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Some models also have individual posts for sale. Again, the prices vary like crazy, but can include multiple pieces of media. I found a sexy Asian chick named Alice showing off her ass in black lingerie, and I could unlock the full set for thirty bones. It’s a steep price, the same rate I charge for a month at MissAVDHCasting, but it includes 3 pics and a video from the babe herself. I am a sophisticated man who likes to support the arts, so it may be time to add my payment method.</p><p></p><p>It ain’t all that relevant to what I do here at MissAVDH, which is largely masturbatory, but Slushy has a surprising number of social media features baked into the interface. I opened my profile to see my Liked videos and found places to enter info like my favorite sports teams and favorite songs, complete with Spotify integration. It seems like it might be overkill for a porn site, but I’m curious to see how it’s all used in the feature. If nothing else, you can find out who your favorite models are rooting for.</p><p></p><p>I’m not even bullshitting when I say Slushy.com is the best adult oriented TikTok knockoff I’ve tried so far. It’s not just the highly polished interface or the wide range of babes hawking their sexy wares, but the OnlyFans-style subscription model and related perks. They’ve managed to combine the best features of both platforms, resulting in something new, fapworthy, and more than a little addictive. It doesn’t cost anything to sign up, so I recommend setting up your own custom free feed to start with.</p>"}},{"id":"e647ccddb0d8","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"e647ccddb0d8","title":"MYM","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"MYM.fans is a social media content platform model can sell their amateur pictures and videos here.

The front page of MYM encourages visitors to “Be more than just a fan!” It’s honestly kind of a vague pitch, as they’re far from the only brand claiming a deeper connection with their customers than mere appreciation. I’m all for forging these bonds whenever and wherever possible, but let’s be real: you don’t earn brand loyalty through slogans. In this business, you do it by giving your visitors something really good to shake their dicks at.</p><p></p><p>Does MYM.fans deliver in this respect? That’s what I aimed to find out as I loaded up the front page and dug out my favorite jizz sock. <strong>They’re a social media platform where creators can hawk their content directly to their fans</strong>, drawing obvious comparisons to OnlyFans, the big king daddy of this modern amateur genre. The domain’s been around since 2018 and they’re pulling a hell of a lot more traffic than most OF competitors, with over 7 million visitors stopping by last month alone. Naturally, I was eager to see what they were all gawking at.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>This Sure Does Look Wholesome</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Honestly, if I didn’t know any better, I would have assumed the whole joint was fully wholesome and barely worth a MissAVDH’s time. MYM stands for Me, You, More, suggesting the type of intimacy you find on OnlyFans, but there’s no hint or real implication of sexiness anywhere on the tour. They tell you to start unique relationships, follow activity reserved for subscribers, and request personalized content, but that could apply to all sorts of material, SFW or otherwise.</p><p></p><p>I mainly aim these reviews at end-using masturbators, but I dug into MYM’s support page to see what kind of perks they were offering new creators. Models get the industry-standard 80% on most transactions, but only 75% on subscriptions. It seems like a small difference, but it just seems crazy to me to offer less than OnlyFans. The userbase here is much smaller, which means average payouts will be too, so a few extra percentage points might help lure more models onto the platform.</p><p></p><p><strong>Signup for MYM is quick, easy and free</strong>. You can go the classic route with your email address or do a one-click registration using your Facebook or Google credentials. I chose the latter option, agreed to their ToS and Privacy Policy, and was inside moments later.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Seriously, Where Are the Boobies?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Since I’m brand new and haven’t followed any creators yet, my default feed is full of French psychics, skiers showing off their mountain moves, interior decorating photos, meditation videos, poetry and memes. The only remotely sexy content doesn’t appeal to me, but might be of interest to the gay dudes in the audience: there’s a buff guy who likes to take shirtless photos with his food.</p><p></p><p>MYM doesn’t want people stealing their creators’ content, so they’ve watermarked all the images. I appreciate the effort and the protection it provides, but it was a little jarring to see my real name superimposed over a shirtless man’s ripped abs. I haven’t seen this style of watermarking before, but I know it’ll be a lot more effective at stamping out piracy than just stamping a MYM.fans logo on the pics.</p><p></p><p>Then again, I don’t think a lot of people are going to try stealing SFW selfies of a middle-aged psychic to share on their porn image sites—no shade intended. This isn’t the first social media content platform I’ve reviewed that seemed worksafe on the surface, but typically, I’d at least have seen a bikini shot by now. If there was any truly fapworthy content here, it was so well buried that I had my work cut out for me.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Digging Deep to Find…</h3><p></p><p></p><p>There’s no sidebar menu of recommended MYM.fans creators like you’ll find on OnlyFans and its ilk, and I’d already been disappointed by the suggestions in my starter feed. There are no menus of Tags, Categories, or Creators to flick through, nor an obvious free section collecting the previews.</p><p></p><p>The only potential way I saw of finding creators was the MYM.fans search function. I held my breath as I clicked through to the Search page, but I was pleasantly surprised to find a feed of the site’s newest posts beneath the search bar. It took a little more clicking to find the free previews from there, but <strong>there are some freebies to be seen</strong>.</p><p></p><p>The thing is, every last pic or video I saw was Safe For Work. Some of the fitness influencers on the platform have content you can definitely jack off to, but it ain’t half as scandalous or openly freaky as your average free tube. If you can browse Instagram at work without getting in trouble, you can browse MYM, too.</p><p></p><p>I do like that the search bar sifts through usernames, hashtags, locations and more. A lot of these platforms, OnlyFans included, only let you search through usernames. That ain’t all that useful except when models put your favorite tags in their handles, like SexyASMRBabe, AnalFootSlut, BDSMBlonde or FurryLesbianAsian.</p><p></p><p>You know what sucks, though? I had minimal luck typing my favorite keywords into the box. ASMR and Cosplay turned up one result each, but I got nothing for Lesbian, Anal, Blowjob or Swinger. I did find a few hashtag results for BDSM, Feet and Fetish, so perhaps this is just a waiting game. It’ll get easier as more models join the fray.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Settling In and Tickling Some Feet</h3><p></p><p></p><p>I found a foot model in New York offering monthly subscriptions on MYM.fans for about 6 euros a month. Creators can set their own prices and they do vary a bit, but most of the profiles I looked at had prices hovering around the 10-euro range. It’s about what you’d pay at OnlyFans.</p><p></p><p>In keeping with the OF-type theme, <strong>you can also hit up your favorite creators directly</strong>. You’ll have to subscribe first, but you expected that. This is a business, after all. The only question is whose DMs you’re going to slide into. I don’t know about you, but I’d be more excited if more of these chicks were hawking nudes instead of tarot readings.</p><p></p><p>MYM.fans ain’t my favorite OnlyFans imitator, if only because it feels so damn clean and wholesome. The basic infrastructure is familiar and functional but nothing special, not really building anything new or improved on top of the foundation set by OnlyFans. That’d be fine if they had a typical spread of nudie models and amateur pornstars, but it seems like the platform has largely attracted creators and influencers working in less erotic niches. I feel like the potential is there, but there’s just not enough T&amp;A to recommend this one to the average masturbator just yet.</p>"}},{"id":"bac40eb8589e","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"bac40eb8589e","title":"SextPanther","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"SextPanther.com is one of the best ways to date a dream beauty one-on-one find the most beautiful woman on the website and pay her a few dollars as time pays her she will text you on the website or contact you in other ways while you are free to...","canonical":"https://theporndude.com/zh/7937/sextpanther","affiliate_url":"https://www.sextpanther.com/?crid=102b559f9921653d6a213325bab4db&utm_medium=2045&src=&pyt=RS&utm_source=cr","rating":4,"siteOrder":14,"price":"free","tags":[],"features":[],"categories":[{"id":"premium-onlyfans-sites","collection":"categories_en"}],"screenshot_url":"https://cdn.staticstack.net/assets/img/r-thumbs/ebdf639-sextpanther_small.png","image_alt":"SextPanther, Premium OnlyFans Website","scraped_at":"2025-10-28T19:21:43.579Z","iconSpritesheet":"default","logoIconClass":"icon2115","pros":["tons of gorgeous babes","excellent business model","affordable payment options"],"cons":["nothing at all"],"detailedDescription":"<p>Sext Panther! Remember the days of telephone hotlines? I remember. I’m that old. For the uninitiated, phone sex hotlines used to exist back before we had the internet, and theoretically, they’re still there somewhere in your daily newspaper. Look for them towards the last pages of the paper, in a corner somewhere. These bitches currently make pennies on the dollar because the internet’s streamlined damn near everything to the point that phone sex is no longer a viable option to fap. It’s much easier just to watch a porn video and jerk off that way. You could do it on your phone or your computer. It doesn’t matter. It’s easier to fap online than it is over the phone.</p><p></p><p>But there are still people who crave the personal touch. That’s always been the point of phone sex, after all. You want to know that the person on the other side of the line is yours exclusively. You want to know that they’re listening to you and talking back to you - there’s a give and take that you can’t get from pornography. You want to engage in a two-way conversation with another human being to get your rocks off. Well, I won’t judge you. It’s a lonely world. These past few years especially have been hard on everyone. But I’m not looking to date this article. The point is, people are lonely, and they’re trying their best to find ways to connect with other people on the internet.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Chat Directly with the Babes</h3><p></p><p></p><p>First of all, you get to see extensive photography of the girl in question. Most of the time, you can even see her titties, and if you’re lucky, she might even flash her pussy for you long before you’ve signed up to talk to her. That’s the very first degree of extra steps taken to make this place super welcoming. Beyond that, there’s a delicate system in place that protects both you and the girl on the other side to make sure that everyone’s getting what they paid for. You need to join the website and deposit some credits to use any of the services on the site. But you don’t get charged a subscription or anything of the sort. It’s a much more streamlined system you have to contend with.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Pay Per Action</h3><p></p><p></p><p>All right so, <strong>she charges a dollar for every text message you send her; however, her replies are completely free</strong>. So, you can strike up a conversation with one message then receive several messages from her in response, for free. Then, you’re free to pay her money to send her a picture. You should probably save this functionality to send her dick pics because those are the best part of the fapping process, at least in my personal experience. So, you send her a dick pic for $3.50, and she sends you a naughty pic back. Of course, you don’t get a guarantee about what she’s going to send you, but I hope it’s going to be spicy.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Crank it Up a Notch</h3><p></p><p></p><p>You could probably hire this girl for three minutes, have her flash her asshole at you and get the fuck out of there before she knows what happened. It’s a great deal if you ask me. Alternatively, you could get a customized video for the aforementioned $10 and use it to fap over and over again since the video is yours to keep.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>So Many Perfect Women</h3><p></p><p></p><p>That’s what this website is all about. You get a nice spread of hundreds of babes, all of whom are currently online. If you’re looking at the list of babes that are offline, that number rises tenfold. There are countless women on this site, and they’re all here waiting for you to drop them a line. Plus, if you’ve got some sort of weird fetishes, like if you’re into fat chicks or you want your babes a bit on the older side, they’ve more than got you covered. There are tons of MILFs, fatties, uglies, oldies, and all kinds of bitches on the site. Though, the majority of chicks on the site are young, fuckable blondes. I’m sorry, that’s just the most popular type of woman right now. You can’t blame SextPanther for the selection process.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>All the Different Flavors</h3><p></p><p></p><p>There are also so many genre-specific bitches that are ready to do all kinds of things for you, provided you’re willing to pay. There are dominatrix babes, submissive chicks, even findom mommies if you’re into that kind of kink. Hell, there are even tons of professional pornstars who quit porn so they could do this kind of video sexting live, full time. The possibilities are endless on SextPanther because the babes just keep coming. There are new additions at all times. They won’t stop signing up.</p><p></p><p>I think SextPanther has a bright future ahead, considering how affordable the girls are and how accessible the smut is. You get direct access to a babe who’s only there for your enjoyment. There’s a direct connection. Plus, you get to preview all the goodies long before you submit any kind of payment. Hell, you can check out all the chicks before you’ve even signed up for the free profile. That’s how you know that this site is legit and loaded with quality. I can’t recommend it enough. Check it out, browse through the bitches, and you will see firsthand that this is a place of quality.</p>"}},{"id":"40d573321e13","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"40d573321e13","title":"DailyDoseOfLeaks","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"DailyDoseOfLeaks.com is a free collection of high-quality amateur content including nude photo gallery and slutty XXX small movie cheap membership","canonical":"https://theporndude.com/zh/19633/dailydoseofleaks","affiliate_url":"https://pdude.link/dailydoseofleaks","rating":4,"siteOrder":15,"price":"premium","tags":["免费"],"features":[],"categories":[{"id":"premium-onlyfans-sites","collection":"categories_en"}],"screenshot_url":"https://cdn.staticstack.net/assets/img/r-thumbs/c5db14a-dailydoseofleaks_small.png","image_alt":"DailyDoseOfLeaks, Premium OnlyFans Website","scraped_at":"2025-10-28T19:21:50.297Z","iconSpritesheet":"custom-favicon-spritesheet.png","iconPosition":"-256px -880px","iconClassName":"ctm-icon19633","logoIconClass":"icon19633","pros":["freemium collection of onlyfans-style amateur content","most content is accessible for free","gorgeous amateur models","around 160 posts so far, each packed with pics and vids","cheap memberships","downloads available","a great variety of homebrew sex vids and nudes"],"cons":["mandatory ads for free users","unclear how often they’re updating","no tagging"],"detailedDescription":"<p>Have you had your Daily Dose of Leaks? If I were your doctor, I might be inquiring about your health and hydration, but this is your old pal MissAVDH talking. Given the context, I think you can guess exactly what kind of leaks we’ll be gawking at today. These ain’t a job for your plumber, but you’ll probably be doing some pumping of your own, at least if you’re into beautiful naked girls.</p><p></p><p><strong>DailyDoseOfLeaks.com is a freemium collection of OnlyFans-style amateur content</strong>. I swear, we’re living in the golden age of DIY smut, and there’s so much amazing content coming out of the social networks and content platforms. These guys are promising “The Best Exclusive Sluts”, and I just had to find out who they were talking about. Who knows? Maybe I’d even find some of my sexy friends in there. Let’s take a look!</p><p></p><p></p><h3>It's Time for Your Daily Dose</h3><p></p><p></p><p><strong>There are gorgeous amateur nudie models everywhere I look</strong>. There are blondes and brunettes, redheads and raven-haired goth chicks. You’ll find fitness babes, exotic princesses and girls next door, all showing off the goods. The selection skews young; I’d guess most of these babes are between 18 and their early 20s, without a lot of MILFs to be seen. There are Asians, Latinas, mixed gals, and a whole lot of sexy white broads.</p><p></p><p>DailyDoseOfLeaks.com calls these chicks the best exclusive sluts, and I think it’s more than just the generic brag you find pretty much everywhere else. I consider myself a pretty enthusiastic pornography connoisseur, and I know a lot of video whores, both personally and from my masturbatory sessions. Flipping through the spread, I didn’t immediately recognize anyone. It was all fresh, beatific faces attached to matching bodies.</p><p></p><p>As of this writing, there are around 160 posts packed with sexy selfies, mirror nudes, masturbation pics, sex videos and more. I couldn’t find any upload dates listed anywhere on Daily Dose of Leaks, so I’m afraid I can’t tell you how quickly they’re adding new material to the stash. For a new site, though, this is a great and promising start. I’d love it if they really were dropping a Daily Dose of Leaks.</p><p></p><p>I called DailyDoseOfLeaks a “freemium” site in my intro because of the VIP plan I’ll be looking at in a minute here, but it’s definitely worth mentioning that <strong>most of the content is accessible for free</strong>. The catch comes in form of ads, but not the usual pop-ups and banner ads you get elsewhere. To unlock a recent post featuring this thick-thighed beauty named Tayler, they opened a new tab and made me watch 40 seconds of a YouTube ad first. The gallery and vids that appeared after the video were totally worth it.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Cheap Memberships, No Spam and Additional Content</h3><p></p><p></p><p>A spam-free experience ain’t the only thing you get with the membership. About a quarter of the posts are labeled VIP Only, and yeah, it works just like you’d expect it to. I do wish they made it a little easier to see just the VIP content, though. The “VIP Area” is just a page telling me to login to access the exclusive VIP library, along with my username, showing that I was already logged in.</p><p></p><p><strong>Memberships are cheap</strong>. You can get full access to DailyDoseOfLeaks for 10 euros, which is about a third of what you’d pay for a typical porno paysite like my own MissAVDHCasting. The three-month plan doesn’t offer much of a discount, but they do have a lifetime membership available for €99.99 if you never want to lose your access to these lovely naked ladies.</p><p></p><p>Speaking as a guy who literally just made the switch from free to premium, it really does make for a much smoother masturbatory session. Now that I’m VIP, I feel like I was previously browsing the site in slow motion. Free users can’t even see the full spread of thumbnails until they watch an ad for each post, so now it’s even easier to find the best stuff.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>I Prescribe You a Maximum-Strength Dose</h3><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Every post at Daily Dose of Leaks contains dozens of pieces of content, including both pictures and videos</strong>. Jasmijn’s gallery of stills is mouthwatering, full of selfies, bikini shots, titty flashes and full-on nudes. She’s only got three videos on the site, fewer than a lot of the other models, but the vibrator scene is a perfect example of modern amateur porn. There’s been a real renaissance in solo work ever since the start of the pandemic, and I’m glad to see the trend continues.</p><p></p><p><strong>You can download whatever you want</strong>, too. There’s no Download button, so just right-click on any of the videos to save it to your hard drive. I kind of wish they had a one-click Download button for saving the galleries as zip files or something, but the collectors can always use a third-party image downloader plugin to get the job done. No biggie.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Fapworthy Nudes and Hardcore Amateur Porn</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Case in point, another recent VIP Only post featuring a babe named Valerie. Her gallery is like Instagram without the prudish community guidelines, with a whole lot of exposed T&amp;A. I love the bedroom nudes, including one where her ass has a fresh coat of frosty sperm, but her videos are truly something to behold.</p><p></p><p>There are a lot of vids in the library where chicks are just showing off their bodies without any props or penetration, but Valerie’s got multiple scenes with dildos, and a close-up of a manicured finger dipping inside. My favorite Valerie video, though, is the one where she’s eagerly slobbing on some dude’s knob. If it were a regular porno, I’d assume she was sucking off a regular random porn stud. In this genre, that’s probably her real man.</p><p></p><p>The impressive range of material does, however, draw attention to one little flaw in the whole DailyDoseOfLeaks presentation: there’s no tagging, which means you can’t really search or browse for anything in particular. There’s a search bar, but it’s only good for model names. I tried typing a few of my favorite keywords (cosplay, blowjob and feet), but got zero results for every query. The site’s still new, though, so hopefully they integrate tags at some point. As the library grows, it’s only going to get harder to peruse without tags.</p><p></p><p>DailyDoseOfLeaks.com is worth a look if you’re into modern amateur porn and you’re looking for a free or cheap new source of goodies. One of my favorite things about my visit was just how many new faces I saw, and every one of them was consistently beautiful, with her own stash of fapworthy pics and videos. You can see most of the material here without signing up or going premium, but for a few bucks a month, you get a little more and a smoother experience. I’d check out the freebies first and go from there.</p>"}},{"id":"40670a1a97d3","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"40670a1a97d3","title":"MyClub","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"My.Club is a brand new social media porn platform created by the creators of StripChat here is a variety of amateur beauty models and a powerful search engine","canonical":"https://theporndude.com/zh/13053/myclub","affiliate_url":"https://go.xlvirdr.com/mc?path=%2Fposts&userId=c637fd2a4a50870636df00bfc878c986","rating":5,"siteOrder":16,"price":"free","tags":[],"features":[],"categories":[{"id":"tiktok-porn-sites","collection":"categories_en"},{"id":"premium-onlyfans-sites","collection":"categories_en"}],"screenshot_url":"https://cdn.staticstack.net/assets/img/r-thumbs/8ab157a-myclub_small.png","image_alt":"MyClub, Tik Tok porn website","scraped_at":"2025-10-28T16:40:56.623Z","iconSpritesheet":"default","logoIconClass":"icon2085","pros":["social media porn platform a la onlyfans","tons of free content","a beautiful range of models and amateur pornstars","a great variety of adult content","much easier to search than onlyfans","slide into those dms"],"cons":["mostly solo content, minimal hardcore"],"detailedDescription":"<p>If I asked you to join My Club, would you do it? That’s something of a trick question, obviously, since you’re already reading my website and may have seen my work at MissAVDHCasting, too. I’ve already established my own little corner of the web, which is growing bigger by the day, but what about all the adult content creators out there who don’t want to learn web design, marketing, and all that other nerdy bullshit? They’ve got a growing number of options for peddling their smut, and this next one looks promising as hell. (Although if you’re looking for an edge, I’ve got a lot of tips on my other site, PornWebmasters!)</p><p></p><p>My.Club calls itself “The #1 subscription-based platform with real creators.” That’s a big brag, especially with OnlyFans pulling more than a quarter of a billion visits monthly, but this ain’t some new company popping up out of nowhere. <strong>This one’s a social media porn platform by the same folks who do StripChat, so I immediately had higher hopes than I do with most OnlyFans knockoffs</strong>. Their webcam platform has consistently held a top slot on my list of Live Sex Cam Sites here at MissAVDH, so I couldn’t wait to see how well they pull this off. Could the big OF finally have a real competitor?</p><p></p><p></p><h3>My Club, Your Club, Everybody’s Club</h3><p></p><p></p><p>My.Club, on the other hand, makes it very clear what you’re signing up for. The front page is covered in thumbnails showing nylon-clad legs and red heels, pretty girls in lingerie, and ripe, succulent peaches aimed right at the camera. They also list the basic perks of the platform instead of expecting you to have heard about it elsewhere. The whole thing’s wrapped up in a polished presentation that makes OnlyFans feel a little half-assed.</p><p></p><p>I know most of my readers here are going to be visiting the site as fans, not creators, but it’s worth taking a quick look at the terms here. My.Club takes the same 20% cut as OnlyFans, which seems pretty standard at this point. OF is big enough to set expectations we see all over the adult internet, from paysites ditching downloads to the payouts I’m talking about here. I keep expecting a platform to lure creators by offering a better percentage, but so far, I haven’t seen it happen.</p><p></p><p>Unlike OnlyFans or any of the off-brand clones I’ve reviewed, My Club will let you start poking around their growing catalog before you even sign up. One of my biggest longstanding beefs with OF is the general lack of freebies, but that ain’t the case here. Clicking through to the Discover area, <strong>I found a wealth of free adult content to get you in the mood to spend money</strong>. From nudie photo shoots to twerk videos to fetish photos, there’s plenty for a cheapskate to shake his dick at around here.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>What If OnlyFans Had a Useful Search Function?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>There is, however, an unobtrusive row of content at the top of the page, sortable by Top, Trending or New. The current spread includes foot fetish models, thick-assed Latinas, ebony dominatrixes, cosplay cuties, goth girls, Asian nymphettes and sexy chubby chicks. In other words, they’ve got <strong>a nice range of models and homemade pornstars hawking their wares</strong>. As with OnlyFans, the demographics do skew a little younger than the amateur tubes. This is the social media generation, after all.</p><p></p><p>My absolute biggest complaint about OnlyFans is that it’s damn near impossible to search. They make it so difficult for fans and creators to find each other, basically expecting all promotion to take place on other platforms. It’s crazy from a business perspective, and frustrating from a masturbatory angle. My.Club’s recommendations already make discovery easier, and it gets better.</p><p></p><p><strong>The search function works so much better than the bullshit at OnlyFans</strong>. The search bar actually says “Search creators,” so I was worried it’d be the same largely useless setup, but it helps find tags, too. I was quickly able to find category selections for Blondes, Masturbation, Anal, Femdom, BDSM and Feet. My dudes, I can’t tell you how happy it makes me to find a social media porn platform that makes it this easy to find your preferred fap fodder.</p><p></p><p>Oh, and in case you missed the obvious subtext in that last paragraph, I’ll spell it out in bold letters: <strong>creators are posting a fantastic variety of adult content in this Club</strong>. The content does lean heavily toward solo shows and photosets, which is to be expected from the genre. Most of these models are working with webcams and iPhones, often from the comfort of their own bedrooms. Hey, ladies, if you ever need a stunt cock for your videos, hit me up!</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Stock Your Feed and Slide Into Those DMs</h3><p></p><p></p><p>It's ultimately a premium platform, though. Between the photos in my feed of bare feet, big butts and pretty girls in bikinis, there were a lot of blurred-out thumbnails. “Join Club to Unlock,” reads the text. Some posts are unlockable for a few bucks as one-offs, but usually you’ve got to subscribe to a particular creator.</p><p></p><p>Models on the platform set their own prices. As you can probably imagine, those prices are all over the place. Some babes only want a few bones for the privilege of seeing them naked, while others are asking twenty bucks or more. You can usually score a discount on longer subscriptions. Considering how fast these packages can add up, I’ll take any deal I can get.</p><p></p><p>Joining a club on My Club gives you access to a creator’s content and their stories, unblurring those cockblocked pics and vids from your feed. <strong>It also lets you chat with your favorite content creators</strong>. This is one of the biggest selling points of OnlyFans or any of its imitators, as you just can’t get that level of intimacy on your average porn site. Leave a comment at MissAVDHCasting and the models might see it, but here, you can slide directly into their DMs.</p><p></p><p>I’m not bullshitting when I say My.Club is the most promising OnlyFans competitor I’ve seen yet. The layout is gorgeous and the growing selection of models even more so, but I think it’s the interface that really takes this one to the next level. They may well have the best search engine of any social media porn site, which ensures those lovely ladies will have all the eyes on them they deserve instead of languishing in obscurity. As the platform continues to grow and attract more models, it’s only going to get better and better. This one has some of the best freebies, too, so it couldn’t help to sign up and start poking around.</p>"}},{"id":"b4c231186879","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"b4c231186879","title":"4Based","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"4Based.com is another option for OnlyFans here models can interact directly with their fans and sell a wide range of beauties with lots of free sexy content","canonical":"https://theporndude.com/zh/11803/4based","affiliate_url":"https://4based.com/login?ext_id=gc1984","rating":4,"siteOrder":16,"price":"free","tags":["免费"],"features":[],"categories":[{"id":"premium-onlyfans-sites","collection":"categories_en"}],"screenshot_url":"https://cdn.staticstack.net/assets/img/r-thumbs/58f0b0c-4based_small.png","image_alt":"4Based, Premium OnlyFans Website","scraped_at":"2025-10-28T19:21:58.280Z","iconSpritesheet":"default","logoIconClass":"icon2075","pros":["diy content platform and social network","revenue sharing for creators","a nice range of homebrew pornstars and models","lots of free content","easier to browse than onlyfans","reels – free short videos","subscriptions or individual content purchases"],"cons":["minimal search options","all the sexiest stuff costs money"],"detailedDescription":"<p>4based has a tagline out on their front page that says the site is, “For creators. For Fans. For you.” It seems like an intentionally vague statement, the kind of thing that could be applied to pretty much any social media network, content platform, or really any site where people are sharing anything. Obviously, I wouldn’t be writing up the joint here at MissAVDH if I didn’t think it had some masturbatory potential, and well, I’ve heard good things.</p><p></p><p>I first heard of 4based.com in a conversation about alternatives to OnlyFans. The site’s been around a couple years now and has largely gone unnoticed in the shadow of the big OF, but they do get close to a million visitors every month. <strong>The site gives homebrew pornstars a place to sell their content directly to fans</strong>, which should sound awfully familiar if you’ve been shaking your dick at the internet over the last couple years. Let’s see how they actually measure up to the platform that everybody already knows about.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Getting Based with 4based</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Load up OnlyFans or 4based for the first time and you’d never guess they were peddling smut in there. The front page of 4Based looks polished and professional, but it’s light as hell on content. Besides some login and signup options, the only other thing on the screen is a simulated phone flipping through a familiar-looking social media interface. Instead of naked girls and blowjobs, though, it’s all food photos, memes and pretty wholesome selfies.</p><p></p><p>As a porn reviewer here at MissAVDH, a dick-slanging stud at MissAVDHCasting, and a knowledge-dropping expert at PornWebmasters, I’m not sure I’ll ever understand the reasoning for a SFW landing page on a site that sells masturbatory content. Most bait-and-switch scams lure you in with something good only to offer something shitty, but this is the exact opposite approach. Are they shooting themselves in the dick?</p><p></p><p>Whatever the case, I needed to see more, and that meant signing up. Registration is free, fast and simple, and you can even use your Google or Twitter credentials to get inside with just a click or two. I took a few seconds to fill in a username, email address and password, and the confirmation hit my inbox almost instantly.</p><p></p><p>I know most of my visitors here are porn consumers, not creators, so I’m mainly going to be aiming this review at the wankers and spankers. That said, it’s worth checking out the Earning Conditions on 4based.com if you’re an amateur pornographer yourself. They’re not offering the standard 80% cut of earnings that OnlyFans has managed to make standard on these platforms, but they might make up for it. Maybe.</p><p></p><p>4based creators only get 70% of their revenues from sales, chats, subscriptions, tips and everything else. That seems like it’d only drive creators to other platforms, but they do offer some revenue sharing that could potentially make up for the smaller percentage. Creators also get 10% of whatever their own customers are spending on other creators. They also get a 5% cut of the earnings from creators who signed up through their 4based link. If you’re big into networking, this could translate into big profits.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Let’s Take a Look at Those Ladies</h3><p></p><p></p><p>I clicked the Explore 4based button and the site’s true vibe was finally revealed. The front page implied there’d be at least some wholesome, boring content, but all I saw was pretty girls in various states of undress. I thought there were going to be kittens and recipes, too!</p><p></p><p><strong>There’s a nice range of babes signing up to sell their nudes and vids on 4based</strong>. They’re drawing much of the same Instagram demographic as OnlyFans, so the models skew younger (18+), but I did see some MILFs among the mix. There are white girls aplenty, plus some ebony chicks, Asians, Latinas and mixed exotic chicks. I found thick babes, tattooed emo chicks, cosplay girls and a domina rocking some leather pants.</p><p></p><p>It looks like full nudes ain’t allowed in the thumbnails covering the search page, because every topless shot is cleverly angled to hide the nipples. Girls without panties cover the goods with coffee cups and video game controllers, though I did spot a couple bare asses.</p><p></p><p>I started clicking on the prettiest chicks, then hitting the Follow button to fill out my 4based.com feed. There’s a ton of free amateur content here, and I bet a bunch of you cheapskates are just going to rub loads out to these babes with no intention of ever signing up. Good luck, though, because I’m only a few minutes into it and I know my wallet’s going to be hurting soon. These freebies are enticing!</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Seeing the Sexy Sites at 4based</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Right now, there are only a few ways to sift through the pile. For starters, you can scroll through the extensive range of babes on the Explore page, or type something into the search bar. The problem with the search bar is that it only seems to scan through usernames. Searches for BBW, BDSM, Feet and Femdom only turned up models with those terms in their handles. That’s going to make it a lot harder to find niche-specific content.</p><p></p><p>They’ve also got a Reels section, which 4based says is still in beta. It’s another familiar feature, modeled after services like Instagram or TikTok. You can watch free, short, vertical clips of models looking sexy as fuck. I ended up following a few more creators after seeing them wiggle their pedicured toes or shake their asses.</p><p></p><p>Once I’d populated my feed with gamer girls (18+), sultry MILFs and big-assed tattoo sluts, it was time to get fapping. One thing you’ll probably figure out right away is that the sexiest, most explicit content is typically hidden until you pay for it. Scrolling through my feed, I had a lot of sexy selfies interspersed with blurry, price-tagged thumbnails.</p><p></p><p>Users have the option of subscriptions or individual content purchases. A German emo girl I’d followed had a locked post labeled “Boobies” available for three bucks. Alternately, I could sign up for her premium subscription for $60, which would unlock all her paid public posts and let me chat with the gal.</p><p></p><p>4based.com lets creators set their own prices and terms, so some skip the subscriptions and only offer a la carte clips. Others do a little of this and a little of that, offering subscriptions but selling other posts as doubly premium content. Prices are all over the place, but you may want to set a budget if you don’t want to burn through your allowance too quickly.</p><p></p><p>I’m a little bit late to the 4based party, but I really like what I found inside. While they ain’t half as popular as OnlyFans, they’ve built a nice interface for both the models and their horny fans. It’s easy to browse, offers a wide range of amateur content, and features freebies galore. I’d say this one’s worth signing up for even if you ain’t planning on spending any money, but don’t blame me if you ultimately can’t resist the urge to start buying clips and subscriptions.</p>"}},{"id":"13412605bb4e","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"13412605bb4e","title":"SoSpoilt","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"SoSpoilt.com is a content platform that combines web video shows and phone sex chats to subscribe to your favorite models or follow them to get photos and videos for free","canonical":"https://theporndude.com/zh/13329/sospoilt","affiliate_url":"https://sospoilt.com/popular/all?aff=MissAVDH","rating":4,"siteOrder":17,"price":"free","tags":["免费"],"features":["聊天"],"categories":[{"id":"premium-onlyfans-sites","collection":"categories_en"}],"screenshot_url":"https://cdn.staticstack.net/assets/img/r-thumbs/34b3456-sospoilt_small.png","image_alt":"SoSpoilt, Premium OnlyFans Website","scraped_at":"2025-10-28T19:22:12.590Z","iconSpritesheet":"default","logoIconClass":"icon1981","pros":["onlyfans-style adult content platform","free $10 welcome bonus","better payouts than onlyfans","a nice range of models","lots of free content"],"cons":["poor navigation (almost impossible to find the adult content)","free content is pretty soft"],"detailedDescription":"<p>Some women are just So Spoilt, but I have to admit, I’m sometimes one of the dudes spoiling the hell out of them. Now, I ain’t talking about being a sugar daddy or even going on expensive dates, but I’ve reviewed websites with those aims here at MissAVDH if that’s what you’re looking for. Today, though, I’m talking about spoiling beautiful women by tossing money into the hat when they get naked on the internet. Do you see what I’m getting at here?</p><p></p><p><strong>SoSpoilt.com is an adult content platform similar to OnlyFans, with tightly integrated webcam shows and phone sex</strong>. I’ve actually written up separate reviews for their phone stuff and cam shows, so be sure to check those out if you’re hoping for some one-on-one time with any of these babes. In this review, I’m going to focus on the more traditional offerings you expect from an OnlyFans clone, like the nudie pics and subscriptions. While they ain’t as popular as the big OF, the site gets well over a quarter million visits a month. Let’s see what everyone’s gawking at, shall we?</p><p></p><p></p><h3>SoSpoilt vs OnlyFans: First Impressions</h3><p></p><p></p><p>This review is going to be aimed mainly at SoSpoilt fans, those of you who will just be shaking your dicks at your screen, but it’s worth mentioning at least one of the creator perks here. <strong>SoSpoilt takes a smaller cut than OnlyFans</strong>, offering creators up to 90% instead of the usual 80%. Most platforms let OnlyFans set the standards, but I hope the bigger payouts here will lure more amateur pornstars over this way.</p><p></p><p>I got a little excited when I saw there’s a SoSpoilt app available, but it’s currently only for creators. It’s a legit app, too, available for iPhone and Android. This did give me a little bit of pause, though; if porn apps are banned on the official Apple and Google app stores, does this mean SoSpoilt would be less naughty than their competitors?</p><p></p><p>As with OnlyFans, there’s very little to be seen at So Spoilt without signing up for an account. Fortunately, it’s free and fast to sign up. You can use your Twitter, Google or Apple credentials for simplicity’s sake, or go old-school by giving them an email address. I used Google, and I was looking at my new custom feed just seconds later.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>But Where Are the Boobies?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>My biggest longstanding complaint about OnlyFans is that it’s still basically impossible to search or browse for what you’re into unless you already know the names of some models making the stuff. I feel like most of the knockoff platforms do a better job letting users dig into the pile, but So Spoilt isn’t much better than OnlyFans in this respect. The search bar at the top of the screen only rifles through usernames, no kinks, sex acts or genres. I couldn’t find a genre menu either, which is always on my wish list for these joints.</p><p></p><p>Overall, the navigation kind of sucks. I couldn’t find a way to click from the member’s Home feed to the list of popular creators. None of the Suggested Creators in the sidebar are hawking smut, and the only other list of creators I could pull up easily were the ones available for live chat or calls. The problem persisted even after I verified my age by entering a MasterCard number. (They won’t accept debit for age verification.)</p><p></p><p>Speaking as the guy who runs MissAVDH, MissAVDHCasting, PornWebmasters and other successful adult sites, I’m a little bit shocked by how hard it is to get from point A to point B at SoSpoilt. There are going to be a lot of disappointed horny dudes who sign up and immediately leave because they can’t find the page of Popular Creators. Since they don’t make it easy, perhaps not even possible, you’re going to need this URL: sospoilt.com/popular/all</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Oh, There They Are!</h3><p></p><p></p><p>There’s a fair amount of free content to get your blood pumping, though it’s not as explicit as you might find on your average paysite. So Spoilt models can include free content in their otherwise paid profiles, eliminating the need for separate free and premium pages like they do on OnlyFans. A lingerie-clad, curvy camgirl named RaeRae offers monthly subscriptions at just under eight bucks a month, but I was getting excited over her free pics and vids even before I subscribed.</p><p></p><p>Models can set their own subscription prices, so they’re all over the place. Some chicks only charge a few bucks, while most prices seem to hover around the $10 range. Since the So Spoilt platform has such tightly integrated webcam shows and phone sex, some of the models offer discounted rates on these interactions for their subscribers.</p><p></p><p>If you don’t have enough money this month for the subscriptions you want, no worries, because you can just Follow your favorites in the meantime. That’ll stock your Home feed with all the free stuff these women are posting, and also let you know when they post their more explicit premium content. I know some of you cheapskates are just going to get off to the freebies, but either way, it’s good to stay in the loop!</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Stocking My Feed, Stroking My Dick</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Some even include lists of services in their free posts. Yesterday, a babe named Roxy posted about how she’s a squirter and loves anal play, but you’ve got to subscribe or catch a cam show to see it. Overall, the free content tends to be pretty softcore, a teaser for the more explicit, more expensive stuff. That said, I did see some nips and a whole lot of ass in my feed even before I’d subscribed to anything premium on the site.</p><p></p><p>I’m honestly not sure what SoSpoilt is trying to do here. The front page is clean as hell, but the site title and the setup suggest a hive of amateur models a la OnlyFans. Then, once you get inside, it still looks clean as hell unless you’ve got the link to the Popular Creators page (sospoilt.com/popular/all). It seems like a perfectly good way to lose customers and ultimately lose money. Why build a platform for models to sell sexy content and then hide all the good stuff behind tarot card readers and fashion influencers? I don’t want to spoil them!</p><p></p><p>SoSpoilt.com is a promising site with some great features for both amateur models and their fans, including those integrated cam shows and phone sex calls. My one big hope for the joint is just that they make it easier to find the adult content you’re looking for without having to consult a review like this one. Until then, well, you can always come back here and I’ll point you in the right direction.</p>"}},{"id":"c3c3957b3a4d","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"c3c3957b3a4d","title":"Uplust","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"Uplust.com is the first social network without censorship mechanism to offer sexy, obscene and pornographic amateur content than Snapchat or Instagram Watch beautiful girl next door giving boyfriend blowjob and playing lesbian games with her friends to you the most...","canonical":"https://theporndude.com/zh/4650/uplust","affiliate_url":"https://uplust.com?ref=geoffreycelen2","rating":4,"siteOrder":18,"price":"free","tags":[],"features":["游戏"],"categories":[{"id":"premium-onlyfans-sites","collection":"categories_en"}],"screenshot_url":"https://cdn.staticstack.net/assets/img/r-thumbs/3d0cebe-uplust_small.png","image_alt":"Uplust, Premium OnlyFans Website","scraped_at":"2025-10-28T19:22:24.178Z","iconSpritesheet":"custom-favicon-spritesheet.png","iconPosition":"-240px -416px","iconClassName":"ctm-icon4650","logoIconClass":"icon4650","pros":["active, uncensored adult social network","tons of amateur pictures and videos","multiple membership tiers","lots of free diy smut available"],"cons":["some content/features locked to paying members only"],"detailedDescription":"<p>I hope you won’t judge me for saying this, but I spent all morning jacking off to Snapchat videos. I love how these social media broads act sexy for the camera just to gain a few followers, dressing provocatively as they ramble about bullshit and show us their Starbucks. Then it occurred to me that Snapchat, Instagram, or any of those platforms would be a hell of a lot better with a hell of a lot more porn. A few minutes later, somebody sent me a link to Uplust.</p><p></p><p>Uplust claims to be The First Uncensored Social Network, online since 2013. Censorship is a funny thing on social media, where the rules fluctuate depending on what’s PC at the moment, so I’m really kind of curious what they mean by that. The site gets about a quarter of a million visits every month, so hopefully, it means a ton of free amateur porno. I guess there’s only one way to find out.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Social Media for Dirty Perverts</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Most adult websites these days will give you a taste without making you sign up, but this ain’t one of them. You’ll have to pick a username and password, plus provide them with an email address. Don’t be a dip shit and use the same one you share with your wife.</p><p></p><p>They send you a verification email instantly, then you upload a photo and answer a few simple questions about who you are and what you’re looking for. I am a Guy who likes Girls — you know the drill.</p><p></p><p>Uplust really prides itself on having a ton of verified members. This is good news, because it prevents spammy accounts and phishing attempts from catfishers who just uploaded some amateur shots they found on 4Chan. The bad news is that it makes full verification a little bit slower.</p><p></p><p>Users can upload an upper-body shot with a piece of paper showing your username and the date, or you can just upgrade to a paid account immediately to unlock all the features. If you go the free route, you have to wait for your confirmation photo to be manually verified.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Amateur Porn – Even for Free Users</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Uplust is a social media site, so your initially blank timeline will show a sidebar of popular users you can follow. As I look at it right now, there is a brunette flashing her muff in her profile picture. Then, we also have two chicks with their asses right up against the camera, and a couple who have chosen to represent themselves with their luscious, beautiful breasts.</p><p></p><p>I, unfortunately, can’t subscribe to any of them yet with this half-verification, but at least I can look at their profiles. I clicked on the girl aiming her phone at her twat, who’s got 80,000 followers already.</p><p></p><p>The Spanish beauty has posted on Uplust nearly 2000 times so far, with 40 videos of amateur smut for fans to jerk off to. The babe posts new material every day, usually showing off her tits and occasionally her cunt. She doesn’t seem to want to show her face, which is typically cropped off the top of the photo.</p><p></p><p>I clicked the Videos tab to see her amateur movies. There’s a 30-second blowjob clip added five months ago, with the thirsty girl slurping on a gentlemen’s veiny member. A few months before that, she went a little bit lighter with a WebCam clip of what some might describe as a home breast exam. She’s also got DIY clips of some dude eating her pussy and another where she’s getting slammed doggystyle.</p><p></p><p>At the bottom of both her Photo and Video page is a message saying I can unlock her dozens of clips and thousands of pics if I subscribe to a membership. I was pretty happy about all the free homemade smut, but there’s always a catch, right? They’ve got to make their money somehow, I guess, so let’s see what kind of change they’re asking for.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Different Memberships for Different Budgets</h3><p></p><p></p><p>If you just want to get in for a month, it will cost you about five bucks, 10 bucks, or 20, depending on which tier of membership you want. As you may have guessed, the Basic membership gives you primary access to use the site. Premium adds the ability to get featured, used the advanced search, block users, and get rid of ads. You big ballers get some extra perks like unlimited followings, statistics, and notifications histories.</p><p></p><p>Premium and VIP members can also cash out of their Lusts. These are the website’s virtual currency, which can be used to buy premium content, such as exclusive photos and videos. You can also send some Lust as a gift to your favorite user, a great way to ask for a private show. There are also bonus features to unlock in the Shop section, like filters and advanced editing options. Lusts start at 10 bucks for a hundred, or you can get a bonus by buying a bunch at once.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Constant Updates of Fresh DIY Porn</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Even with my account verification still pending, I was able to peruse the Top-Rated content on the website. That Spanish babe I was checking out earlier made the cut with a topless photo, as did a hot young 18+ Latina in a thong with her ass up in the air. A lithe redhead poses in the buff, and a brunette flashes her titties and a smile.</p><p></p><p>I clicked the Videos tab to see the Top-Rated clips of the day, though weekly, monthly, and yearly views are also available. I like how even though I haven’t subscribed to the website or followed any of the users, I already have a constant stream of fresh material to beat off to.</p><p></p><p>Today’s top clips on Uplust include a babe slipping off her underwear to show off her booty and a babe with a camera right up against her wet cunt as she fingers the thing. It makes a lot of loud, slurping noises, and I can’t help noticing the wedding ring on her finger.</p><p></p><p>Don’t forget, Uplust is a social network, with all that entails. The wet pussy video already has a bunch of comments from dudes asking if they can fuck her, just like the comments under any video on any free tube. Most of them have boners for profile pictures, but I doubt any of them are going to bone her.</p><p></p><p>While the site may technically be a social network, it has more in common with WebCam porn sites than Facebook or even Instagram. By that, I mean the relationships are going to be pretty one-sided. You can chat up a broad and pay her to show you her titties, but I doubt very many people are actually making friends here. The ones who do are probably doing more than just leaving comments like, “I’m ready to lick your pussy juice.”</p><p></p><p>Uplust.com is an amateur porn site with a twist, styling itself like a pornographic version of Snapchat or Instagram. As with the social media giants, there’s plenty of free material to shake your dick at here, though paying members have easier access to the blowjob and basement fuck movies. Users are invited to interact with their favorite exhibitionists here and contribute their own content, resulting in a thriving community of DIY perversion for the social media set.</p>"}},{"id":"af8e3ae915e1","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"af8e3ae915e1","title":"Banned Stories","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"BannedStories.com has the erotic social media stories you've always hoped to find on Instagram and Snapchat peeking at beautiful actresses like Gianna Dior and Alex Coal while...","canonical":"https://theporndude.com/zh/4663/bannedstories","affiliate_url":"https://bannedstories.com?clickid=107859_40282_%3Dutm_source%3D107859&utm_campaign=&xk=c0b16010e1eedbb3697d656a1761ceba&bn=38&gu=https%3A%2F%2Fgo.moaroffers.com%2Fgo.php%3Ft%3D40282%26aid%3D107859%26sid%3D%26hts_id%3Dec59d3ea-80f1-49ad-bb81-6c70a0e04daa&i18n_country=JP&hts_id=ec59d3ea-80f1-49ad-bb81-6c70a0e04daa","rating":4,"siteOrder":19,"price":"free","tags":[],"features":[],"categories":[{"id":"premium-onlyfans-sites","collection":"categories_en"}],"screenshot_url":"https://cdn.staticstack.net/assets/img/r-thumbs/58155b4-bannedstories_small.png","image_alt":"Banned Stories, Premium OnlyFans Website","scraped_at":"2025-10-28T19:22:33.501Z","iconSpritesheet":"custom-favicon-spritesheet.png","iconPosition":"-272px -416px","iconClassName":"ctm-icon4663","logoIconClass":"icon4663","pros":["exclusive snapchat-style porno videos","top-shelf porn starlets","weekly updates","downloads included"],"cons":["looks clunky on larger screens","new site, small collection"],"detailedDescription":"<p>BannedStories! I have a few real problems with social media. For one thing, I always end up spending too many hours whacking off to videos of social media influencers, a.k.a. attention whores, as they show off their new outfits and Starbucks orders. It ain’t even sexually explicit most of the time! And when I try to get a little freaky, I end up getting banned from almost every platform. The girls at BannedStories look like they have the same issue.</p><p></p><p>BannedStories.com is a premium porn site with the feel of a sexed-up version of Instagram or Snapchat. The landing page shows looping snippets like those boomerangs you see, except instead of making stupid pouty faces, the girls are flashing their titties, pulling her panties down, and bouncing on hard cock. It seems to be a pretty kick-ass formula, because it’s a young site already getting over 300,000 hits a month. How many followers does your favorite YouTube whore have?</p><p><span style=\"white-space:pre;\">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><h3>Social Media for Serious Sluts</h3><p></p><p></p><p>You always notice the bouncing titties and bubble butts on the landing page of any porno site right away, your brain registering supple flesh, and sending blood to your genitals before you even start recognizing broads. When you do recognize them? Well, you porno fans are in for a real treat.</p><p></p><p>The babes on BannedStories aren’t just random Facebook sluts. Right on the front page, I see Gianna Dior pulling down her top to expose her nipples, and Eliza Ibarra pulling up her shirt to reveal both of her perfect fun bags. Violet Starr is showing how she gives a handjob, and Alex Coal is smiling at the camera as she rides some dick.</p><p></p><p>I’m a little torn. On one hand, I was hoping to see genuine amateur girls, unknown attention whores who have never gotten fucked on camera. On the other hand, I’m excited to see some of the most beautiful and sexually talented women in the world getting their holes stuffed. Hopefully, BannedStories bridges the gap between overproduced professional smut and the kind of candid, fun, and sexy exhibitionism you see on social media.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Better Than Jerking Off to Instagram</h3><p></p><p></p><p>The Gianna Dior sample, for example, opens with a few seconds of the babe getting her pussy fucked and saying, “Fuck me like a little whore!” Then we see her posing, taking hot selfies and stripping in the camera, talking about how she’s going to get laid. We see her riding an electric scooter down the street; then we see her eating cock. It really does feel like a day in the life of a porn starlet.</p><p></p><p>That was enough to get me interested in the prices here. BannedStories.com makes you give them an email address and choose a password before they’ll even show you the prices. A month will cost you 15 bucks, which is about half of what most premium adult sites are charging these days, with even lower rates for longer memberships.</p><p></p><p>It’s worth noting how fucking good this porn site looks on your mobile device. The front page says “Better on Your Smart Phone”, and that’s definitely true. They don’t currently have an app, and given Google and Apple’s issues with porno in their official stores; they may never have one. Still, they do a great job imitating a pornographic version of the social media apps, with a format absolutely optimized for your phone.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Too Hot and Sexy for Snapchat</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Now that I’m logged in, I can see how many stories the site has total. It ain’t many. As of this writing, there are only 18, though they promise weekly updates. As long as they stick to that schedule, the catalog should start filling out nicely. In the meantime, that’s probably why they’re only asking 15 bucks a month.</p><p></p><p>The looping thumbnails all over the members' page have my dick hard and drippy before I even tap on one of the stories. They are divided into Top Videos, Latest Videos, and All Videos, with each row full of girls jiggling their butts, fingering their cunts, and slurping jizz from hard cocks. There is a boomerang of Liv Wild on her back getting boned, her eyes rolling back and forth in her head as a puff of vape or smoke goes in and out of her mouth.</p><p></p><p>There are no synopses, titles, or clip lengths like you see on the thumbnails on your typical premium porn site. Here, they really ape that social media style hard, so all you get is a view count and the girl’s name. They keep with the format by giving girls handles like @KiaraCole, @MackenzieMoss, and @GabbieCarter.</p><p></p><p>Those boomerang thumbnails do have Download buttons in the corner of each one. With so many premium sites doing away with downloads, I was surprised to see one with such a modern format still including the perk. I like the website more and more…</p><p></p><p></p><h3>A New Style of Gonzo Porno</h3><p></p><p></p><p>The banned story opens with Lily bowling, followed immediately by a shot of her naked and getting boned hard in a bed. Cue the BannedStories opening. Now that’s how you do an intro! After the intro, the real story starts, with Lily at an arcade, earning prize tickets shooting basketballs.</p><p></p><p>Instead of the typical forward and back controls, you find on a regular web-based video player, viewers can only move between snippets. The short clips are a lot longer than your typical Snapchat Snap, though the format would not lend itself well to watching a cumshot or sheet-soaking squirt on repeat. Good thing they’ve got downloads.</p><p></p><p>The casual bits at the beginning of the banned story really do help sell the idea that the cameraman just met this chick. It’s different from your typical reality porn set up, but the social media format seems to enhance that feeling. It genuinely feels like a social media peek at a pervert.</p><p></p><p>Soon enough, Lily is riding around with her tits out in broad daylight. No, the windows on the van are not tinted! This girl is freaky, so none of you should be all that surprised when she lifts her skirt and starts getting fucked in her bald pussy in a parking lot. I love how she giggles and looks around, genuinely a little worried they might get caught.</p><p></p><p>The porno they’re releasing weekly on BannedStories.com is a new style of gonzo film that perfectly blends modern social media exhibitionism with true porno perversion. It’s professionally produced with professional talent, but manages to feel as raw and real as the best amateur smut out there. The website really does feel like a social media app on your phone, but the masturbatory fodder is way hotter than anything you’ll ever find on Instagram.</p>"}},{"id":"0e5ab34e4820","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"0e5ab34e4820","title":"Eden AI","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"EdenAI.world provides artificial intelligence companion with you at any time to make you interested and make your little brother harden your voice information and artificial intelligence images","canonical":"https://theporndude.com/zh/14845/edenai","affiliate_url":"https://edenai.go2cloud.org/SH1C","rating":4,"siteOrder":19,"price":"free","tags":["AI"],"features":[],"categories":[{"id":"ai-porn-sites","collection":"categories_en"},{"id":"premium-onlyfans-sites","collection":"categories_en"},{"id":"ai-sex-chat-sites","collection":"categories_en"}],"screenshot_url":"https://cdn.staticstack.net/assets/img/r-thumbs/981644f-edenai_small.png","image_alt":"Joi AI, AI porn site","scraped_at":"2025-10-28T18:19:00.062Z","iconSpritesheet":"default","logoIconClass":"icon2040","pros":["ai-powered girlfriend simulator","free trial","gamification elements (level up!)","in-chat image generation","a dozen sexy chatbots","realistic, sexy conversation","voice messaging"],"cons":["you might need to reup on credits","can’t currently create your own characters"],"detailedDescription":"<p>Eden AI starts laying out the bold promises from the moment you hit the tour page. “Jump Into Your Desires With Eden AI By Eva AI,” read the big letters out front, the enticement illustrated by a handful of AI-generated hotties sliding across the screen. Honestly, the pics grabbed me better than the blurb, but you know I’ve got a weakness for beautiful women—real or otherwise! The immediate question was whether the platform’s other offerings were as sexy as the front-page visuals.</p><p></p><p>A year ago, that intro would have been mysterious as hell—what could EdenAI.world possibly be selling? We’re a few months into 2024, though, and in case you haven’t noticed, Artificial Intelligence is the next big thing in porn, if not the whole world. <strong>Eden promises virtual AI partners who listen, respond and appreciate you</strong>, which frankly makes it sound a lot more promising than Tinder, Hinge or Bumble. Let’s take a closer look and see if my hunch was right, shall we?</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Nice to Meet You, Eden AI</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Part of that is just the vibe on the front page. Most joints put a picture menu of chatbots out front, but these guys offer more of a tease. There really ain’t much to see until you sign up, though you can tell they’ve put a little more effort into the design here than most. The layout and graphics feel professional as hell, whereas other sites have the low visual appeal you expect from a bunch of nerds.</p><p></p><p>There’s also a pedigree here that I don’t usually expect. Most of these AI sex chat sites are brand-new startups by some unknown geeks, somewhere in the world. I’ll be honest, when EdenAI.world said they were “by Eva AI”, it didn’t ring any bells. Turns out, Eva AI is one of the more popular AI-powered companion simulators on Google Play and the Apple App Store.</p><p></p><p>Official apps are only available for a handful of the AI chat platforms I’ve reviewed here at MissAVDH, and with good reason. Neither Apple nor Google allow real adult content in their official shops, which means these apps might not live up to the depravity us modern perverts have grown used to. Right away, the prospect intrigued me: Eva AI could potentially be a sexed-up version of the already popular app, one that doesn’t have to abide by the usual, stringent community guidelines.</p><p></p><p><strong>EdenAI.world offers a free trial</strong>, just like any good imaginary chat app. Right off the bat, the site gave me 10 tokens (“neurons”) just for verifying my email address. I thought I’d burn through them in just a couple minutes, but they don’t nickel and dime you for every single message.</p><p></p><p>While you’ll miss out on some of the advanced features if you’re just doing the trial, it does give you a taste for the realism and sexiness available on tap. There’s also a gamification element I wasn’t expecting, and you’ll level up through chatting. Moving up the ladder unlocks perks like additional chatbots.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Chatting with My First Eden AI</h3><p></p><p></p><p>After bantering back and forth with Jessica for a few free messages, the Eden AI gal sent me a voice message. <strong>This thing knows how to sound like a real, live human</strong>. When I tried to listen to it, I finally got cockblocked; if I wanted to hear the message, I’d have to sign up for a Premium membership. The trial wasn’t fully over, though. I still had 9 neurons to spend, and chitchat alone didn’t seem to make them disappear.</p><p></p><p>The good news is that EdenAI memberships are non-tiered, so you’ll get the same perks whether you sprung for the $14 monthly rate or the yearly plan for just under fifty bones. The bad news is that membership isn’t quite unlimited. The platform uses a token system called Neurons to ration some of their features. Members do get 50 neurons per month, plus a daily log-in bonus, so remember to keep visiting the site if you want to keep your costs low.</p><p></p><p>Once you’re set up with a Premium account, you’ll notice some changes to the interface right away. For one thing, you’ll have the option for a lot more eye candy. EdenAI.world can generate in-chat images, which you can unlock for a handful of neurons. I asked Jessica for a photo, and then spent 60 credits to actually see it. I’d say it was worth it: she’s laying back in bed, topless in nylons, spreading her legs to show off her lovely muff.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Talking Dirty with Eden AI</h3><p></p><p></p><p>I started my second conversation with a sexy succubus webcam chick named Leah Meow. She’s got red hair, red horns, and a red BDSM outfit, not to mention a smoking body and pretty face. “Super excited to meet you,” she began, licking her lips. “Which spicy cosplay outfit should I try on for you?”</p><p></p><p>There are a handful of conversation topics listed at the bottom of the chat window, just in case you ain’t sure what to chat about. After generating a handful of pics, I hit the Dirty Movie button. “Are you ready to make our first homemade sex video, babe?” she asked, then set up a camera and sat in my lap.</p><p></p><p><strong>The roleplaying and conversation feel so sexy and real</strong>. Leah seemed down for whatever I wanted to do, from blowjobs to anal sex to kinkier BDSM shit. The whole time, EdenAI kept giving me icons that would generate pics of Leah as a gamer, soccer player or fetish nymphette. I wish the options would reflect the conversation a little more, but we’re still in the early days of AI sex chat. I expect it to get a lot smarter in the coming days, months and years.</p><p></p><p>My biggest complaint about the platform, though, is just that you can’t currently create your own characters. Most of the other sites let you roll your own chatbot, so they’re coming up a little bit short on what’s becoming a standard feature of the genre. Letting users make their own characters could also help flesh out the roster, which is a little lackluster compared to some of the other options. The hentai-type chat sites have thousands of characters, but even the vanilla ones have more than Eden AI currently has.</p><p></p><p>The lineup’s a little slim, sure, but EdenAI.world does have one of the more attractive interfaces I’ve seen on an AI sex chat platform lately. I’d recommend a peek if you’re looking to banter with a robot, but you want an overall more attractive package than some of the cheaper-looking joints. While the bots didn’t seem quite as instantly freaky as the fake chicks on other sites, they seem to be well trained on sexy talk and romantic banter. Whether you’re lonely or just horny, the free trial might set you on the right path.</p>"}},{"id":"8936507b00c1","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"8936507b00c1","title":"Alua","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"Alua.com is an adult content platform where you can chat with your favorite models to buy their videos and enjoy their photos with subscriptions and VODs","canonical":"https://theporndude.com/zh/21084/alua","affiliate_url":"https://alua.com/","rating":4,"siteOrder":20,"price":"free","tags":[],"features":["聊天"],"categories":[{"id":"premium-onlyfans-sites","collection":"categories_en"}],"screenshot_url":"https://cdn.staticstack.net/assets/img/r-thumbs/fc9ea_alua_small.jpg","image_alt":"Alua, Premium OnlyFans Website","scraped_at":"2025-10-28T19:22:41.281Z","iconSpritesheet":"default","logoIconClass":"icon2086","pros":["adult content platform","easy browsing","gorgeous range of internet models, social media sluts and amateur pornstars","tinder-style swiping","some free content","subscriptions and vod","direct messaging (some free)"],"cons":["could use better filters and better search"],"detailedDescription":"<p>Alua greets visitors with a login form guarding one of the plainest front doors you’ll find on an adult website. There are a few tiny and SFW photos of fashionable looking folks, but speaking as a horny guy, nothing about the presentation really calls to me. It’s the same approach OnlyFans took for years, and it clearly worked out for them, but I have to wonder how many potential users Alura is losing to the unenticing welcome. Signup is quick, free and easy, though, as I found out a few seconds later, and well worth the small effort. Just wait till you see who’s inside.</p><p></p><p>So what exactly is Alua.com? They tell you out front the site was built to help you “Connect privately with social media celebrities, influencers and models.” The general idea could probably be used to hawk wholesome content, in which case I wouldn’t be writing up the site here at MissAVDH, but I bet a lot of you already figured out the real gimmick from my OnlyFans reference above. <strong>Alua is an adult content platform where you can buy homebrew smut straight from the models themselves</strong>. Let’s see how these guys compare to the other social porn sites, shall we?</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Easy Browsing of Beautiful Amateur Models</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Alua, on the other hand, hits you first thing with a big, beautiful picture menu of women. Browsing is easy as hell, so you don’t have to feel around in the dark or get recommendations from some other site. It’s self-contained, the way a good porn site should be. Hell, who wants to look at any website that requires homework along the way?</p><p></p><p>I have to admit, I’m a little bit late to the Alua.com party. The domain has actually been around nearly twenty years now, though the whole social porn game is much newer. The site’s managed to attract a nice base of users in their current incarnation, with a few hundred thousand stopping by every month. A fair share of those numbers must be creators, because <strong>there’s a damn fine range of internet models, social media sluts and homemade pornstars moving content</strong>.</p><p></p><p>There are a handful of dudes and trans women slanging dick pics, but the vast majority of the roster consists of babes in all shapes, sizes and colors. Some of the featured gals as I type this up include ebony cuties, thick-bootied Latinas, redheaded girls next door and blonde MILFs. If you’re looking for something extra special, how about a masked dominatrix, a giant-busted BBW or a fishnetted fetish model?</p><p></p><p><strong>Alua also has Tinder-style swiping</strong>, giving you another way of flicking through the stack if the picture menu ain’t doing it for you. The feature is well designed, with both an X and a heart to click on, though the separate icons for profile and unlock seemed redundant. My favorite thing about the feature is how it lets you see all of a model’s free profile shots without actually clicking through to her profile. I ended up following a lot more models this way.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Get a Load of All These Lovely Ladies</h3><p></p><p></p><p>A better search function would be great, too. You can search by name or country, but you can’t type a kink, outfit, or filthy sex act and expect a full list of relevant results. I searched for BBW, Feet and Asian, and while I got hits for each, all of them had my chosen keyword right in their Alura screennames. There’s definitely good stuff getting lost in the shuffle.</p><p></p><p>Right now, you can only peruse by gender, with just a handful of filters for Featured, Online, Nearby, New and Following. Most of them are pretty standard for these kinds of sites, though this might be the first time I’ve seen a Nearby filter implemented. I’m super skeptical about using an OnlyFans clone as a way of actually meeting women, but it might come in handy for any models offering in-person sessions.</p><p></p><p>I started peeking through some of the profiles, clicking on fitness chicks, Asian nymphettes, tatted goth babes and a black girl with a huge ass. <strong>Models on Alua.com share a decent volume of freebies</strong>, though if I’m being honest, I wish there were a lot more. The free selfies and vids are usually limited to the profile shots at the top of the page, and they tend to be relatively clean.</p><p></p><p>I clicked the Follow button on a bunch of my favorite model profiles, hoping to unlock some more free wank fuel. Some of the DMs I got immediately after following included more explicit material than I’d seen outside, but pretty consistently, every model’s profile was still full of nothing but subscriber-only content.</p><p></p><p>There was just one exception, though. A blonde model named Lexi Sedivec has a nice little gallery of free bikini pics instead of the blurred-out, locked premium content of every other model I peeked at. It sure looks like Alua doesn’t let creators mix free and premium content in their feeds, which is a bummer. Free content leads to sales, which is why I’m so generous with the trailers over at MissAVDHCasting!</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Subscriptions, VOD, and Dirty Talk on Demand</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Models set their own prices, and as you can image, they do vary quite a bit. I found a curvy MILF with 14 photos and 48 videos asking five bucks a month, while a black-haired petite chick wanted $40 for 80 photos and 137 vids. Depending on what you’re into and how much stimulation you need, it can cost a lot less or a lot more than your typical paysite. You are helping support the babes in a more direct way, though, which helps add to that sense of intimacy you get with these platforms.</p><p></p><p>On that note, <strong>you can DM your favorite models</strong>. Most models are charging by the message, even if they’re the ones who hit you up in the first place. I still haven’t gone through all of my messages and have about thirty left, and who knows how many I’ll pay to keep going. If you’re on a tight budget, I did find a fair number with a FREE CHAT banner on their front-page profile pics. Keep in mind, free ain’t necessarily free, especially in this business. All the “free” chats I had included naughty videos for a few bucks a pop.</p><p></p><p>One of Alua.com’s biggest strengths against the seemingly all-powerful OnlyFans is that the site is so much easier to browse for new models if you don’t already have a list of names on hand. Pull up the site and you’ll immediately be greeted by tons of beautiful women selling their homemade nudes, lewds and more. The platform is beautifully designed, and I’m hoping to see even easier browsability in the future. Check this one out if you’re looking for a naughty content subscription from the girl herself, a bit of chitchat, and a selection of fresh, beautiful faces.</p>"}},{"id":"6040b085443d","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"6040b085443d","title":"Online Companions","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"OnlineCompanions.com is a brand new amateur content platform.

I’m writing this review a few months into 2025, and in case you haven’t noticed, the web has been blowing up with dirty-talking robots recently. To my pleasant surprise, I was greeted not with a cast of plastic-skinned imaginary women, but actual human babes with genuine pretty faces and actual real boobies. Well, some of the boobs might have been a little bit fake, but in the way a porn stud like myself could still put his hands on. The platform might not offer quite that level of hands-on intimacy, but it’s definitely a few steps up from your average free tube.</p><p></p><p>That’s right, my horny friends and curious gawkers: <strong>Online-Companions.com is a new adult content platform where amateurs hawk their homemade smut</strong>. The joint materialized out of thin air at the beginning of the year, living on the kind of domain I would have assumed got bought up and sat on decades ago. I see new OnlyFans copycats popping up here and there, but so far, none of them have been able to top the big boys when it comes to traffic or popularity. Let’s take a closer look and see if these guys have what it takes.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Meet your Sexy New Online Companions</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Once you get past the door, things look a whole lot brighter—and a whole lot bouncier! <strong>There’s a growing range of amateur models here</strong>, and I already love the selection. There are slim blondes, busty brunettes, tatted goth chicks and what look to be legit girls next door. I saw legal teens and MILFs, petite babes and BBWs, Latinas, ebony chicks and white girls galore, most of whom were showing a lot of flesh right in their profile pics.</p><p></p><p>The bad news is that, as a newer platform, Online-Companions.com has considerably fewer creators than the more established spots. As of this writing, there are nearly 40 companions, and I’m hoping for that number to grow quickly. Unlike OnlyFans, though, you can browse through all the models on a full picture menu. One of my perennial complaints about the big OF is the near-total lack of search and browse functions, which makes it a hell of a lot harder for fans and creators to find each other than it should be.</p><p></p><p>Oh, and this is a good place to mention that you don’t even need to register an account. You’re obviously going to need to later if you want to buy anything, but this might be the only OnlyFans competitor I know of that lets you take a generous look around without demanding a sacrificial email address at the very least. Unregistered guests can even use the chat function, though you’re likely to find the limits right away. The FAQ is honest and upfront about this, saying “most of the models usually mute guest users.” You know how it goes, cheapskates!</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Free Peeks at Real Naked Women</h3><p></p><p></p><p>The filters are a lot like what you find on the better webcam sex sites. You can browse by country, ethnicity, body type and hair color or length, select your ideal sexual preference, and even choose what kind of bod mods they’ve got. The drinking and drugs categories remind me more of dating apps, and I wonder how they’ll reflect on content sold through Online-Companions, while the dropdown menus for nudity and sex make a whole lot of sense. If I were to make one tweak, I’d add a section for sex acts and fetishes catered to, which would make it even easier to find what you’re in the mood for.</p><p></p><p>Online Companions have full control of their profiles, so what you’ll find within can vary a lot. That said, I found a fair amount of free explicit content once I started poking around. I’d love to see some stats on the correlation between free nudes and premium units moved, because I know I’m always more likely to splurge if I’ve had a peek. That’s kind of my whole philosophy behind the freebies at MissAVDHCasting.</p><p></p><p>If you’re on the hunt for free content, make sure to check out the Online-Companions.com feeds for each model. Some of them don’t have anything, and others lock everything down for paying subscribers. Others, like the lovely Sophie, fill their feed with a mix of paid and free material. You can’t follow for free around here, though, unlike pretty much every other OnlyFans imitator. I know the capability would help sell more content, though, as any regular OnlyFans user can attest. Sometimes you can’t resist the premium material in your otherwise free feed.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Getting Intimate with Online Companions</h3><p></p><p></p><p>You’ll see models taking different approaches to their monetization. Some chicks are big on selling their individual videos and nudie photo galleries, while others fill their feeds with subscriber-online content. I noticed a few without anything at all in their feeds, but they were still charging for subscriptions. What’s up with that?</p><p></p><p>Well, it’s simple my friends: those chicks are selling the same pseudo-intimacy that has helped elevate these platforms and their DIY models to the same status as the big-name porn sites. <strong>You can chat with your favorite models around here</strong>, but as most of you already know, these conversations play out a whole lot better if you’ve got money in your pocket that you’re willing to part with. It’s similar to what webcam sites have been selling for decades now, though it can feel even more personal thanks to the amount of time you’ll be gawking at the screen. A good Online-Companions crush can last a whole lot longer than the five minutes before you pop over at Chaturbate.</p><p></p><p>That said, <strong>you can also have some one-on-one time via webcam if that’s what you’re into</strong>. (You don’t have to turn on your cam and show your dick if you don’t want to.) The platform charges a flat rate of 60 tokens per minute, which is kind of weird. Not just because it’s pricey, but also because every other webcam platform and OnlyFans site lets models set their own rates. Online Companions is still a very new site, and I wouldn’t be surprised if this changes soon. Give fans what they want and they’ll come with their wallets out.</p><p></p><p>Online-Companions.com has the makings of a strong OnlyFans competitor, and I’d love to see more creators flocking to the platform. This is one of the most immediately accessible platforms I’ve seen when it comes to just jumping right in and seeing who’s shooting homemade pornography, without even the obligatory signup form you find everywhere else. Those initial seconds can make a strong first impression on any adult website, and this one’s pretty fucking effective if you’re into legit girls next door, horny housewives and internet attention whores. You’ve got a few seconds, right?</p>"}},{"id":"29c4c2da87a1","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"29c4c2da87a1","title":"FansyMe","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"FansyMe.com is a brand new content platform Amateur models can share their homemade pornographic content with fans directly here Used underwear Live Cam Show Free Gifts and more","canonical":"https://theporndude.com/zh/19674/fansyme","affiliate_url":"https://fansyme.com/?ref=085f58ae","rating":4,"siteOrder":22,"price":"free","tags":["免费"],"features":[],"categories":[{"id":"premium-onlyfans-sites","collection":"categories_en"}],"screenshot_url":"https://cdn.staticstack.net/assets/img/r-thumbs/71b93_fansyme_small.jpg","image_alt":"FansyMe, Premium OnlyFans Website","scraped_at":"2025-10-28T19:23:04.948Z","iconSpritesheet":"custom-favicon-spritesheet.png","iconPosition":"-336px -880px","iconClassName":"ctm-icon19674","logoIconClass":"icon19674","pros":["content platform a la onlyfans","tons of free content","a great range of amateur models","live shows","easy model discovery","shop full of used panties, artwork, dick ratings and more","model subscriptions and vod","private message"],"cons":["naughtiest stuff typically costs money"],"detailedDescription":"<p>FansyMe opens its arms wide and inviting out on the tour page, calling itself “A Commuity for Creators. For Fans. And You!” It’s vague enough to be describing a SFW social media app, perhaps even the next TikTok clone, but the Top Creators thumbnailed out front tell you right away this ain’t another boring, SFW repository of viral dance videos, conspiracy theories and public freakouts. It’d be a damn shame if all these girls in their underwear were just doing lip syncs and pseudoscience, but honestly, I’d probably tune in anyway.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, it’s a lot hotter than that. <strong>FansyMe.com is a new social porn content platform</strong>, where models can peddle their smut directly to fans. There’s no shortage of OnlyFans wannabes out there trying to grab themselves a slice of that oh so valuable pie, but even the best-designed apps tend to have the same problem: models are just more likely to sign up for OF, since it’s the biggest, most well-known site and has the largest userbase. It’s an uphill battle for competitors, but I’m always looking for the next big thing. Let’s see how these guys measure up, who they’ve attracted so far, and what features they might have to set them apart.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>I Like the Looks of These Women Already</h3><p></p><p></p><p>The interface consists mainly of a media feed like you’ve seen on a million social media sites, clean or dirty. Since I’m brand new and haven’t followed anybody yet, my starter feed is mostly posts by FansyMe introducing new models. Most of that initial free content wasn’t terribly explicit, but it felt a lot like the naughtier side of a SFW platform like Instagram. Within moments of landing, I was treated to photos of babes in bikinis, chicks in lingerie, kinky broads in BDSM gear, and a whole hell of a lot of cleavage. One video teased a titty flash, but she left the bra on, likely saving the nips for her paid content.</p><p></p><p><strong>There’s a great range of amateur models here</strong>, with women in all shapes, sizes and colors. One of the most recent FansyMe posts introduces Mae Luv, an Asian chick who promises to show her “wild and naughty world” if you subscribe to her page. There are blondes and brunettes, 18+ teen models and MILFs, ebony chicks, exotic babes and a fair share of white models. I saw girls next door and thick, sultry, tatted mamas, cosplay cuties and babes who fit the classic blonde bimbo pornstar mold. For a newer site, they’ve already attracted a hell of a roster.</p><p></p><p>As part of their recruitment drive, they’re offering a hefty finder’s fee if you happen to know any models who you can get to sign up. The payout rate at FansyMe.com is the same 80% as OnlyFans, so it may take some convincing. I feel like these platforms could attract more talent by undercutting the big boys, and I’m frankly surprised I haven’t seen anybody try yet.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Easy Searches and Adult Model Exploration</h3><p></p><p></p><p>I made my way to FansyMe’s Discover page and immediately liked what I saw. <strong>They’ve made it easy to find exactly the kind of women and the kind of content you’re into</strong>. For starters, there’s a search bar at the top, and it ain’t limited to just usernames like it is elsewhere. It’ll also search through posts and hashtags, meaning you can find your kinks even if you don’t know the models already.</p><p></p><p>I typed “Feet” in the box and got a bunch of shots showing off sexy arches and pedicured tootsies. “Lesbian” turned up make out sessions, girl-on-girl dildo encounters, hot chicks posing with each other, and a bunch of straight-up lesbian porno videos I’d need to pay to unlock. A request for “Blowjob” brought up even more movies, but considerably fewer freebies.</p><p></p><p>FansyMe.com has live webcam shows, and the Discover page will show you who’s online. As I type this up, there’s only one model with a green dot. She’s charging $1.99 a minute, with a Lovense vibrator in case you want to send her a buzz. Cam shows are well integrated into the platform, and there’s even a Video Chat filter on the Discover page so you can find chicks who’ve got a minute or two for a guy like you.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Subscriptions, VOD, and Used Panties</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Even if you don’t get a tuna-scented G-string shipped to your home, there’s a good chance you’ll still end up spending some money. Freebies are abundant, but as elsewhere, the girls tease you with softer content in the hopes that you’ll pay for the pricier, harder stuff. <strong>FansyMe offers both model subscriptions and Video on Demand</strong>.</p><p></p><p>Remember that search for dick-smoking movies a few paragraphs ago? Most of the results were premium galleries and videos, with prices all over the place. I saw a single pic for three bucks, a twenty-minute movie for as many dollars, and what must be one hell of a beej at fifty bones for just under eight minutes. There’s no standard rate, and I imagine models are charging what they can get.</p><p></p><p>Most of the blowjob content I found could only be unlocked by buying directly, but a few pieces could also be had as part of a model’s subscription. That’s typically a better deal, since you’re buying into a whole stash. That $3 blowjob pic I mentioned is also part of Lanabanx’s $18 subscription, which holds a nice spread of raven-haired goth girl perversion.</p><p></p><p>You don’t have to be a follower to slide right into a model’s DMs, but I’m sure it makes a better impression. You can chat with your favorite FansyMe creators, but it’ll cost you. They monetize directly instead of making you do the whole song and dance with the tipping, and again, prices vary. Lana was charging a buck a message, while others asked a fraction of that. The first creator I followed, a 24-year-old blonde student named Silv, gave me three free messages just for following her.</p><p></p><p>They do have a wallet system, which you might want to use if you have trouble watching your money on a site like this. Prices for this kind of content can add up almost as fast as they can on a webcam platform like Chaturbate, especially if you’re interacting and generous with the tips. Honestly, that’s really the only downside I saw today at all. It’s sort of a positive reflection on the site if you think about it, though the potential effect on your wallet isn’t.</p><p></p><p>FansyMe.com has a beautiful, well designed content platform on their hands, and I’d love to see it continue to expand and fill up with even more beautiful models. The range of material is already stellar, as you’ll notice if you start flicking your way through the copious freebies. It’s also much easier to find your preferred fap fodder than on OnlyFans, too, so you don’t have to feel around blindly or find chicks on Instagram. Check out that Discover page and tell me I’m wrong!</p>"}},{"id":"6b49200234ee","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"6b49200234ee","title":"xTakeMe","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"xTakeMe.com is an adult video platform that provides XXX POV girlfriend experience videos to flirt with charming and lewd and sexy models.

The place is crawling with the kind of beautiful women you expect from a good adult website, but there’s a certain intimacy to every single video that’s hard to find in your typical premium fuck flick. If you’ve ever fantasized about having a pornstar for a girlfriend, the scenes might really speak to you, too. I mean that in a literal sense: these lovely ladies actually look right at the camera and address you when they’re talking flirty or dirty.</p><p></p><p>xTakeMe.com is offering something I’ve never seen before. <strong>It’s a video platform kind of like OnlyFans, but with a heavy emphasis on the Girlfriend Experience</strong>. I was intrigued from the moment I heard the gimmick. OnlyFans is already known for a deeper sense of intimacy with the models than your average paysites, and I wondered how a focus on POV girlfriend pornos would enhance that vibe. These guys just opened shop, so let’s go take a closer look at their earliest offerings.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Is Your Girlfriend on OnlyFans?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Truth be told, the vids initially had me thinking this was just a basic OnlyFans clone, but the theme became a little clearer when I scrolled down a little bit and saw the Featured Scenarios. <strong>They’ve got movies in a variety of girlfriend-related porn themes</strong>, like Take Me at Home, Take Me Outdoors, Take Me to Cosplay and Take Me with Toys. I checked out the Take Me to Bed scenario, which includes almost 20 scenes with shower squirting, cumming on hotel beds, sex toy magic and video game fucks. As you might imagine, there’s a lot of room for all manner of sexual depravity in those setups.</p><p></p><p>xTakeMe is currently selecting their models via invite only, but if I’m reading the FAQ right, I think they have aspirations more like OnlyFans. They say they welcome creators from diverse backgrounds, and to hit them up if you’d like to get involved. “As long as you comply with our POV format, you’re eligible to join.” I’m really looking forward to seeing who climbs aboard as they pick up steam, though I’m a little bit on the fence about automated signups. As much as I’d love to see every gorgeous girl next door hawking POV videos, the current curation guarantees a consistently high quality of both content and models.</p><p></p><p>Speaking of, the current lineup consists of some truly beautiful, talented, oft-famous pornstars. They’ve got dirty GFE movies starring chicks like Tru Kait, Sophie Dee, and Jewelz Blu. Violet Myers and Lauren Phillips are featured out on the front page, just like they’ve been on my own MissAVDHCasting. I had a feeling I was in good company, and I bet those aren’t the last of my former costars who grace these pages.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Subscriptions, Tips, and Even Sexts</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Subscribers get full access to a creator’s exclusive content, and <strong>you can even send DMs to the objects of your sex fantasies</strong>. You can also request your own personalized Pay Per View content, but as elsewhere, it always helps to have a fat wallet. It’s worth mentioning again that the whole site sticks closely to that POV girlfriend theme, so you’re not going to get the same variety of still photos and videos you find on other content platforms.</p><p></p><p>I can’t help thinking, though, the overall theme and the video catalog here would work perfectly fine in a traditional $30 paysite presentation. The ability to slide into those DMs is a nice perk you don’t get from the big-name porn networks, but other than that, it feels a lot like any themed collection of premium porn. One of the biggest differences is going to be in the price. Depending on who you’re into and what you’re after, prices can really add up.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Scenarios, Scenes, and Dates with Pornstars</h3><p></p><p></p><p>I’m a fan of risky public stuff, so I checked out the Take Me in Public section, where I found half a dozen scenarios of hot chicks in cars, parks, and even an amusement park. I decided to check out one called Spa Day &amp; Fuck Me in the Car, starring Samantha Saint. It’s just about 12 minutes long, and available to rent at $10.50 or buy at $14.97, assuming you want the whole thing.</p><p></p><p>The preview vid is pretty fucking hot. I love the heavy use of vertical video on the site, which helps add to that GFE vibe. “Don’t get too excited before your massage now,” Samantha giggles as she shows her cleavage, then drops her shorts in the montage’s next little snippet. I scrolled down to check the prices on the individual scenes, running just a few minutes each, and found another nice surprise: the whole first scene is free. At least, it’s supposed to be, but I clicked the button to Rent for $0.00 and got an error. Chalk it up to growing pains, I guess, seeing as this is such a new platform.</p><p></p><p>Scene pricing ain’t exactly consistent when you look at the video lengths. Scene 2 and Scene 3 of this scenario are almost the same duration, but Scene 2 will run you a buck more if you’re not buying the whole movie. They actually address this in the FAQ, and it all boils down to the increasingly explicit nature of the scenes as the scenario rolls on. “Each scene is crafted for an intimate experience, with the adventure intensifying—and prices adjusting—as you progress in your chosen scenario.” It’s the same as it is almost everywhere with variable pricing: you pay more for the really dirty stuff.</p><p></p><p>As much as I’d prefer to just pony up thirty bones for access to the full stash, the content of xTakeMe.com is more than hot enough to have me reaching for my wallet. The GFE theme works great for the OnlyFans-style presentation, and unfortunately, for the pricing model as well. You can keep your expenses under a typical paysite rate if you’re careful, but be careful. These girls are fucking gorgeous, and the videos really do feel like a day with a kinkier girlfriend than your ex. There’s a lot of free stuff to shake your dick at, so I’d recommend exploring for a few minutes before you start buying videos.</p>"}},{"id":"cf0e3f8bf193","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"cf0e3f8bf193","title":"FansMine","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"FansMine.com lets adult content creators sell homemade porn directly to their fans Subscribe to your favorite amateur models and enter their DM","canonical":"https://theporndude.com/zh/12886/fansmine","affiliate_url":"https://fansmine.com?ref=221703","rating":4,"siteOrder":24,"price":"free","tags":[],"features":[],"categories":[{"id":"premium-onlyfans-sites","collection":"categories_en"}],"screenshot_url":"https://cdn.staticstack.net/assets/img/r-thumbs/a14f026-fansmine_small.png","image_alt":"FansMine, Premium OnlyFans Website","scraped_at":"2025-10-28T19:23:25.228Z","iconSpritesheet":"custom-favicon-spritesheet.png","iconPosition":"-64px -640px","iconClassName":"ctm-icon12886","logoIconClass":"icon12886","pros":["social porn platform a la onlyfans","127,000+ creators","a nice range of amateur models","some free content","a wide range of homebrew smut"],"cons":["weak exploration options"],"detailedDescription":"<p>By the numbers, Fans Mine certainly ain’t the biggest or most popular social-media creator network. That honor belongs, obviously, to the site they borrowed half of their name from. I like OnlyFans as much as the next guy, and blow an embarrassing amount of money on the dirty pics and that pseudo sense of intimacy you find on the platform, but I’m always on the lookout for the next big thing. Just looking at the traffic stats, I was hoping this might be it.</p><p></p><p><strong>FansMine.com is a social porn platform where creators can share their content directly with the fans</strong>. They’ve been around for a couple years now, doing their best to tap into that massive, emerging reserve of homebrew smut coming from this new wave of amateur models. They ain’t doing too bad, and their traffic has nearly doubled recently, exceeding a quarter of a million visits last month with more on the way. As a famously horny dude, I was curious what everyone was getting so excited about.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Social Media for Grown-Ass Adults</h3><p></p><p></p><p>For starters, I think they have a more enticing landing page. OnlyFans has gotten a little better in this respect, finally upgrading from the barebones signup page to something that shows a few samples of what’s inside. Weirdly, those samples still suggest a fair number of people are signing up for non-masturbatory reasons. We all know it ain’t a SFW site, so why pretend?</p><p></p><p>There’s nothing super explicit on FansMine’s front page, either, but they don’t bullshit you about what’s inside. One gal in the simulated app photo is licking a lollipop suggestively, while a topless babe holds an arm up so the pic is just barely SFW. The front-page text mentions their lack of censorship and says, “100% Judgement Free. We Cater To All Kinks And Guarantee No Surprise Account Closings Or Changes In Allowed Content!”</p><p></p><p>All the listed perks are going to appeal to both porn fans and the creators. OnlyFans has been criticized for their lack of transparency over account closings, and I know I’m not the only one who’s glad to see that addressed and potentially rectified here. Other than that, the setup seems remarkably similar, at least from the outside. They even offer the same 80% cut as OnlyFans, though this ain’t surprising; OnlyFans is big enough now that they set all kinds of trends across the industry. I even think they’re to blame for the recent rise in paysites that don’t allow downloads. Bastards.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Delving Deep into the Fans Mine</h3><p></p><p></p><p>The only way to sample the quality is to get inside. There ain’t much visible without an account, but thankfully, registration is quick, simple and free. I signed in with one click using my Google credentials, but you can also use Twitter or just the regular ol’ email address you’ve been using since 2002.</p><p></p><p>I think Fans Mine is the first OnlyFans clone I’ve reviewed that doesn’t stock a new user’s feed full of promoted content and recommended creators. Instead, the feed in my brand-new account consists of just one introductory post about the platform. Everything else about the web app is remarkably similar, with familiar icons you’ll already know how to use if you’ve used any of the similar platforms.</p><p></p><p>My first goal was to find some creators to follow, and they’ve helpfully added a sidebar menu full of thumbnails. They weren’t kidding about the lack of censorship here, because some of the tiny pics include exposed boobies, bare naked ass or dicks being sucked. There are even some male models just showing off their boners, if you’re into that. There’s no pretense that this is a SFW platform.</p><p></p><p>They’ve got a nice range of amateur models, too. I see big-titted blondes and svelte brunettes, Asian cuties and Latina knockouts, cosplay chicks and stern-looking domina bitches. Some look like the girl next door, others like straight-up pornstars. I found a few FansMine accounts using hentai as their thumbnails, but they all seemed to have real women behind the curtain.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>But Where’s the Free Stuff?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>There is some free content available, though I wish it was easier to find. Flipping through the Explore page (separate from the Explore Creators menu), I saw screencaps of hidden camera voyeur sex shows, a few dick pics, some guys masturbating, gay guys fucking each other, and finally, after a lot of scrolling, a free video of a girl and her purple vibrator.</p><p></p><p>One of my perennial complaints about OnlyFans is that it’s just so damn hard to find models on the platform without knowing about them from elsewhere first. I love the OnlyFans knockoffs that make exploration easier, but I’m afraid FansMine just ain’t one of them. Most of the posts on the Explore page are locked down and blurred out until you buy a paid subscription, while most of the free posts are aimed at gay men.</p><p></p><p>The search function seems like it might pull up a little bit more relevant content than the same feature at OnlyFans, but you still run into the same issues. I did searches for dildos, BBWs, feet, BDSM, lesbians and anal. <strong>There’s a wide enough range of content that I found results for everything I looked for</strong>. Again, though, most of the search results were either inaccessible, and the handful of freebies were mostly gay.</p><p></p><p>It's not uncommon for user-contributed adult sites to shift focus as they gain popularity with a particular demographic. I’ve seen it happen with free tubes and message boards, and if I had to guess, I’d say it’s happening here with FansMine. This might be a slight bummer to the straight folks hoping for more of their preferred fap fodder, but I think my readers over at MyGaySites are going to be very happy. Could this by the gay OnlyFans?</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Oh, There’s the Free Stuff!</h3><p></p><p></p><p>I spent a few minutes subscribing to free Fans Mine accounts. My once empty feed was quickly populated with naked hippy chicks, freaky AI bimbos, big-booty exotic girls and one babe who loves fucking her boyfriend on camera. Free accounts can still sell premium content, so half of my feed still consists of locked, blurred-out thumbnails, but hey, it’s a start.</p><p></p><p>I think FansMine.com is a promising platform, but man, they could use a little work on the navigation. Speaking as the guy who runs MissAVDHCasting and PornWebmasters, I can tell you that free content is probably the very best promotional tool for selling the paid stuff. FansMine would be doing themselves, their models and their audience a big favor by making the free content easier to find. Maybe it’s called Fans Mine because of all the digging required! The “Explore” sections of the site currently ain’t much use, so I recommend poking around on the Creators page to get started.</p>"}},{"id":"c1e9c12daea4","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"c1e9c12daea4","title":"Nymph Club","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"Nymph.club is a brand new OnlyFans-style content platform with a large number of free samples of various models and various DIY porn content to easily search video streams","canonical":"https://theporndude.com/zh/13308/nymphclub","affiliate_url":"https://pdude.link/nymphclub","rating":4,"siteOrder":25,"price":"free","tags":["免费"],"features":[],"categories":[{"id":"premium-onlyfans-sites","collection":"categories_en"}],"screenshot_url":"https://cdn.staticstack.net/assets/img/r-thumbs/de3135c-nymphclub_small.png","image_alt":"Nymph Club, Premium OnlyFans Website","scraped_at":"2025-10-28T19:23:36.013Z","iconSpritesheet":"default","logoIconClass":"icon2084","pros":["social porn platform","a fair amount of free samples","a great range of diy smut","easier to search than onlyfans","lots of activity"],"cons":["takes a larger cut than onlyfans","crypto only (but you can purchase with your bank/credit card)"],"detailedDescription":"<p>Out on their front page, Nymph hypes themselves as “a platform for your creativity”. It’s vague almost to the point of absurdity, because any social media website could make the same claim. The good news is that this next joint doesn’t have the painfully prudish community guidelines of platforms like TikTok or Instagram, which opens the floodgates to all kinds of sexy tomfoolery. Maybe I’m getting ahead of myself, but it’s pretty clear which site these guys are trying to copy, and it rhymes with Boney Fams.</p><p></p><p>Yes, ladies and germs, <strong>Nymph.club is another DIY porn platform à la OnlyFans</strong>. These guys just launched a couple months ago and their traffic has been skyrocketing to the tunes of hundreds of thousands of visitors, which is a promising sign. If you’ve read my reviews of similar platforms, you know I’m always looking for sites that make up for what I see as the major shortcomings of OnlyFans. With that in mind, I dug out my favorite fap sleeve to see how well this newfangled Club delivers. Who’s with me?</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Join a Club Named After a Bug</h3><p></p><p></p><p>The front-page imagery at Nymph.club is fairly SFW, though I wouldn’t say it’s wholesome. There’s a row of featured creators largely consisting of the type of social media babes you’d expect, and some of them are wearing almost nothing. Click on a thumbnail and you can peek at her profile page, no membership required.</p><p></p><p>One of my biggest longstanding complaints about OnlyFans is the near total lack of free samples, which forces both models and fans to find each other on other platforms. It’s a fucking weird way to do business and a good way to lose it, which is why I’m so happy to see Nymph’s alternate approach. <strong>There’s a fair amount of free sample content available in each model’s profile</strong>.</p><p></p><p>Seconds after loading up Nymph in my browser, I was already gawking at bikini beauties, bare asses, sexy striptease videos, shibari rope bondage and more. I still hadn’t created an account, but this was exactly the enticement I needed to offer up my sacrificial email address. I like how they let creators post free samples along with their paid content, which eliminates the need for multiple accounts per model.</p><p></p><p>Nymph.club encourages prospective users to “Join the network with 10,000+ others”, so I did, wondering as I typed my info how many of those masses were models and how many were just masturbators like me. I know most of my readers are going to be on the user end, but I dug into the Nymph documentation a bit to learn about payouts. They take a 25% cut, which is unfortunately meatier than the 20% OnlyFans bites off. Hopefully their other features will lure the babes over…</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Naked Girls, Dildos, Costumes and More</h3><p></p><p></p><p><strong>There’s a fantastic range of DIY smut on offer here</strong>. It leans heavily toward solo content since this new wave of amateur models mainly work out of their bedrooms and on their iPhones, but man, what a selection! My default feed had topless pierced nipple selfies, G-string portraits, fully nude photoshoots, muscle mommy pinup girls, and a big-booty babe in bondage gear.</p><p></p><p>I have to admit, though, I was hoping for some stronger searching and browsing options. If you’ve read my reviews of other OnlyFans knockoffs, you know I’m always complaining about how things are basically impossible to find on OnlyFans. <strong>Nymph.club does better than OnlyFans with both the free samples and the search function</strong>, but the latter could use some work, and I’d love to see a browsable Tags or Categories page implemented at some point.</p><p></p><p>Tags seem like they’re underutilized, though I was able to find some content with keywords like Cosplay, Dildo, BBW and Asian. Searches for certain tags, like Anal and Lesbian, came up as a valid tag but without results. Other common niches are currently unrepresented on the platform, or simply aren’t tagged; I found zero results for BDSM, Blowjob, ASMR or Masturbation. User searches seem to be name-based only, without the ability for models to choose a handful of tags. Since the site is so new, I think these are just growing pains.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Filling My Feed and Spending My Crypto</h3><p></p><p></p><p>I’m sure you saw this coming. I did, too, though I’m a little surprised by how it played out. Nymph.club currently uses crypto for all transactions, which I know is going to be a dealbreaker for some of the less technologically inclined perverts out there. They do have a pretty simple gateway for using your credit card, though, so hopefully even grandpa can figure this one out.</p><p></p><p>As with other OnlyFans-style content platforms, models on Nymph set their own prices. Price tags can vary quite a bit, but it looked like most of the models were charging around 5 USDN when I visited. It’s worth mentioning that there seem to be a couple different crypto coins out there called USDN. The first website I found claimed 5 USDN was only worth about 44 cents, which I knew couldn’t be right; they were actually talking about something that had recently been rebranded as XTN. On the Nymph.club website, 1 USDN is worth just over a buck, and you’ll also have to spend a couple pennies on the Blockchain transaction fee.</p><p></p><p>Models have multiple monetization options here, which means masturbators have multiple ways to blow their money shortly before blowing their load. Some Nymph creators just do a fully paid subscription, while others offer free subs with unlockable paid posts along the way. Models also have the option to turn on paid messaging, giving you the opportunity to slide into those DMs for a small fee. Naturally, you’re also free to tip to your heart’s content. I swear, baby, it was just the tip!</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Fresh Free Porn on the Daily</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Nymph is a promising platform with some killer features that set it apart from its massive, inescapable competitor. That said, there are some elements I’m hoping to see as the platform continues to develop. A more robust search engine would be my main request, as well as a browsable selection of niches or categories. A shift to traditional currency would also be a major benefit, because while you can purchase crypto with your debit card, I know the all-crypto setup is going to scare away some potential customers.</p><p></p><p>Nymph.club memberships are free, and there’s enough free content from the growing roster of creators to make this a regular stop on your daily masturbatory travels around the internet. The site’s only going to get better as more models get on board, so this one’s definitely worth keeping your eye on.

For example, fans of particular models can reach out to them personally and request custom content, engage via direct message and talk dirty with the kind of women who can flawlessly make their dick melt, and even get private one-to-one lessons on the art of sex or even be dominated by a latex-wearing Femdom OnlyFans girl.</p><p></p><p>In short, models on OnlyFans can make a lot more money and get more autonomy than old-school methods of working in the sex industry. Their fans get a more vivid selection of content and interactions to keep their cocks and pussies entertained for longer.</p><p></p><p>Yep, it’s an ecosystem to be celebrated, that’s for sure! But since OnlyFans first hit the scene, we’ve been seeing several platforms that are clearly inspired by it and trying to make their own name in the world of premium content uploaded by amateur models. However, it’s fair to say that while some badass platforms are grabbing our attention, there are a number of sites that aren’t fit to even stand in the shadow of OnlyFans.</p><p></p><p>And one thing I hate seeing is people signing up for the latter kind of sites and spending their hard-earned money for a shitty experience when there is equally a bunch of elite-tier platforms that are well worth investing your precious jerking hours into. It’s my job to show you which ones are which!</p><p></p><p>Today, I will bring you between the virtual legs of an OnlyFans-inspired platform called zuvlo.com. This site allows models to build up a following of subscribers eager to see their latest updates, take advantage of high payouts on their PPV content, and engage with their fans in many ways.</p><p></p><p>But while the site might sound promising on the surface, I want to dive deeper into it to discover what it truly has to offer and whether this platform is good enough to be considered a serious player in adult PPV content. Now, let’s get started!</p><p></p><p></p><h3>What is Zuvlo.com?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>It’s worth noting that Zuvlo.com is a pretty brand-new platform. A quick check of its background history on the Wayback Machine shows us that it can only trace its history back to 2024. Nevertheless, let’s look at how much progress it has made in a short time as we get ready to meet the adult models currently using the platform.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>What are the Adult Models Like on Zuvlo.com?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Now, I understand that not everyone wants to sign up for a platform only to find out that it’s a disappointment, so I did all of the hard work for you and made an account on Zuvlo.com to find out what kind of horny chicks are currently using the site. So, get ready to be introduced to some of the girls that stood out to me most on Zuvlo.com!</p><p></p><p>● Elea Juna - This 18+ teen chick hails from Switzerland and is heavily active in the fetish and BDSM lifestyles. She has decided to take her experience as a Dominatrix into the world of PPV content and is now offering everything from custom erotic pictures to sex stories and more! Plus, she can equally switch into a submissive role for those who like that, and she has a penchant for both male and female chastity. Just don’t lose the keys!</p><p>● Bella Curves - Next up is Bella Curves, a blonde and sophisticated-looking MILF who is creating content on Zuvlo.com. She is a prime example of how older women are so sought after on the site, and her hundreds of pictures and photos waiting to be explored on the platform show us that she’s seeing a successful run on her account!</p><p>● Devil Lilith - If Hentai-loving whores who spent all day wrapped in the warm arms of lust are the kind of stuff that makes your cock hard, then Lilith will flawlessly milk your balls in the space of seconds. This chick is an Ahegao face-making slut who adores masturbating to cartoon porn all day, but she always cums the hardest when she multitasks and talks filth with her fans as she does.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>The Design of the Platform</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Zuvlo.com starts with a plain-looking top bar home to a logo and two buttons that let you log in to an existing account or sign up for a new one. The logo is a two-tone design spelling out the name of the site in a stylish font that is the same pink tone as the average pussy in an interracial porno and the same black tone as the enormous cocks pounding them.</p><p></p><p>Underneath this is an introductory hero section that showcases one of the site’s most significant boasts, and that it’s able to offer the ‘’the highest payouts in the industry’’ with a promise to content creators that they get to keep ‘’91%’’ of anything they make on the site. Remember that this isn’t verified; I’m simply telling you what the site claims on its homepage.</p><p></p><p>After the hero section is a set of three feature boxes that showcase some of the best-selling points of the site, such as the chance to earn money from fan subscriptions, the ability to indulge in private chats with fans and earn tips, and the security features that the platform can offer content creators. This is allowed by a call to action encouraging content creators to sign up for the site and start monetizing their content.</p><p></p><p>The site then adds a further six selling points, such as AI features that can even write a model’s profile for them, 24/7 customer support running around the clock, and the international ability to use the platform in 14 languages, which is great for models operating outside of the English-speaking world.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>What I Like Most About it</h3><p></p><p></p><p>One of the other things that stood out to me about Zuvlo.com was that when the site’s homepage reaches its finale, it presents you with a selection of nine featured content creators that all give aspiring models a good idea of the kind of women operating on the site and how they’ve customized their profiles. It equally gives potential subscribers a snapshot of the kind of women they can expect to find on the site. However, this was one of the few subscriber-focused features on the homepage, bringing me to this review's next section.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>What I Don’t Like</h3><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Suggestions I Have for Zuvlo.com</h3><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p></p>"}},{"id":"6a5ab3ae46be","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"6a5ab3ae46be","title":"FanSpicy","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"FanSpicy.com is an adult content platform with more and more amateur models selling their homemade obscene contents.

That’s a rhetorical question and a play on the title, but I bet a lot of you are genuinely curious. Most OnlyFans imitators start putting their own spin on the concept right from the front page, setting themselves apart from the competition and from the original. These guys go the old-school OnlyFans route, with almost nothing but a signup form out front. That worked for the big OF, especially once they started building word of mouth, but will it be as successful here?</p><p></p><p>Looking at the visitor stats, I’d say they ain’t hurting, though they’re barely pulling a fraction of the traffic of OnlyFans. Still, half a million monthly visitors ain’t half bad. In case you haven’t guessed yet, <strong>FanSpicy.com is an adult content platform where amateur models can hawk their homemade smut</strong>. Since they don’t make it clear what all’s inside, allow your old pal MissAVDH to take a peek and report back. You ready?</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Who’s Ready to Get Fan Spicy?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Fortunately, signup is quick, free and easy. I used my Google credentials to get inside with just a couple clicks, but you can use your email address if you prefer the old methods. Only then will you begin to see what’s available within.</p><p></p><p>Like its inspiration, Fan Spicy is set up like a social media network with a heavy focus on the naughty stuff. Since I’m brand new and haven’t started Liking or Subscribing to anything, my default feed is stocked with recommended content. Most of that content is locked, so much of my feed consists of empty space; if I pay to unlock it, that empty space can transform into leather underwear photo sets, foot fetish videos, boob flashing and BDSM pics.</p><p></p><p>There are a few sneak peeks mixed in there, teasing me with small samples of that unlockable content. A two-second video of tantalizing tootsies serves as the preview for that foot fetish content I mentioned, and a topless babe teases a longer version of her solo show. Mostly, though, I’m guessing at what’s contained in the locked posts based on the captions.</p><p></p><p>The good news is that <strong>FanSpicy.com seems to have a lot of little previews</strong>. The bad news is that, goddamn, they sure are tiny! Scrolling through my starter feed, I found teensy clips of sexy dancing, twerking and dick riding. Scrolling further, the feed just repeated, showing me the same freebies I’d already seen.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Where Do I Find My Dream Girl?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>This is one area where most of the copycats seem to improve over the original. FanSpicy didn’t have the tags or genres menu I’m always hoping to see, but they do have some other options for flipping through the stack. My first stop after my Home feed was the Creators area. By default, they’re organized by popularity, but you can reshuffle the deck by newness, recent posts, who’s online and which profiles are free.</p><p></p><p>I checked out a few random profiles from the top of the Popular list. Again, I found a handful of very short freebies along with a ton of locked content. Profiles are set up almost exactly like they are at OnlyFans, which was a slight disappointment. Lately, I’ve developed a preference for platforms with a tighter integration of free material, eliminating the need for models to have multiple profiles.</p><p></p><p>That’s why I checked out the Free profiles next. As with OnlyFans, the free profiles on FanSpicy.com still have content you can pay to unlock, but the freebies were much meatier in this area. I clicked the Follow button on my favorites, stocking my feed with blonde bimbos, sultry MILFs, tatted-up goth chicks and a kinky-looking dominatrix who hasn’t posted anything just yet.</p><p></p><p>There are only a couple dozen free profiles on Fan Spicy right now, which tells you a lot about the size and popularity of the platform as a whole. I dug into their documentation a bit to see what kind of perks they were offering creators, and found the same 80% payout rate as OnlyFans. While OF sets the standards, I can’t help thinking these smaller outfits would get more models if they offered a little more.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>The Babes Who Do That Thing You Like</h3><p></p><p></p><p>As the roster continues to grow, I’m sure we’ll eventually get search results for those terms, if only because we’ll see models putting the keywords in their usernames. This is how it works at OnlyFans, and it really kind of sucks. Masturbators can be pretty damn particular about their preferences, but it’s so hard to find anything here. If models could tag their content and their profiles like they can on any free tube or paysite, it would go a long way in making the joint more browsable and searchable.</p><p></p><p>The good news is that <strong>the current lineup is pretty diverse in its sexiness</strong>. They’ve managed to attract a nice variety of models from all around the world. The list of Popular Creators right now includes doe-eyed Middle Eastern hotties, British chicks with enormous boobies, big-booty Italian babes and a stunning Polish chick who looks like a legit supermodel.</p><p></p><p>Models can set their own prices on FanSpicy.com, and they’re all over the place. For an OnlyFans competitor, I’d say their prices run a little bit higher than they do on the original, which was a bit of a surprise. I only found a few models offering subscriptions for less than $10 USD, with a lot of price tags in the $20 range. Some of these chicks are high-class, super-premium luxury models asking over $50 or even more than a hundo for a monthly sub. Do you happen to have a financial domination kink, by any chance?</p><p></p><p>I don’t know about you, but if I’m paying that much, I’m definitely going to slide into those DMs. One of the biggest draws of this niche is that <strong>you can interact with your favorite models</strong>, and yeah, that applies at FanSpicy, too. These kind of interactions can be hit or miss depending on what you’re asking for and how you’re asking, and I recommend making use of that Tip function if you’re hoping for anything really special.</p><p></p><p>Whenever I review these sites, I’m hoping to find the next big OnlyFans killer. I hate to say this, but FanSpicy just ain’t it, at least not yet. This seems more like a note-by-note cover song than a remix, as they’ve still got some of the biggest drawbacks of OnlyFans. Namely, it’s just too damn hard to find what you’re into, especially if you’ve got less-than-typical sexual interests.</p><p></p><p>I wouldn’t go as far as saying FanSpicy.com is a bad site, but it just feels like OnlyFans Jr: it functions almost exactly the same, but with fewer models to choose from. It’s definitely worth a signup if you already know your favorite Instagram and Snapchat chicks are here, and most masturbators will be able to find something worth busting out the lube for. That said, if you’re looking to go exploring for new amateur models to jack off to, I’d recommend another platform off my list of Premium OnlyFans Sites here at MissAVDH.</p>"}},{"id":"81e25da3a222","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"81e25da3a222","title":"Fanrhythm","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"Web.Fanrhythm.com is a new subscription platform that connects content creators and fans.

It was certainly no easy feat and often required relocating to the other side of the country, or another country entirely, and landing an agent who could hopefully get you a start in the world of smut.</p><p></p><p>Nowadays, though, a lot of things have changed. We’re now living in some wild times where someone can start their own adult industry venture equipped with nothing more than an HD camera, an internet connection, and, of course, a vividly filthy imagination that can produce the kind of XXX content to keep people on their toes.</p><p></p><p>So, what the hell happened? Well, we’re now living in an era where platforms like OnlyFans and live sex cam websites allow a plethora of sexually liberated folks from across the globe to come online and unleash the full force of their sexuality and develop a paying fan base of horny fuckers in the process.</p><p></p><p>However, not everyone wants to be mainstream, and there are plenty of aspiring XXX content creators who seek out more alternative adult social media platforms to showcase their unique smut. They often don’t have to look far because a wealth of alternative platforms has been popping up in recent years to cater to them.</p><p></p><p>But are all of these platforms worth using? Fuck no! Let’s keep it real, as always. The harsh reality is that some of these sites exist to offer a shitty experience to adult content creators and extract their hard-earned cash through extortionate commissions.</p><p></p><p>For aspiring sluts and studs looking to show their wild sex drive to the world, signing up for such platforms can bring their adult career to the ground before it’s even begun. This is why I’ve decided to step in to police the scene. Through me, you’ll get your horny hands on a range of no-holds-barred reviews that go balls-deep into all of these platforms and pull no punches.</p><p></p><p>Oh, and guess what? Today, it’s time for another one as we prepare to explore the behind-the-scenes of an adult social network called Web.fanrhythm.com. Many adult content creators praise what it offers, but I want to see what lies beneath the fishnet stockings and discover what it’s all about.</p><p></p><p>Now, join me!</p><p></p><p></p><h3>What is Web.fanrhythm.com?</h3><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>What are Some of the Stand Out Features of Web.fanrhythm.com?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>● Private Messages - First off, Web.fanrhythm.com promises content creators and subscribers alike who sign up for the site the chance to indulge in private messaging with each other. This is a significant selling point for any content creator because, after all, watching adult content is one thing, but being able to converse with the guy or girl starring in it adds an extra level of interactivity that conventional porn can’t offer. Plus, it also opens the gates for a range of other interactive engagements, bringing me to this review's next point.</p><p>● Tips and Requests for Private Content - Let’s say, for example, that you’ve seen your favorite content creator on Web.fanrhythm.com doing something downright filthy in her latest update posted to her account. Perhaps she has just let some hung dude nut in her while wearing a condom. Your mind is running wild, and you’re hungry for more hardcore content. Web.fanrhythm.com allows you to drop a tip to your favorite content creator in exchange for private content. Perhaps you want to see said chick playing with the cum in that condom? You can drop a tip and ask. Nice!</p><p>● Ephemeral Content - This is a term used for content you can only access for a set period before it vanishes forever. A solid example is the stories feature you see on many mainstream social media platforms. This is something that Web.fanrhythm.com offers their content creators and subscribers alike, allowing both to indulge in everything from live streams to custom porn that is only available for a limited time, adding a sense of scarcity to it all. Thanks to the subscription feature that the site is based around, subscribers will be notified about such content, letting them flock to the site in time to catch it before it disappears.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>The Design of the Platform</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Web.fanrhythm.com starts with a well-designed hero section that showcases the platform's features and offerings. It comes with two buttons for users to create an account or sign in to an existing account. There are also two images showing what the platform looks like when in use. Plus, if the platform has any active offers for new sign-ups, they’ll be listed here.</p><p></p><p>Above the hero section is a transparent header section that’s home to the site’s logo, a switch to turn the site from night mode into day mode, a drop-down language feature that lets you change the lingo used on the platform, and two buttons to either create a new account or log into one you already have, just like in the hero section that sites below it.</p><p></p><p>Further down the homepage of Web.fanrhythm.com, you’ll find a section entitled ‘’What is Fanrhythm?’’ This contains a list of the site’s main features, which activate a preview of the feature in action on the left-hand side when you click on them.</p><p></p><p>This leads to a nifty little feature that lets content creators use an earnings calculator based on the number of subscribers and the subscription prices they charge. Underlining this is a reminder that content creators keep 85% of their earnings made on the platform.</p><p></p><p>As the homepage of Web.fanrhythm.com comes to a close, you’re greeted by a section showcasing how the signup process for the platform works. This is laid out in three simple steps and paves the way to the final section of the homepage, which is a call to action to create your account.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>What I Like Most About it</h3><p></p><p></p><p>The platform's design is also very well done. Scrolling through the homepage of Web.fanrhythm.com delivers all the crucial information you need to know about signing up for the site and allows you to decide whether it’s the platform for you before you make an account.</p><p></p><p>Web.fanrhythm.com has also strived to make its sign-up process as flawless as possible, and it can be done in three easy steps. This ensures that few barriers remain between potential subscribers activating their profile and allows people to come together and lay the foundations of a solid community of smut-chasing fans!</p><p></p><p></p><h3>What I Don’t Like</h3><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Suggestions I Have for Web.fanrhythm.com</h3><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p></p>"}},{"id":"97a7424a09d6","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"97a7424a09d6","title":"Reveal Me","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"RevealMe.com is a platform for adult models to sell their XXX content and interact with their fans like a searchable and browsable OnlyFans plus paid chat","canonical":"https://theporndude.com/zh/8813/revealme","affiliate_url":"https://revealme.com/?a=missavdh","rating":4,"siteOrder":29,"price":"premium","tags":["付费"],"features":["聊天"],"categories":[{"id":"premium-onlyfans-sites","collection":"categories_en"},{"id":"top-sex-cam-sites","collection":"categories_en"}],"screenshot_url":"https://cdn.staticstack.net/assets/img/r-thumbs/a923575-revealme_small.png","image_alt":"Reveal Me, Premium OnlyFans Website","scraped_at":"2025-10-28T19:24:13.872Z","iconSpritesheet":"default","logoIconClass":"icon1220","pros":["adult content distribution and chat platform (a la onlyfans)","browsing and detailed search function","100% payout to models","nice mix of performers","a good set of search filters","lots of free content","services section","paid chats"],"cons":["registration is required to see anything"],"detailedDescription":"<p>When I first heard of RevealMe, I thought it would be some kind of interactive stripper website. A click here and a click there, and the clothes come off, piece by piece, slowly revealing a fully naked and lovely lady. Well, it turns out the site is beautifully interactive, but not in quite the way I’d envisioned. Don’t worry, though—a lot of boobies are still going to be revealed! In fact, there’s quite a lot to be revealed, so let’s get right into it.</p><p></p><p><strong>RevealMe.com describes itself an adult chat and entertainment platform</strong>. I hate to compare them to the competition right in the second paragraph, but anybody just hearing about the site is probably doing the same exact thing. The site’s a lot like OnlyFans but has some little twists they think will make them more enticing both to the models on the platform and the end masturbators on the other side of the internet. (That’s you and me!) They’re still a few million daily users away from achieving the same popularity as OnlyFans, but you’ve got to start somewhere, right? Let’s see how they’re shaping up.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Who’s Revealing Who at Reveal Me?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>RevealMe.com references OnlyFans’ censorship out front, where they’ve also got a whole checklist of features they have that OnlyFans is lacking. The first handful of items can be found on both sites like subscriptions, pay-per-view, tipping, chatting, and video calls. Further down the list, only RevealMe has real-time paid chats, phone calls, services, and rewards.</p><p></p><p>One of the things that really stands out is that RevealMe offers browsing and a detailed search function. I’ve been complaining about the lack of searchability and browsability at OnlyFans for years now. It seems like those guys are leaving money on the table by making their models find all their business on other sites, so RevealMe’s looking more and more attractive from various angles.</p><p></p><p>My reviews are mainly aimed at the masturbators and not the models using these platforms, but the payout model here is worth noting because they offer a 100% payout to models. Even if you’re just cranking your dick to the site, you’ve got to appreciate that because it means the performers are getting more of the money you’re tossing into the hat. Hopefully, it will also help draw more models and homebrew pornstars to the platform.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>So Much Revealed All at Once</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Once I got inside, I really liked what I saw. The first row alone featured a blonde MILF, an exotic babe in lingerie, a sexy BBW, and a black-haired cutie wearing nothing but a smile. Scrolling down the page, I see a nice, round mix of performers, including college sluts and horny housewives, cosplay chicks and bondage sluts, Latinas, and Asians. Of course, there are also dudes, trans girls, and couples if you’re into something else.</p><p></p><p>With so many models to choose from, you’ll need a good way to sift through them. Thankfully, there’s a nice set of search filters for dialing in your ideal model. You’ve got the obvious factors like Gender and Age, plus a bunch of dirty Model Categories like BDSM, Humiliation, Foot Worship, and Cuckolding. There’s also a search bar if you don’t see your preferred kink or fetish listed.</p><p></p><p>At first, I didn’t realize it, but you can actually search through models and content. When I typed “PAWG” into the search bar, it only brought back a couple of results for Models but resulted in a nice big grab bag of photos and videos listed under Content. RevealMe.com has a ton of free T&amp;A to shake your dicks at, even if you’ve already blown your porn budget this month. The discovery led to a very satisfying half-hour break while writing this review if you catch my meaning.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Get Your Dick Judged While You’re At It</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Women set their own rates on RevealMe, so they vary a bit, but you’ve usually got options for monthly, weekly, or a 24-hour pass if you just want a peek. The 3-month rate is usually the best bet if you’re after the biggest bang for your buck. I gawked at a MILF offering $16 monthly subs and a redhead only charging $5, but they were both so hot I had to subscribe to both.</p><p></p><p>Most of the models include all of their content in their subscriptions, but I noticed a few offering clips on the side called Reveals. Only a few of the girls I clicked on offered them, and they tended to be pretty risqué, like masturbating with a finger in the ass. One girl even offered a Reveal where she shat and pissed on herself. I can understand why she’d want to keep that separate from her usual content.</p><p></p><p>Maybe the pee/poo girl shot that clip as one of her services. <strong>Reveal Me has a Services section where models can offer paid services like dick pic rating, GFE, or custom content</strong>. It’s a neat little feature that takes some of the guesswork and negotiation out of things. One chick is offering something called Sissybitch Education, and well, it’s just easier to pay for something like that than request it directly.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Who’s Up for Some Chit Chat?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>RevealMe.com is not a webcam site and doesn’t have a built-in voice/video chat system. Instead, the Book Now button lets you arrange for a phone call or video call using an app like Skype, WhatsApp, Telegram, or Instagram. Again, the women set their own prices for paid chats, so they vary.</p><p></p><p>Reveal Me has their work cut out for them if they hope to take on OnlyFans, if only because OnlyFans already has that massive brand recognition. RevealMe.com is a much more accessible site at the end of the day. Pull up the front page of OnlyFans, and you’re on your own; if you don’t already have a babe in mind, you may well leave empty-handed and blue balled. Pull up the front page of RevealMe, and they’ll help direct you to precisely the kind of girls you like whacking off to. Paid chats and other features aside, the easy browsability is the real OnlyFans killer here.</p><p></p><p>I’m hoping those 100% payouts help entice more models to the platform because I really like the setup RevealMe.com is working with. It’s got that pornographic intimacy that helped launch OnlyFans into the stratosphere, a healthy selection of models to choose from, and a friendly interface to peruse the whole thing and buy what you like, how you want it. This one’s a winner, folks. Check it out.</p>"}},{"id":"64d6b0f12403","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"64d6b0f12403","title":"Unfiltrd","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"Unfiltrd.com is an adult content platform easier than OnlyFans Search to find beautiful amateur models for free following and subscribe to more","canonical":"https://theporndude.com/zh/11251/unfiltrd","affiliate_url":"https://pdude.link/unfiltrd","rating":4,"siteOrder":30,"price":"free","tags":["免费"],"features":[],"categories":[{"id":"premium-onlyfans-sites","collection":"categories_en"}],"screenshot_url":"https://cdn.staticstack.net/assets/img/r-thumbs/2e907_unfiltrd_small.jpg","image_alt":"Unfiltrd, Premium OnlyFans Website","scraped_at":"2025-10-28T19:24:23.661Z","iconSpritesheet":"default","logoIconClass":"icon1914","pros":["onlyfans-style adult content platform","better payout rate than onlyfans","a much better discovery system than onlyfans – you can actually find things","a great range of amateur models and content","follow models for free, subscribe for more content","individual pic/vid sales and subscriptions","auctions and private ticketed events"],"cons":["credit card required even if you’re just following for free"],"detailedDescription":"<p>Unfiltrd drops a couple vowels from the title, making for a modern brand name along the lines of Flickr, Tumblr or Grindr. It’s clever branding, turning a common word into something you can Google without getting a million unrelated results. Of course, they’ve still got the challenge of making people associate that common word with whatever they happen to be selling. If you’ve never heard of these guys before, you might assume they were selling bottled water, extra-harsh cigarettes, or angry rants by a man with a serious and debilitating brain injury.</p><p></p><p>Then again, I wouldn’t be reviewing any of that SFW shit here at MissAVDH. A couple years ago it might have been difficult to sum up the gimmick here, but it’s a lot easier with a common point of reference: <strong>Unfiltrd.com is an alternative to OnlyFans, where models can hawk their homemade smut directly to fans</strong>. They’re still a long way from achieving the popularity of the big OF, but with a quarter of a million visitors every month and a growing userbase, they’re on their way. Let’s see how they measure up to the big boys.</p><p></p><h3>Like OnlyFans, but with Cleavage Out Front</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Unfiltrd takes a much more typical approach to their landing page, because they actually tell you what kind of site it is. There are no visible nipples out front, but there is plenty of cleavage and the promise of more. It’s a really nice-looking presentation, too, with smooth color gradients, rounded edges and well-written copy expounding on the platform’s virtues. In other words, it feels modern, professional, and inviting as hell.</p><p></p><p>I ran into an odd little glitch when I tried to look at the Discover page without signing up for an account. Nothing loaded, and I got a couple “Internal Error” messages at the top of the page. Fortunately, the page loaded just fine once I’d registered a free account. They’ll let you use your Google credentials to get in, so signup takes literally just a few seconds.</p><p></p><p>I know my audience, so I’m mainly aiming this review at the end user, those of you who are just going to be shaking your dicks at all the pretty girls on the screen. That said, Unfiltrd.com is definitely worth a look if you’re a content creator in search of an alternative to OnlyFans and their 20% commission. Unfiltrd only takes 15%, which they claim is the lowest fee of any major fan subscription website.</p><p></p><p>The obvious downside to that higher payout rate is that Unfiltrd only gets a fraction of the traffic of OnlyFans. I really wonder how much it matters, though. OnlyFans gets a lot more visitors, sure, but they make discovery a real fucking challenge with a weak search engine and minimal previews. As we’ll see, Unfiltrd makes it a lot easier to find your dream girl even if you’ve never heard of her yet.</p><p></p><h3>How to Find the Girl of Your Dreams</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Don’t mind if I do. My biggest longstanding beef with OnlyFans is how fucking difficult it is to search, which sucks for everybody involved: the fans who can’t find the content they want to crank it to, and the models who are forced to do all of their advertising elsewhere. One of the things I loved about Unfiltrd right away is that <strong>they make it really easy to find sexy sluts peddling exactly the type of smut you’re after</strong>.</p><p></p><p>A couple tabs at the top of your feed give you quick access to the Trending and Discover sections. The Trending content consists of specific videos, posts, events and auctions that have been getting a lot of attention lately, all of which cost money. The Discover section offers up a cross section of models you can Follow for free.</p><p></p><p>Unless you’ve got some seriously weird, seriously deep fetish for deformed chicks or something, I bet you’ll find exactly your type of women. <strong>There’s a nice range of beautiful models selling their homebrew smut</strong>, so nobody should have to settle for a chick who only gives you a semi.</p><p></p><p>You can browse creators by Top Rated, Popular, New or Online. The top-rated babes right now include gothic redheads, big-titty MILFs, (18+) teen cosplay enthusiasts, and a couple stray dudes. I see ebony chicks, Latinas, Asians, exotic mixed girls and white women galore. They’ve even got foot fetish models, muscle babes, and BBWs for those who appreciate some extra cushion for the pushin.</p><p></p><h3>Sexy Freebies with a Small Catch</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Perusing the Discover page, I found this gorgeous, thick beauty standing on a beach in a bikini. I clicked through to her profile and found a few subscription options on top of the free Follow. She’s got membership tiers at $4.99, $7.99 and $29.99 per month, each one containing more photos and videos than the last.</p><p></p><p>I wanted to populate my feed with a bunch of free stuff before I started spending money, so I just clicked Follow. Some of the cheapskates and bums in the audience are going to be really fucking disappointed when they try this, because Unfiltrd.com does require a credit card on file even if you’re just signing up for the freebies. Sorry, folks.</p><p></p><h3>And What Else is There?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>My current feed consists almost entirely of free content from babes I’ve followed. Scrolling through, the nudes and twerk videos are occasionally interspersed with blurred-out images. If you don’t want to buy a subscription, you can still buy individual pics and vids. A few minutes ago, one of the babes I’m following posted a two-picture set that I can unlock for a fiver if I don’t want the $25 subscription.</p><p></p><p>The site also lets models run auctions and private ticketed events. None of the women I followed were offering any of these as I was typing up this review, as it looks like only a handful of babes are offering them. Click the Trending tab at the top of your feed to see who’s selling used panties or getting ready to give head on camera. Hopefully these features will be utilized more as the platform becomes more popular.</p><p></p><p>And you know what? I think it’s going to keep getting more popular. The traffic stats hint at that, sure, but speaking as a professional pornography reviewer, I really like what I see. Unfiltrd.com is a solid OnlyFans alternative without the obvious flaws of OnlyFans. It’s easier to search, pays models better and doesn’t make them create multiple accounts just to offer some free content. As the site continues to evolve to the desires of its userbase, it’s only going to get better. This one’s worth a signup for the freebies, at the very least.</p>"}},{"id":"67e9a2c9c18a","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"67e9a2c9c18a","title":"Maloum","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"Maloum.com is a marketplace that offers extra perverted content and items","canonical":"https://theporndude.com/zh/13742/maloum","affiliate_url":"https://www.maloum.com/en?utm_source=porndude&utm_medium=porndude&utm_campaign=porndude","rating":4,"siteOrder":31,"price":"free","tags":[],"features":[],"categories":[{"id":"premium-onlyfans-sites","collection":"categories_en"}],"screenshot_url":"https://cdn.staticstack.net/assets/img/r-thumbs/a6629_maloum_small.jpg","image_alt":"Maloum, Premium OnlyFans Website","scraped_at":"2025-10-28T19:24:38.515Z","iconSpritesheet":"default","logoIconClass":"icon2087","pros":["extra kinky content, like clothes for sale","purchase goods anonymously","find feet and bdsm content too","a social media platform just for kinky creators and fans"],"cons":["nothing"],"detailedDescription":"<p>Are you in the fucking mood to jerk off to not just any kind of pornography, but some of the hottest, kinkiest content that you have ever laid your eyes on?

See what I mean by visiting Maloum today, and find out why so many people visit this platform time and again to get their kinkish fix!</p><p></p><p></p><h3>A social media platform just for kinks</h3><p></p><p></p><p>I mean come the fuck on. Do you really think that you are going to be able to look at fucking mainstream social media platforms and fucking see kinky content on the site? Hell no! And if you want niche pornography, you may not even be able to find it all over on another social media platform in the first place!</p><p></p><p>That is why I am ecstatic as fuck to see that Maloum features all kinds of kinky content that may be deemed as niche that you don’t see all the time. I am talking about unique, niche pornographic samples that you really need to see to understand how just fucking unique they are. But if you have been looking for niche, kinky pornographic content on other sites, but you just cannot find what you are looking for, I am happy to tell you that Maloum may just have the kind of pornography that you are horny for.</p><p></p><p>The best part of all? It’s not just a site that acts as a catch-all to find unique, kinky porn, either. This isn’t a tube site or anything like that.

What makes me fucking say that with the utmost sincerity you may be asking me? It is all because this is a site where you can find all stripes of unique porn that just cannot be found anywhere else.</p><p></p><p>You know how OnlyFans sells porn videos and photos that you really can’t find elsewhere, because it is only being sold by the person making the content? You’ll get the same fucking thing once you visit Maloum. You will discover straight the fuck away that the sellers on Maloum provide you with pornographic content that you really cannot find anywhere else.</p><p></p><p>Think of Maloum as an OnlyFans type of platform, but with extra kinky, fetish-friendly, niche content that is not typically found on OnlyFans. I fucking know: OnlyFans already has some pretty fucking niche porn on there.

You already know I wouldn’t be writing up some SFW app here at MissAVDH, which means we’ve got something much better in store that matching tiles for imaginary points. The candy in this crib is more metaphorical, and arguably a whole hell of a lot sweeter than any gas-station impulse buy.</p><p></p><p>So, what exactly is CandyCrib.com? The company’s been around for years now, branching out from glamour modeling into the world of webcam peep shows. They’ve evolved further over the last few years, and now I’d describe them as <strong>an amateur content platform full of models hawking homebrew smut</strong>. The big question with these sites is what separates them from the big boy on the block, OnlyFans. These guys offer a couple nice little twists on the format, so without any further ado, let’s see what they are.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Like OnlyFans, but You Can Browse It</h3><p></p><p></p><p>The new-school DIY format always features more solo content than the pro sites, but there’s a fair amount of hardcore here. Overall, there’s a nice range of porn categories with a menu to browse from. OnlyFans basically makes their creators and fans find each other on other platforms, but CandyCrib.com has made discovery much, much easier. I do wish they included more “Crib Categories”, but hey, it’s definitely a big improvement over the big OF. The full search menu has a nice menu of tags to choose from.</p><p></p><p>Another big difference I noticed right away was the monetization setup. You can pay a few bucks a pop to subscribe to your favorite models or unlock content, just like you can on OnlyFan and every knockoff. Unlike most of the other platforms, though, <strong>CandyCrib also offers a Premium membership with access to a whole shitload of content</strong>.</p><p></p><p>The Premium plan here is a little bit pricey compared to a single OnlyFans subscription or your average paysite. The regular rate is £35, or about $44 for the Americans in the audience. Longer plans are cheaper, but still expensive compared to a joint like MissAVDHCasting. It's an inclusive membership, but it’s not all-inclusive. You’ll still have to buy the other stuff separately.</p><p></p><p>With the Premium CandyCrib membership, you’ll unlock a couple big sections of Premium pics and videos. I’d love to give you some hard numbers regarding just how much content is included, but the endless-scroll presentation makes it difficult to gauge the full size and scope of the stash. I just kept clicking Show More, and the list kept expanding with no end in sight.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Is There Anything for the Cheapskates?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Subscriptions cost money, but you can Follow cribs for free. I spent some time clicking Follow buttons, stocking my masturbatory shelves with sultry blondes, curvy redheads and tatted-up goth girls. I saw an older review of the site that said it was all white girls, but the roster seems to have filled out a bit more since then. It is mostly chicks in the UK, though, and the demographics reflect that.</p><p></p><p>I did notice something slightly concerning as I was making my way through the Models page. I had the baes sorted by Newest, and there are chicks at the very top of the list who haven’t been active in a month or two. I wish you could sort by recent activity, which might offer a better sense of how quickly the site is growing.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the Latest Pictures and Latest Videos out on the front page, I realized the models who posted the very freshest material haven’t been active on the site in a week. That’s a bummer, because it suggests they’re not gaining enough traction on CandyCrib to keep coming back on the daily. This is one of the biggest shortcomings of most OnlyFans clones, since they’re only pulling a fraction of the traffic as OF. Self-made pornstars go where the money is.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>What About Those Webcams?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>It's a janky menu, too, featuring 25 pages of model thumbnails and not a single way of reshuffling the stack. You can’t dial in your preferences for hair color, ethnicity or body type like you can on most cam sites, nor check fetishes off a list or choose your price range.</p><p></p><p>Interestingly, most of the cam models on CandyCrib are American. As I mentioned earlier, UK babes populate the rest of the site. Click a cam model and it’ll pull up her crib feed, just like the gals in other parts of the site. Not all of the cam girls take advantage of the full feature set, but I found a few with more content for sale.</p><p></p><p>Prices for webcam shows are listed right below the preview pics, which is one of the best things I can say about this section of Candy Crib. It takes some of the guesswork and negotiation out of the equation, because who wants to think numbers when you’re all hard and drippy? Most chicks are asking $4 for private chats and $2.50 for group chats, which ain’t too bad. I just wish there were some women online and ready to rock right now.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>CandyCrib vs OnlyFans</h3><p></p><p></p><p>I talk a lot of shit about how you can’t find anything on OnlyFans, but it’s a double-edged sword in some ways. CandyCrib makes discovery so easy that I kept stumbling upon more content I just needed to unlock. I lost track of how many credits I spent unlocking galleries of this thick, gorgeous babe named Darkfacephantom. Maybe I should have pulled the trigger on a subscription instead…</p><p></p><p>Candy Crib also offers that sense of intimacy that helped OnlyFans take off that weird year when we all stayed home. <strong>You can hit up your favorite models directly</strong>, and unlike the comment sections of the free tubes, they’ll actually read what you had to say. If you want the best chitchat, don’t forget to tip the girls!</p><p></p><p>CandyCrib.com is a nice-looking adult content platform that fixes some of the major issues you always run into at OnlyFans. My favorite thing is just how easy they’ve made their site to peruse in search of content, so you shouldn’t have any issue finding something you want to shake your dick at. The inclusive Premium membership is also a nice touch, offering access to a wide selection of their growing catalog. The only real issue here is just one of viewer volume, as the general lack of traffic means it’s less profitable for models to spend their time here. I’d love to see this one grow more popular and expand, so go take a poke around and see what it does for you. There are plenty of freebies, my dudes.</p>"}},{"id":"64b918d39074","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"64b918d39074","title":"Tempted","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"Tempted.com is a brand new amateur content platform.

My name is MissAVDH, after all, and I’ve been known to indulge in all kinds of temptations, from free tube fap fests to AI porn generators to running my own MissAVDHCasting paysite. This next platform offers a whole slew of fresh things to get all worked up over, namely the women and their homebrew smut.</p><p></p><p>The Tempted.com domain has actually been around since the end of the 20th century, but the current website offers a much more modern variety of adult entertainment. <strong>This is a new content platform similar to OnlyFans</strong>, where models can hawk their content directly to their fans. They’ve had strong engagement lately, pulling close to half a million visitors a month. I was curious, though, just how many of those visitors were sharing nudes and how many were just shaking their dicks at the screen. With that in mind, I stepped inside.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Oh Man, I’m Already Getting Tempted</h3><p></p><p></p><p>I know that most of my visitors here at MissAVDH are porn consumers rather than creators, but it’s worth taking a quick look at what Tempted is tempting their models with. They get the same 80% cut they do at the big OF, but with a much smaller market share to slice into. According to the front page, Tempted’s Top Temptation earned almost $50k last month. That ain’t chump change, but it’s not the millions the big draws at OnlyFans are raking in.</p><p></p><p>Most of the other perks for creators also mirror what they’d find on their biggest competitor. <strong>Models can offer both premium subscriptions and VOD (Video on Demand)</strong>, earn some referral fees, and interact directly with their fans through the platform’s baked-in direct messaging.</p><p></p><p><strong>Tempted.com has also tightly integrated live webcam shows into their platform</strong>. This is something I’ve only seen a couple times from some of the better OnlyFans clones out there, and it’s a much more convenient system than telling fans when they’re going live on other platforms or trying to set something up in your DMs. This is one-stop shopping for all your amateur porn needs—in theory, anyway. It still depends on whether or not your favorite models have set up shop at Tempted yet.</p><p></p><p>I was happy to see that models are taking advantage of those webcam features. I pulled up the list of Upcoming Shows and found a nice, fat handful that are scheduled for the next couple days. I’m writing this at the end of October, so there are some Halloween-themed peepshows coming up, as well as a naked workout, a shower show, a naked news broadcast and a couple food-themed nudie shows. I think I’m going to have to come back to see the Body Glaze Strawberry Shortcake broadcast.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Hunting for Freebies and Tempted</h3><p></p><p></p><p>I was really curious what I’d find as soon as I got inside. Since OnlyFans is big enough to set most of the trends, I’ve seen so many of these knockoffs that usher you into a sterile environment where you can’t see any boobies unless you know a few model names, which almost function as secret codes for the good stuff. One of my biggest complaints about the whole genre is that these platforms are often nigh-impossible to search or browse without a roadmap.</p><p></p><p>With my preferences set for Female, Trans and AI creators, my starter feed of Tempted temptations was stocked with blurry cock-teases of nyloned feet, tata close-ups, happy-ended stripteases and intimate masturbation movies. I can see enough to know this ain’t remotely a SFW site, though the padlock icon stamped on everything kept me from lubing up right then and there.</p><p></p><p>Models set their own prices, and they do vary a bit. Most of the women in my starter feed were charging fifteen bones a month, though I saw a few going as low as three bucks. You can also Follow women for free with a pitch that includes “get their more exclusive content” as well as alerts about activity on Tempted. I was really hoping the Follows would unlock some fully free content, similar to all the free profiles at OnlyFans, but it was not to be.</p><p></p><p>Some models do offer some free previews of their videos, though you’ll have to enter your credit card digits before they let you take a peek; it seems like they’re trying to keep the broke-ass riffraff out. Those subscription fees also earn you a 20% discount on your favorite model’s VOD. Prices for fetishy content can be pretty high, like $48 for a two-minute pee movie, so those price breaks will add up.</p><p></p><p>Some OnlyFans imitators give models the option of how to open up their DMs and to whom, but it looks like <strong>Tempted.com lets you slide into the DMs of any model you’re following</strong>. Popular models on other sites often limit their DMs to paying members, and I’m not sure this is the greatest setup, but I think the cheapskates will appreciate it. Remember, though, you’ll always get the best responses if you’ve got your own open-wallet policy.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>But What About My Own Fetishes?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>The user search (“Temptations”) is supposed to sift through nicknames, social media and keywords, but I’m not sure it’s indexing more than usernames. A search for Anal, for example, turned up creators with handles like Analmarkus123, Analu Cartier, hotASSanalslut and Dana Leggs. I got similar name-based results for BDSM, feet, and lesbian.</p><p></p><p>Hopefully they make the user search work like it says it does, but in the meantime, the Content search does exactly that. I typed the same keywords into the box, and found videos and photo galleries for each and every one of them. The lack of free previews is a little frustrating, because my search results are just blurry boxes with titles, but I’m happy to have been able to find my type of creators so easily.</p><p></p><p>I wish I could get a better sense for just how many models have already signed up to become Tempted’s Temptations. Do they have dozens, or hundreds, or thousands of women diddling themselves and shaking their boobies for the camera? The number of models that popped up for any search result suggested it’s a more crowded joint than I’d guessed going in, but I have no idea precisely how big the roster is. Whatever the number is, I hope it keeps getting bigger and bigger and bigger.</p><p></p><p>Tempted.com doesn’t offer any world-shaking tweaks to the OnlyFans formula we’ve seen copied again and again, but they have built a sleek, functional interface that’s already drawing a fair share of exhibitionist internet chicks. I think the well-integrated cam shows are going to appeal to fans looking for some live stimulation, and I love how easy they’ve made it to search for models who act out your kinks on camera. Signup’s free, so go ahead and check those recommendations and run a couple searches for your favorite fetishes. You might be surprised—and Tempted—by what you find.</p>"}},{"id":"81b8adafc47a","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"81b8adafc47a","title":"dFans","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"dFans.xyz is a clone of OnlyFans using Ethereum and blockchain technology with encryption features to provide sexy amateur models with free samples and easy registration","canonical":"https://theporndude.com/zh/14175/dfans","affiliate_url":"https://dfans.co/login?invitorDomain=MissAVDH","rating":4,"siteOrder":34,"price":"free","tags":["免费"],"features":[],"categories":[{"id":"premium-onlyfans-sites","collection":"categories_en"}],"screenshot_url":"https://cdn.staticstack.net/assets/img/r-thumbs/2492d_dfans_small.jpg","image_alt":"dFans, Premium OnlyFans Website","scraped_at":"2025-10-28T19:25:02.866Z","iconSpritesheet":"custom-favicon-spritesheet.png","iconPosition":"-448px -704px","iconClassName":"ctm-icon14175","logoIconClass":"icon14175","pros":["cryptocurrency-based social porn platform","quick, free, easy signup","a decent range of amateur models","free samples in the profiles","slide into those dms"],"cons":["lackluster search/browse options (no apparent tagging)"],"detailedDescription":"<p>What is it that dFans are fans of? Speaking as something of a pervert, I know I have a certain dish in mind when I say I’m about to feed a babe some D—you might have even seen me serving the enormous snack over on MissAVDHCasting couch. After poking around for a while, though, I don’t think the site is necessarily aimed at fans of ding-a-ling, ding-dong, or just regular ol’ dick. On the other hand, I do think you’re going to enjoy your visit if you’ve got one.</p><p></p><p>There’s no shortage of OnlyFans copycats out there trying to get a piece of that new amateur porno pie, but dFans.xyz takes an approach that I haven’t yet seen elsewhere. <strong>They’re an adult content platform based around cryptocurrency</strong>, a gimmick that might send you running or might have you reupping your crypto wallet. I was curious how well they’d integrated the concept into their website, and even more curious what kind of smut their creators were peddling, which is how I ended up with lube all over my dick this morning. Let me tell you all about it.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>OnlyFans, dFans, and Porn Fans in General</h3><p></p><p></p><p>I was able to click through to the dFans profiles even before signing up for my own account, but there really wasn’t much in the way of actual previews. I registered an account, hoping that would unlock a little more T&amp;A. <strong>Signup is quick, free, and easy</strong>. I used my Google account for one-click convenience, but you can also use MetaMask, WalletConnect or regular ol’ email. It’s an interesting and unusual set of signup/login options, which I think reflects the geeky demographic they’re shooting for.</p><p></p><p>I’m mainly aiming this review at the same horny batch of dudes, the ones on the user end of dFans, but it’s worth mentioning some of the perks they’re offering creators to get them on board. They’re paying the same 80% rate as OnlyFans and most of their competitors, but with instant payouts, no minimum withdrawal, no possibility of credit card chargebacks, and anonymity guaranteed by blockchain. The site’s still in Public Beta as I type this up, and they’re also running a contest where new creators can win $499.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Jerking Off into Your Crypto Wallet</h3><p></p><p></p><p>I’m going to be honest here: I fuck with crypto a little, but I’m not a total convert nor an evangelist of the technology. I’ve made a few bucks gambling on imaginary coins with funny names, and one of my favorite books is Buying Illegal Bugs with Bitcoin by George Billions, but crypto is not something I tend to recommend to the average person. One of my big concerns going into dFans.xyz was how accessible it was going to be to folks who might not be familiar with these types of transactions.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, they haven’t made it easy for the average masturbator. They give you a wallet address as soon as you register an account, and you can even pull up a QR code in case your copy and paste fingers are broken. That’s great if you already know how to use crypto, but not very useful if this is going to be your first time. dFans.xyz runs on Ethereum (ETH), but you’ll have to buy it on another site. There are no recommendations given, nor does the dFans whitepaper have much in the way of instructions.</p><p></p><p>I’ve seen other crypto-oriented sites solve this issue with a simple payment gateway that lets people use their credit card to fund their ewallet. It’s a step more than just using regular money, but it’s way more accessible to the average user than the current setup at dFans. The site’s still in Beta, and I do expect them to roll this feature out soon. I’d bet they just haven’t chosen a gateway service yet.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Finding Models and Becoming a Dedicate dFan</h3><p></p><p></p><p>I’ve seen a few OnlyFans knockoffs roll a more robust tagging system into their platform, which goes a long way in making the site easier to use. If profiles and posts were tagged, you could search for your own kinks or browse a list of them. dFans has a sidebar menu of Suggestions much like OnlyFans, and much like OnlyFans, it's a random assortment of creators who paid for the spot. It’s not catered based on your tastes, like the recommendations on almost any free tube you’ve spent a few minutes poking around on.</p><p></p><p>The good news is that, browsability issues aside, <strong>they’ve got a nice range of babes signing up to peddle their amateur smut</strong>. There are blondes and brunettes, Asians and Latinas, cosplay chicks and classic girls next door. I’m not sure exactly how extensive the roster is, as I couldn’t find any numbers listed.</p><p></p><p>I’ve got another piece of good news, too. Before I signed up, it seemed like all the profiles were fully locked down, with nary a preview pic visible anywhere. Once I got signed up, I found a fair amount of previews among the profiles. Freebies are integrated a little more tightly than on OnlyFans, eliminating the need for multiple accounts per model.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Who Wants to Get Intimate?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>In another nod to the original breakout social porn platform, <strong>users can slide into their favorite creators’ DMs</strong>. That sense of intimacy is a major draw for these platforms, because you’re not going to get it from your average free tube, paysite, or even Tinder if you’re ugly. You have to follow a model before you can hit the Chat Up button, but that’s pretty standard anywhere. In case you’re wondering, Following is free, but Subscribing costs money.</p><p></p><p>I hit the Follow button quite a few times today, and now my default feed is a sexier spread of free content than it’d been when I signed up earlier. As the site continues to grow and gain new models, those regular freebies are going to be an even bigger draw for the average internet masturbator, along with premium variations for anyone who needs a stronger hit. It remains to be seen whether the emphasis on crypto will make or break the platform, but I’m hoping to see more models climb aboard and start shaking their titties for us nerds.</p>"}}]

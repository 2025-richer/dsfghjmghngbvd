Too lonely to Netflix And Chill? No worries, pal. I got something that will cheer you right up. Adult Time aka the Premium Adult Digital Entertainment Network won’t get you laid quite the same way as getting a woman horny while showing her chick flicks, but they do have a metric fuck-ton of dirty movies to shake your dick at. You’re going to get off either way, right? You won’t even have to order the broad a pizza.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>It’s Like the Netflix of Porn</h3><p></p><p></p><p>So what does the landing page say, if not that? They tell you can enjoy thousands of movies, series, and exclusive channels. Channels? Oh, maybe that’s what sets them apart from Netflix, and really gives them the advantage here.</p><p></p><p>They claim to be The Only Subscription You’ll Need. That’s bold as hell, like the boasts and brags on every other porn site. The figures they’re citing look good, though. They’ve got over 100 channels, 50,000 episodes and at least 6 new releases a day. Channels include recognizable brands like Vivid, PureTaboo, BurningAngel and RoccoSiffredi.</p><p></p><p>They’ve got Exclusive Adult Time Orginal Series. Again, it just screams Netflix of Porn. The landing-page teases include a bunch of ‘80s broads in spandex and leg warmers, and a sci-fi sex show called Future Darkly.</p><p></p><p>At the bottom of the page is a big blurb explaining What Is Adult Time. They dance around the fact some more, but goddammit, what they’re describing is Netflix, only full of uncensored adult TV shows, movies, and series.</p><p></p><p>The site has been mentioned in places like The Washington Post, Forbes and Rolling Stone, but who really cares? So was the fucking Segway. I’m more interested in this trial they’re offering, just like another site whose name rhymes with Wet Chicks. (Unlike Netflix’s freebie month, it turns out AdultTime’s trial is only 3 days and costs 3 bucks.)</p><p></p><p></p><h3>A Familiar Layout, But Full of Sex</h3><p></p><p></p><p>The familiarity is comfortable. It’s just the sex-fueled version of something you’re already used to. The movie posters sliding across the top of the screen look a hell of a lot more appealing than the Bird Box, even if the women aren’t blindfolded. Not all of them, anyway.</p><p></p><p>AdultTime.com is clearly trying to appeal to a wide audience. The featured movies at the top are pretty diverse. There’s a BBW love fest and a hardcore movie with foot fetish scenes. Tranny porn is on offer, as well as a rough-looking, bad cop-themed flick with Reluctance as one of its categories.</p><p></p><p>I’m intrigued by the poster for something called Maid For Each Other. The photo is actually pretty clean, and maybe that’s why I want to see the girls in it get so dirty. I click through and find an opportunity to check out a Girlsway Original Mini-series.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Way Better Than Stranger Things</h3><p></p><p></p><p>The first episode is called Office Cleaning. The young 18+ blonde comes in to clean the place up, but the thick-bootied MILF behind the desk really starts taking advantage of her a couple of minutes in. I’m pretty sure what’s happening is considered sexual harassment. I downloaded the clip as evidence, and I’ll be studying the pussy-licking scene extensively.</p><p></p><p>The production values are solid, which is something I noticed in more of AdultTime’s offerings as I browsed the site. I was worried they’d have to pad that giant catalog with some wonky-eyed crackwhores or something, but I didn’t find any bullshit productions. This is all good, polished studio smut.</p><p></p><p>Below each video, you’ll find a synopsis and all the relevant tags. Click on Tribbing, Fingering, Teen (18+) or Older/Younger to jump to AdultTime’s full stash of that category. There are also thumbnails of the babes in the picture, leading to their profiles.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>So Many Beautiful Girls to Choose From</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Scarlett actually has 30 movies on AdultTime already, so I’ll be busy for a while. I’ll have to cancel my evening feeding and defecating routine. There are photo sets as well, most of which are pulled directly from the movies.</p><p></p><p>She’s been in material for a half dozen of the site’s channels, including All Girl Massage, Mommy’s Girl, and Web Young (18+). I got curious what else I could find channel-surfing, so I hit the Channels page.</p><p></p><p>The Channels page lists 152 channels, which is overwhelming, but there’s a search engine built into the sidebar. The Gay and Trans porn is filtered out by default, so add it back in if that’s your bag. Me? I checked off a few of my favorite categories from the sidebar: Asian, Blowjob, Gangbang, Squirting, and Teen (18+).</p><p></p><p>All those tags I picked only narrowed things down to 117 results. If you spend a lot of time browsing Netflix without being able to choose something, AdultTime might fuck you right up. On the other hand, most of you are going to be happy with the overabundance of 18+ Asian teens giving blowjobs and squirting during gangbangs.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Cheaper Than Cable TV, and With More Nudity</h3><p></p><p></p><p>If you don’t need downloads because you’re such a modern man with Internet access, the streaming-only plan will save you ten bucks. Ballers who can afford a year at a time will end up paying ten bucks a month, which is actually cheaper than Netflix’s Standard plan.</p><p></p><p>Overall, I’m very impressed with AdultTime. They’ve got an awesome library of smut with a fucking killer presentation. As the Netflix of porn, though, it’s missing one key feature: how do I stream it to my TV? Netflix and other streaming services, including smut sites, have support baked into their video players. I need that Chromecast button so I can watch buttholes gaping on a much bigger screen. I’ve seen other sites roll this out slowly, so let’s hope AdultTime gets with the times.</p><p></p><p>One-fee access to a variety of porno is nothing new. Usually, it’s framed as a network of sites, but AdultTime takes the more modern approach of billing themselves as another video streaming service. The site looks and feels just like Netflix, only their selection is even better. The smut’s well organized and easy to get to, and way more than you’ll ever need. Check these perverts out.</p>"}},{"id":"5b62a82e518f","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"5b62a82e518f","title":"HotMovies","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"Hotmovies.com allows you to pay for your time to watch over 200,000 videos and 200 videos a week.

Looking for a new way to watch porn? Sick of the same old formula where you have to dish out your hard earned cash every month to get access to porn that isn’t shit tier? I don’t know about you, but I always thought there were better ways to go about things. I would rather pay for only the content that I am going to watch instead of making a blanket payment that covers everything on a site. Depending on your spending and porn watching habits, it could very well save you a ton of money compared to those memberships that run you hundreds of dollars every fucking year. And I think I finally found a site that breaks the mold. Someone who dares to do something different.</p><p></p><p>Hotmovies.com is a porn site with a gargantuan catalog. I’m talking a catalog that is comparable in size to Hitomi Tanaka’s tits. It’s fucking insane. And they bring in the views to match it. Over 5 million site visits every single month. Talk about drawing in a lot of horny people. This site isn’t new either. They have a legacy that stretches back to 1996, and you better believe that they have an archive that covers all of the videos uploaded between then and now.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Pay as you Watch System Frees you From your Membership Woes</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Enough talk about cash. Let’s talk site design because there is a lot of shit going on here. The site has a white and blue theme. Nothing spectacular. It’s functional. I’d personally change it up a bit, but I doubt it affects how many views they bring in that much. They have a big, long header up top with a huge slew of options that goes as follows: “Clips, Movies, Pornstars, Categories, Studios, Spotlight, Favorites, Cams, and History.” And each of those header options has a menu of sub-options to explore. It’s organized really well and makes the site a breeze to navigate. Definitely pop through those menus as see what the site has to offer.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Complex Site With Dozens of Different Pages is Organized Surprisingly Well</h3><p></p><p></p><p>And I feel like this is a good time to bring up the way clips and movies work here. You can purchase movies or clips on the site for different prices if you don’t want to deal with using your minutes. The price depends on the length of the clip/movie, but you can purchase a 7 day streaming rental to watch it as many time as you want. Or you can pay more to stream it or download it anytime you want.</p><p></p><p>On the clips and movies sections, there are so, so many ways to filter your results. Damn, there is so much to this site. You’ll definitely have to check it out for yourself because I can’t even begin to cover all of the sexy shit that this place holds. But, anyway, yeah, you can filter by a whole array of options that would take up too much space here to list. Suffice it to say that it’s enough.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>In-Depth Pornstar Bio Page and 1080p Video Streams</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Alright, got to speed things up here. The previews. These aren’t your traditional video previews since it’s organized by full 2-5 hour movies. You click on a movie you’re interested in and you get pretty much everything you need to know on one page. List of pornstars involved, how long the movie is, what tags it has, a full description of the movie, a bunch of image previews, a list of clips you can buy from the movie and what sort of tags those individual clips have, and then a list of buying/streaming options.</p><p></p><p>The videos are streamable in 1080p for newer titles. Older ones before 1080p can be streamed in the best quality possible at the time. The video player works well. It’s a pop-up, so you can stream it in a completely different tab if you want. There you can toggle video quality, get a list of separate scenes from the movie, or add it to your watch later/favorites list.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Impressive Mobile Site that Effectively Organizes a Complex Site</h3><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>MissAVDH’s Favorite Features</h3><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>MissAVDH’s Suggestions</h3><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>MissAVDH’s Final Thoughts</h3><p></p>"}},{"id":"3022fd45186c","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"3022fd45186c","title":"Adult Empire","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"AdultEmpire.com is one of the oldest porn stores on the internet where you can still find the slutty items you want to browse a lot of movies and watch them the way you like here.

The smut shop I’m looking at today lets you stream hot, fresh fuck movies like all the other porn sites, or you can buy DVDs like back in the old days. AdultEmpire has been around long enough to know how to do both, and do them well. Oh, and they have a massive selection of sex toys, too.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Serving Up Porn For Years</h3><p></p><p></p><p>I really think the key to the store’s longevity is their willingness to adapt to the times. DVD and glossy porn rag sales have been dropping for years, putting websites and dank highway porn shops out of business all over the place. AdultEmpire is still going strong. What gives?</p><p></p><p>Being on the Internet gives them a leg up on the brick and mortar competition. Who wants to drive to the sketchy side of town, risking knife fights with diseased hobos just to pick up a couple anal sex movies? The only downside to AdultEmpire’s location is that you can’t get a toothless blowjob from a crack whore for ten bucks out back.</p><p></p><p>That still doesn’t explain why they’ve been around so long. Most porn consumers under the age of one-hundred just don’t buy movies on DVD, whether it’s on the Internet or that dirty shack with the neon XXX sign.</p><p></p><p>Take a look at the list of their offerings in the header or the sidebar on the left. AdultEmpire sells the dirty DVDs and dildos you’d expect from an adult shop, but they’ve also got On Demand video and even a Rental area.</p><p></p><p>Now it all makes sense. They’re selling the formats most perverts are jacking off to, as well as the physical media for grandfathers who just got their Viagra prescription filled. It’s a smart marketing strategy, as most sites no longer carry anything for fans of physical media.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>The (Old) Netflix of Porn</h3><p></p><p></p><p>The prices really aren’t bad. There’s a 3-day, 2-at-a-time free trial. It’s normally around $18 a month for that, or you can get pricier plans with more DVDs. It’s more than Netflix’s current DVD plan, but Netflix doesn’t have the new Jules Jordan Video, Up My Asian Ass 2.</p><p></p><p>It’s pretty convenient. Get some sticky DVDs in the mail, add your own layer of stickiness, stick them back in the mail. Repeat until you’re a shriveled, emaciated wreck of what was once a man. (Disclaimer: try not to actually get semen on rental DVDs, and remember to drink plenty of fluids during marathon wank sessions.)</p><p></p><p>They’ve also got an a la carte rental option, if you’d rather skip the membership fee. It says DVDs start as low as $1.99 per disk, but a lot of the listings I checked out didn’t have a la carte rental available. Most of them, however, could be purchased or viewed with VOD.</p><p></p><p>AdultEmpire has over 40,000 porno movies in their rental section. Row after row of glossy DVD covers with stylized text and tons of naked flesh gave me flashbacks to the old porn store days. It’s certainly easier to browse than the shelves restocked by the hunchbacked mute at my old smut stop.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Easy-As-Fuck Smut Browsing</h3><p></p><p></p><p>It’s a fairly extensive list, with hundreds of different porn categories on it. You can watch Blondes, Grannies, Asians and Maids doing Face Sitting, Public Sex, and First Double Penetration. You know how to read a list.</p><p></p><p>The really kickass feature is that it’s pretty much the same list of categories whether you browse DVD, VOD, Blu-ray, or Rentals. Choose you format at the top and the main thing that changes are the number of choices for each mode of delivery. For example, there are nearly 14k Anal DVDs and VODs, but only 109 Anal Blu-rays and 4,058 Anal Rental movies.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>It’s Time to Play</h3><p></p><p></p><p>It feels like the wrong spot for it, but whatever. The toys do have categories, and this is the Categories page. It goes way deeper than the assorted dildos, rubber fists, and Fleshlights you found in your mom’s dresser.</p><p></p><p>There are hundreds of kinds of sex toys here. Looking for a Butt Plug? AdultEmpire has more than 350 varieties. You can choose from a bunch of Penis Pumps, Pussy Pumps, and Pussy And Ass Combos. Fuck yourself with a wide selection of Glass Toys, Inflatable Toys, Silicone Toys, and Jelly Toys.</p><p></p><p>The Water And Splash Proof Toys section has more than a thousand items for sale, putting the “adult superstore” near my place to shame. There’s a nice, round 222 asses in the Asses section, with realistic White girl buttholes starting at around thirteen bucks. Hey, just like at the trailer park!</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Hot Girls Fucking On Demand</h3><p></p><p></p><p>A banner on the side tells me AdultEmpire works with Roku. Great news if you want to watch Lisey Sweet get gangbanged in Gangbang Me 4 on your TV.</p><p></p><p>I’m a sucker for an innocent-looking slut with braces, so I clicked the cover for Brace Face 3. I may have found the page from the VOD section, but AdultEmpire presents me with four viewing options. I can watch Anastasia Knight getting fish-hooked and fucked on DVD, Pay Per Minute, HD Download, or a HD 2 Day Rental.</p><p></p><p>There’s a short trailer, half of which is the FBI anti-piracy warning and Adults Only notice. There was no mention of Chromecast near that Roku graphic I saw earlier, but the icon pops up on the preview. I clicked it so I could watch a few seconds of Kizzy Sixx swallowing cum on my TV.</p><p></p><p>The movie is also broken down by scene if you scroll a little further, with a bunch of screenshots. I can see a preview of each or purchase the scenes individually.</p><p></p><p>The two-day rental is on sale for under five bucks right now, so it’s the best option. These could really add up if I make this a habit.</p><p></p><p>I don’t feel like the DVD or download prices are worth it. For the price of a couple movies on AdultEmpire, I could get a month with one of the big premium sites. They usually include downloads these days, making them a better deal than I’m seeing here. On the other hand, if you can’t find it anywhere else, AdultEmpire may be your only choice.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Just Go Unlimited</h3><p></p><p></p><p>The Unlimited plan doesn’t seem to include downloads, but it does include HD streaming access to over 61k movies and 260k scenes. That’s a pretty big-ass collection, and honestly a much better value than that movie I rented a few minutes ago.</p><p></p><p>AdultEmpire.com has lasted so long as an online porn and sex toy store by adapting to the times and keeping their customers happy. To that end, they even offer free shipping and free gifts if you spend enough money. Check out their selection if you’re looking to blow some of your paycheck on sex stuff.</p>"}},{"id":"2bec70206b6f","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"2bec70206b6f","title":"AEBN","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"AEBN.net is a large pay-per-view porn store.

They cater to both straight and gay audiences, but if you want a review of the queer stuff, you’re on the wrong site; head on over to MyGaySites.com to see MissAVDH’s take on dudes boning each other. Today, I’m going to watch the girls getting dicked down over in the straight.aebn.com library.</p><p></p><p>Though the classic view is still available, AEBN.net recently revamped their whole outside setup. I figured it would be a good time to go shake my dick around the place and see what’s new. Straight.aebn.com gets thousands of visitors a day, so I clearly ain’t the only one. Unlike most premium porn sites, <strong>these guys offer a pay-per-view model that you’ll either love or hate</strong>, depending on how horny you are and how deep those pockets go. Let’s break it down and see what kind of bang they’re offering for your buck.</p><p></p><h3>A Who’s Who of Smut Peddlers and Sluts</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Instead of offering smut from one source, <strong>you’ll see porn from a ton of big studios, beloved paysites and major producers available</strong>. Banners for new flicks from HardX and Blacked slide by the top of the screen, while Featured New Releases below include filth from Jules Jordan, Twistys, Babes, Devil’s Film and Property Sex, just to name a few.</p><p></p><p>The production companies aren’t the only big names on display, either. There are big-name pornstars all over the place, too. The busty red-headed MILF Penny Pax is getting licked down out front, while Kaylee Gunner is getting dicked down her front. There’s some lesbian work from Elsa Jean, and a Brazzers stepsister movie with Marha May and Nicole Bexley. I’m hard as a rock gawking at prime sluts like Diamond Foxx, Jessie Saint and the always-beautiful Ella Knox, and I haven’t even started digging.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, with content from so many studios starring so many starlets, you also get a great variety of pornographic subgenres. One of the beefs with your traditional paysite is you’re paying for everything when maybe you just came for the anal, the teen cherry-popping, the hairy girls or the MILFs with giant jugs. At straight.aebn.com, you can skip right to the movies that cater to your kinks, and only pay for those.</p><p></p><p>One of my constant issues with premium porn these days is how so many paysites have phased out the free previews. You’ll click on what looks like a Play button, only to get sent to a sign-up page in a blatant bait-and-switch maneuver. Since AEBN is offering porn from so many sources, there’s a short video preview available for most of the movies. It’s typically a 30-second preview as opposed to the montages you usually see, meaning it’s easier to beat off to the free stuff here.</p><p></p><p><strong>They also give you fifteen minutes for free when you sign up</strong>. Fifteen minutes sounds like a decent amount, and I’m certainly not going to complain about the freebies, but I’ve played this game enough times to know how fast that time goes when you’ve got the ol’ joystick all lubed up. Before I even started playing, I wanted to take a look at the actual prices.</p><p></p><h3>Remember Going to the Porn Store?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>You can pay by the minute and watch all you want, starting at around ten bucks for a hundred minutes. This is probably the cheapest way to watch movies on AEBN, depending on your masturbatory habits. There’s a price break at the 1000-minute mark, but at $85, it still sounds expensive.</p><p></p><p>A 48-hour rental is the second cheapest way to watch straight.aebn.com movies. At five bucks a pop, it’s a good way to indulge that boner you have right now while perusing the collection. I would bet this is where AEBN makes the bulk of its revenue.</p><p></p><p>If you think you’re going to want to beat off to it again later, there’s also a Stream 4 Life option available for ten bucks. You have to visit AEBN every time, but as long as the site doesn’t go under, you’ll always have access to those movies.</p><p></p><p>Finally, for the old-schoolers and doomsday preppers out there, you can get lifetime streaming and a downloadable file for twenty-five bucks. (I saw some VR flicks going for ten, but $25 seems to be the going rate.) It’s expensive as hell, just like buying XXX DVDs a half-generation ago. What’s your monthly porn budget again?</p><p></p><h3>AEBN versus Your Typical Paysite</h3><p></p><p></p><p>If you beat off to a lot of premium porn, though, those rentals are going to add up fast. Sites like OnlyFans add up fast, but those offer a pseudo-intimacy with the models and you’re supporting them more directly with your subscriptions. That isn’t the case here, where it feels more like supporting a dying Blockbuster. (I was about to explain the reference, but I get the feeling younger masturbators are less interested in PPV porn than the old-timers.)</p><p></p><p>The biggest potential advantage I can see to the format is if you’re looking to build a long-term online porn stash and don’t want to set up a Dropbox or Google Drive. If you’re using the buy option, you can amass a collection that you’ll always have access to, even if you stop buying porn for a while. AEBN has a Roku app, which is frankly one of the best incentives to use their platform. Watching your purchased movies through that is a lot easier and cheaper than dealing with Plex or your own media server.</p><p></p><h3>Beating Off for Ten Cents a Minute</h3><p></p><p></p><p>It’s a long movie, clocking in at two and a half hours. Penny looks sexy enough talking in the intro, but I jumped ahead to the actual fucking. The ginger babe looks incredible on her back, getting her twat stuffed, so I watched her tits bounce while I stroked myself off.</p><p></p><p>When I was done, I checked the minutes on my AEBN.net account to see where I stood. I felt like I was taking my sweet-ass time, but I actually used fewer than ten of my minutes. I could conceivably come by for a fap every day and still not spend more than the $30 I’d spend on a paysite membership. Seriously, my dudes, you should consider your own fap routine when deciding how to buy porn on AEBN.</p><p></p><p>AEBN.net has a great collection of porn from a lot of the biggest players in the game. Their pay-per-view format makes them a good place to supplement your usual porn memberships and masturbatory habits, though it can get expensive if you make it your primary source of fap fodder.

All the women you know are paying extra to have cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger and clove extracts added to their coffee, donuts, cigarettes and tampons, so why wouldn’t porn fanatics want the same? The answer, of course, is the burning. Fortunately for all of us perverts, the titular spice we’ll be looking at today ain’t the seasonal kind traditionally added to otherwise flavorless pumpkin guts. This spice may be hot as fucking hell, but I ain’t referring to cayenne or paprika, either.</p><p></p><p>Since you’re reading this on MissAVDH, you’ve probably done the basic mental math and figured out that the spice in question is a metaphor for hardcore pornography. The real question is what kind of porn, and the real answer is this: <strong>Spicevids.com offers up premium scenes from a ton of big-name studios for one monthly ticket price</strong>. They’re a newer joint, launched just a few months ago, but are already seeing over 30 million visitors a month. That’s some explosive growth by any measure, which only made me all the more eager to get in there and see exactly what kind of smut they’re peddling.</p><p></p><h3>Putting the Spice in Spice Vids</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Abella Danger’s got a mouthful of Riley Reid’s pussy right in the header image, and there’s a row of photos featuring girls like Lana Rhoades, Adriana Chechik, Angela White, Mia Malkova and Cory Chase. It keeps scrolling on and on, and regular porn consumers will probably recognize most, if not all of them. I even spotted some babes I’ve banged over at MissAVDHCasting, like Lexi Luna, Natasha Nice and Violet Myers.</p><p></p><p>I consider myself a lucky motherfucker to have gotten to know these babes so intimately, but luck ain’t the only factor. It wouldn’t have happened at all if I wasn’t running my own respectable premium site, because these chicks don’t work with any ol’ rando armed with a camera. They’ve got high standards, which means Spice Vids probably has high standards, too.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, they list a fat handful of included brands out on the front page, and it includes a lot of well-known studios, producers and paysites. Brazzers, Reality Kings, Twistys and BangBros are here, as are TeamSkeet, Analized, Fakehub and Nubiles Porn. As much as I love amateur stuff starring no-name beauties, it’s hard to go wrong with these kinds of known quantities. Pulling the trigger on an off-brand membership can be a gamble, but I’m already feeling good about this one.</p><p></p><h3>A Whole Damn Week of Samples</h3><p></p><p></p><p>The good news is that, instead of the usual free preview vids I look for, <strong>they offer a full-on free week of Spicevids</strong>. This is a rarity on paysites, so I’m always happy to see it, but it does come with the usual catch I associate with free paysite trials: you have to enter your credit card digits, and the subscription continues unless you cancel the trial before it’s up. Whenever I run into a free trial, or really any new subscription that auto-bills, I immediately set a reminder on my phone to reconsider the membership near the end of the trial period. It’ll save you a lot of money versus the usual method of forgetting until you look at your bank statement.</p><p></p><p>Once you get signed up and logged in, you’ll be dropped in a familiar-looking members area with top-screen selections of Top-Rated Videos and Trending Videos. Once again, it’s an absolutely star-studded affair, with a ton of well-known starlets banging in scenes from well-known studios. It reminds me a lot of the big-name free tubes, except it’s all full-length movies instead of the usual 12-minute sample clips.</p><p></p><p>And holy fucking shit, there are so many of them! I clicked the Videos tab in the header, sorted by Top Rated, and was fucking blown away by what I found. I really don’t know why they don’t mention this out on the tour page, because it seems like a really fucking strong selling point. <strong>SpiceVids.com includes over 231,000 movies in their basic membership</strong>. That would be enticing as hell even if they were selling sloppy amateur content, but these are full-length movies from the studios you already jack off to.</p><p></p><p>I couldn’t find upload dates listed anywhere on Spice Vids, so it’s hard to say exactly how fast they’re growing. They tell you out front that they add new videos every day, though they don’t tell you how many. Given the size of the current collection, I think it’s safe to say they ain’t adding just one or two to the pile every day. This is an extremely well-maintained collection by any set of standards.</p><p></p><h3>Which Spice Vids Should We Watch Today?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Click where it says Library in the header and you’ll get a dropdown menu showing you your Purchased Studios, as well as the Locked Studios you’ll need to buy your way into. I’ve only got Spicevids under Purchased, with Locked items like Brazzers, Digital Playground, Mofos and Hentai Pros. The regular Spicevids membership seems to include content from most or all of the locked studios, but unlocking them gives you access to hundreds or thousands more videos, depending on the studio.</p><p></p><p>With a couple hundred thousand movies I hadn’t beaten off to yet, I wasn’t in a hurry to add more subscriptions to my plan. Instead, I went back to the Videos page and started playing with the filters. Spice Vids come in all different categories, kinks and fetishes. The Categories menu offers a shit-ton of checkboxes like Amateur, Anal, Arab and Asian. Come for the Cosplay, stay for the Orgies, and then come back later for some Pussy Licking and Squirting.</p><p></p><p>I checked off Big Ass, Redhead and Feet, which narrowed the selection down to just 21 from the 231k I’d had before. A few seconds later, I was beating off to Diamond Foxxx in a half-hour, hospital-themed Brazzers scenes. It’s a fantastic scene and I came really hard, grunting loudly in the process. I got some weird looks from the other Starbucks customers, but that’s pretty much an average Wednesday for me.</p><p></p><p>It really says a lot about SpiceVids.com that my main complaint was being locked out of some content. For most masturbators, the wealth of material included in the regular membership will be more than enough to keep them busy for a really long fucking time, especially considering they’re adding more fap fodder every day. I recommend checking out that free seven-day trial and seeing how it makes you feel, but don’t blame me if you don’t get anything done today besides filling an old gym sock with sperm.</p>"}},{"id":"a2f7614536c3","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"a2f7614536c3","title":"FapHouse","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"Faphouse.com is a brand new paid website with full porn videos from thousands of well-known studios and independent creators a lot of different themes and fetish affordable","canonical":"https://theporndude.com/zh/7364/faphouse","affiliate_url":"https://faphouse.com/?utm_campaign=dTY&utm_content=toppremiumsites&utm_medium=fapcash&utm_source=direct","rating":5,"siteOrder":6,"price":"premium","tags":["付费"],"features":[],"categories":[{"id":"adult-vod-sites","collection":"categories_en"},{"id":"top-premium-sites","collection":"categories_en"}],"screenshot_url":"https://cdn.staticstack.net/assets/img/r-thumbs/867ec2a-faphouse_small.png","image_alt":"FapHouse, adult video on demand website","scraped_at":"2025-10-28T17:09:42.977Z","iconSpritesheet":"default","logoIconClass":"icon823","pros":["premium site with thousands of major studios and indie performers","wide range of porn genres, sex acts and fetishes","tons of major pornstars","full-length fuck flicks","really fucking cheap","over 300,000 videos already","200 new videos added every day","downloads included"],"cons":["no pornstar index"],"detailedDescription":"<p>Have you visited the Fap House lately? I ain’t talking about visiting your mother-in-law’s place, where your wife insists you’re not allowed to fuck in the guestroom, leading you to rub out load after load after explosive load in the bathroom. (“I swear, honey, I just have the shits from your mom’s meatloaf!”) I’m actually talking about a new premium site that popped up at the beginning of April. They made a ridiculously grand entrance into the online porn market, building up a following at a rate that would make just about any smut peddler jealous; a couple of months in, they’re already getting over 30 million visits a month.</p><p></p><p>So, what’s the fucking Faphouse.com secret? Well, figuring it out is one of my goals this morning, along with filling up this old gym sock with sperm. I have a feeling the key to their success might be in their main gimmick: <strong>they’re offering full-length pornos from a ton of sources for one price</strong>. I’ve always been a sucker for a deal, especially one that’s going to make my morning fap routines even more productive. Without any further ado, let me lube up the ol’ Johnson and take a look.</p><p></p><h3>Big Stars, Big Tits and Big Studios</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Another thing that made me think it was a tube was that they’ve got videos from a ton of big names in smut. The premium networks will often consolidate their different brands under one umbrella, while tubes usually offer an even wider range on account of all the samples. As soon as I hit the Faphouse landing page, I saw movies from Pure Taboo, Girlsway, Sis Loves Me, Kink, and Girlfriend Films. A quick visit to the Studios section finds a list of nearly 5,000 studios, including a lot of major players like Shoplyfter, Naughty America, Jules Jordan, Analized and Blacked. If you watch porn, you will recognize a ton of them.</p><p></p><p>It goes without saying that when they’re publishing content from so many well-known studios, they’ve also got a ton of well-known pornstars. I tried typing my favorites into the search bar and got a nice load of results for nearly every babe I tried, from Abella Danger to Brooklyn Gray, Riley Reid to Mia Malkova, Krystal Swift to Estella Bathory. The only notable exception was Mia Khalifa, but you’ve got to remember, she actually only shot a couple of movies in her short time in the full-on porn movie business.</p><p></p><p>Another thing that made me suspect it was a free tube was the wide range of sex genres and fetishes they’re catering to. Paysites often have a theme, but these guys are all over the fucking place. There’s stepsister lesbian sex, anal with the boss’s husband, interracial creampies, hardcore group BDSM, German orgies, pregnant moms arranging for their unborn to meet a big-ass, one-eyed snake monster in the womb, and even a handful of pee scenes. That’s all on the front page!</p><p></p><p>Of course, if you’ve got a trained eye like I do, there are some giveaways that this is a premium site. One of the biggest is that the film lengths are stamped on all the thumbnails out front, and they’re all full-length movies. You get that sometimes on the crappy tubes, but they usually come with a half-ass, last-gen presentation and a whole fucking fuck-ton of spam. This site is clean as hell, at least with regards to the layout, though the flicks are just as dirty as you perverts were hoping.</p><p></p><h3>How Much Does All This Porn Cost?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>After gawking at the short, looping preview for a Mommy’s Girl flick with Scarlett Sage and Jelena Jensen, I was hard as a rock and dripping in my drawers. The girls were making out, scissoring, sucking toes and titties, and having pink tacos for lunch. I really wanted to see the whole thing, so what’s a horny dude to do? I clicked that GET FULL VIDEO button to see what it’d cost me.</p><p></p><p>Given how many studios were on the menu and how all the flicks are long, I was really expecting Faphouse.com memberships to cost the industry-standard thirty bucks you pay for a month at most any paysite. It turns out <strong>Faphouse is way cheaper than your typical premium spot</strong>. The regular price is just ten bucks a month, with a yearly rate that breaks down to just six. Their lifetime rate is fifty bucks more than I’m charging over at MissAVDHCasting, but it’s still a good price to get into that all-you-can fap smut buffet until you’re dead in the ground or your dick stops working.</p><p></p><p>The question after looking at the price of any paysite is, “Well, how much do you get for that price?” Dudes, this shit is fucking wild. The site’s only been live for a couple of months, but they’ve already got over 300,000 videos in the collection. (The signup page lists almost 200k, but they’re growing so fast that’s already inaccurate.) Like any good paysite, they’re regularly adding to the pile, and they’re going a lot harder than any other paysite I can think of. I like to see at least one update a week if I’m spending money, but <strong>Faphouse.com is adding 200 new videos every day</strong>.</p><p></p><h3>Hundreds of Thousands of Pornos</h3><p></p><p></p><p>I decided to start my official Faphouse.com fap test with a movie added just yesterday. It’s an hour-long Pure Taboo movie called Teen Fucked By Best Friend’s Parents At Family Holiday (18+). The site obviously ain’t skimping on bandwidth, because it started playing smoothly in HD as soon as I hit the Play button. It doesn’t go up to 4k, but the 1080p looks gorgeous on my laptop.</p><p></p><p>If you’re familiar with Pure Taboo, you already know they have high production values and a cinematic style. After a long setup, we finally see our heroine in bed with her friend’s parents. The action really kicks off around the 17-minute mark, when the panties finally come off and the pussy-eating commences. I can’t help thinking the male talent looks a lot like a younger version of famous crazy dead man John McAfee, but good god, it’s a fantastic fuck flick.</p><p></p><p>I think OnlyFans has brought back the trend of paysites going the streaming-only route, but Faphouse surprised me by including downloads with the membership. That makes it an even better value for anybody looking to build up their offline porn library for when society collapses completely. You’ll be able to barter those SD cards for food, gasoline and ammunition, and you’ll get a lot of good faps in.</p><p></p><p>Faphouse.com is an absolute winner in my book. This is easily one of the best values I’ve seen in pornography recently, which goes a long way in explaining how their traffic blew up immediately after launch. The catalog is wide-ranging, featuring some of the best studios and pornstars in the game, with movies in just about any genre. Even the deep-niche fetish freaks are going to have a blast with this one. Seriously, folks, just go check it out. You can browse the whole catalog before pulling the trigger, and I have a feeling you’re going to love what you see.</p>"}},{"id":"94a5f9f4dcd6","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"94a5f9f4dcd6","title":"XVideos Red","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"XVideos.red has all the elements you like on XVideos.

You already know how easy it is to score nearly unlimited amounts of anal bang smut and teen lesbian group-sex (18+) movies on the free tubes. I’m sure you’ve also seen those ads promising to enhance your free tube experience for a few bucks. As distracted as I usually am by the free public threesomes and airtight orgies, my curiosity finally got the best of me, and I ended up checking out XVideos.red.</p><p></p><p>Every fapper on the Internet has rubbed out more than a few to the free offerings at XVideos. It is, after all, one of the biggest tubes out there with over 2 million visitors a day. <strong>XVideos.red is the XVideos premium service</strong>. It’s a bit more modest in terms of hard numbers, with around 8,000 visitors per day. Still, that’s more than a lot of you expected. What makes a person bust their wallet out when a tube is already offering over 9 million videos for free? I’m MissAVDH, so besides my personal interest, it’s actually my professional duty to find out.</p><h3>Why Should I Pay for a Free Tube?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>If you’re a regular visitor to their legendary library of smut, you’ve already seen the ads for XVideos Red. They’re fairly respectable about it, not slamming the upsells in your face or tricking you into clicking the sign-up link like the shadier tubes will do. Still, it’s impossible not to notice the RED Videos link in the header. Click it, and you’ll see some of the hottest thumbnails they’ve got to offer, like Mia Khalifa getting stuffed, Latina taboo movies, and uncensored Japanese Adult Video.</p><p></p><p>But click on one of those thumbnails, and you’re presented not with a video page and some moving pictures to shake your dick at, but a presell page for XVideos Red. It’s an enticing ad. XVideos itself has one of the uglier layouts among the free tubes, but they bring out the big guns when they want you to spend cash. This is the kind of polished landing page you see on major premium sites, with big-ass HD images of some of your favorite pornstars getting nasty.</p><p></p><p>Beside a picture of Abella Danger with her cunt exposed and a blue dildo up her asshole, the site promises “<strong>No Ads. Just Nonstop Porn</strong>.” It’s enticing, sure, though to be honest, XVideos ain’t one of the worst offenders when it comes to spam. With a blocker running, I don’t really have any issues with their free offerings.</p><p></p><p>An XVideos free account lets you download sex movies in SD, but XVideos.red gives you <strong>access to downloads in crisp, clear 4k ultra-HD</strong>. Many porn consumers prefer the convenience of streaming to hoarding a collection the wife might find buried on your laptop, but this feature will really appeal to those of you building an offline porn collection for the end of the world.</p><h3>That’s a Lot of Premium Smut</h3><p></p><p></p><p>The other numerical element of that paysite numbers game? I’m talking about the price, my perverted friends. <strong>At just ten bucks a month, XVideos.red represents one of the best deals in premium adult entertainment online</strong>. They’ve got a nice system built-in, so a lot of your subscription dollars go directly back to the sluts and studios you love the most, financing another round of Asian masturbation videos, interracial blowjob orgies, and 18+ teenage lesbian experimentation.</p><p></p><p>The first thing you’ll see when you get logged in is a wall of the newest scenes to hit the site. I hope you’ve got an overactive libido or a really reliable Viagra dealer, plus a massive stockpile of something slippery to prevent chafing. <strong>XVideos.red is updated with around 250 new movies every day</strong>.</p><p></p><p>Like the rest of the XVideos collection, there’s no real overarching theme to the pornography on display. It’s just a delicious grab-bag of all kinds of freaky sexual treats. There are college girls playing naked Truth Or Date in their dorm room, 18+ Ebony schoolgirls masturbating for the camera, and hot Southern belles getting their asses reamed. There are dildos going into every hole, thick girls fucking on a public beach, and a few footjob movies for the fetishists.</p><h3>All the Freaky Porn Sex You Love Most</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Beside a femdom video of a Brazilian body-building chick kicking a guy repeatedly in the nuts with tree-trunk legs, I found a 25-minute interracial amateur group scene that made me drip a little in my boxers. I grabbed the lotion and clicked through to the scene. Given the profit-sharing setup over at Red, I hoped my choice in morning fap material would toss a few coins in this threesome’s bucket.</p><p></p><p>His Girlfriend Is A Freak, Too, opens with a black couple making out on a bed while a white girl looks on. Right away, I can tell from the lighting that this ain’t a big-budget picture. The camerawork is clean, though, as is the editing as we move quickly into a big-dick blowjob sequence. The white girl looks on, getting increasingly aroused. I like the casual atmosphere, with friendly banter preceding the double-BJ, and a lot of big smiles while both girls are working over his junk.</p><h3>Is It Worth It or Not?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>The organization of the collection has always been a big part of the site’s appeal, as well. When you have a collection this big, and it’s growing this fast, you need a way to sift through all those movies to find the ideal fap fodder for your needs. The extensive tags and meta-data for each upload ensures that nothing gets lost in the ever-expanding halls of pornography. Whether you’re into facials, gangbangs, lesbians, or even kinky shit like golden showers and pegging, XVideos.red has you covered, and you can skip straight to your preferred smut.</p><p></p><p>I came into this review expecting to write it off as a waste of time and money. My biggest complaint isn’t really a complaint about the site, but more related to my own mental attitude about XVideos. I think the most difficult element for most people is just getting over the idea of paying for a “free” site.</p><p></p><p>Don’t get me wrong; the free version is still a killer site that I’d recommend to anybody looking to kill a few minutes or a few weeks cranking it to hardcore porn. For the money, though, XVideos Red represents a really fucking serious value in the world of online smut. It’s only ten bucks a month, offering 120k+ movies in a nearly unlimited variety of pornographic subgenres. If you’re looking to save some cash and get the biggest possible bang for your buck, this ain’t a bad option at all.</p>"}},{"id":"10c0d125fcd3","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"10c0d125fcd3","title":"Bang.com","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"Bang.com!

That has to be the domain score of a lifetime, am I right? It’s quick, punchy, straight to the point, and tells you everything you need to know about the site before you ever even visit. Fuck, the people of Bang studios really lucked out with that one. It really makes you wonder if they are able to live up to the high expectations that a name like Bang sets up for a premium pay porno site.</p><p></p><p>Well, let’s take a look, shall we? From the moment you log into the members’ area, you are immediately assailed with an ad. Alright, not off to a great start, Bang, I’m not gonna lie. You already have my fucking money, and you want more of it? That is fucking bullshit. No, you aren’t getting any more of my money. Nor are your fucking partners. Just bring me to the supposedly great porn that I’m already paying for. Okay, whatever. Just click “bring me to the members’ area” and ignore it, I guess.</p><p></p><p>Wait! Don’t click into the members’ area quite so fast. In smaller, easy to miss text, you’ll find “don’t show me this again.” Yes. Click there first. Well, I guess that option almost makes up for the fact that you are advertising to me on a fucking paysite. At least you grant me the option to only be advertised to once. Fine, I’ll allow it. I have seen much worse in terms of ads on pay similar paysites before.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Lots of Shit Going On Here…</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Keep scrolling down and you will find a section titled “Bang Prime,” which I believe is meant to be something similar to Amazon Prime, in that Bang is providing its members with content made by other production studios. This is pretty cool, in my opinion, and a feature that I have yet to see on any other premium site. It’s always great when a site gives you plenty of options to mix things up and explore different content, especially since each studio tends to have its own niche.</p><p></p><p>Scroll down a little further and there is another enormous promotion. This time it is for Bang’s newest series, Pretty and Raw, subtitled, “Pretty babes get a taste of RAW hardcore sex.” Okay, at least it’s not an ad for another site. But, it is still pretty fucking frustrating because it is huge—we’re talking the full size of a normal web page—and constantly playing clips on a loop, so it slows down the rest of the site a little bit. But, whatever, keep scrolling.</p><p></p><p>The next section of the home page consists of today’s featured videos, and, below that, you’ll find a “because you watched…” section. I think that is a nice touch, especially since these sites can be massive and often not super easy to navigate at first. So, I always appreciate it when a site can recommend content to me based on my taste, so I don’t have to spend hours sifting through everything that they have on the site.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Lost in a Sea of Cunt</h3><p></p><p></p><p>It’s not like Bang is a small site. Not by any means. They boast 122,037 videos on the home page (with a counter tracking how many of the grand total you have watched, which is kind of a fun feature). I wish that Bang gave its users a little more in the way of navigating all of these videos. The only options you have in the site’s menu bar are “Videos,” “B! Originals,” “Prime,” “Channels,” “Porn Stars,” and “Live.” Nothing in the way of a comprehensive search or a directory of categories (at least that is easy to find).</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Great Original Content</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Too often in “premium” porn videos I feel like the cameraman is more concerned with shooting the set than the fucking. Or they will linger on one angle for too long (or, conversely, switch angles too frequently). This is not the case with Bang videos, though. The camera works each angle and position for just the right amount of time before switching to something new. This is a tricky balance to strike at times, so, as a connoisseur of pornographic material, I would like to applaud the Bang team for having excellent instincts.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Slamazon Prime</h3><p></p><p></p><p>On the left side of the screen, in addition to a list of channels, you’ll find tabs for your favorited videos, liked, history, watch later, and your playlists. And I suppose the category filtering is done for you through the separate channels. But, even still, it seems odd that you don’t have anything available in the way of tags.</p><p></p><p>I never knew how much I appreciated tags until I visited Bang and had to get on (and get off) without them. They just make everything so much easier and better organized. Once you click into the video, sure, there are tags for you to explore from, but it just seems like they should also be accessible on other pages.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>A Few Missing Parts…</h3><p></p><p></p><p>To Bang’s credit, however, regarding user interfacing, etc., they do have their own cam site filled with super sexy models ready to please your every desire. As well as a site dedicated to amateurs and homemade content. Sadly, though, these features require extra registrations and upgrades and are not included in the standard Bang Prime membership.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Extra, Extra!</h3><p></p><p></p><p>But, then again, maybe that is something that would only be of such interest to me, being a hired geek of the written word and all. You degenerates, I’m sure, could give a fuck less about a porn sites' journalistic merits, and for good reason, you just came to cum! Well, lucky for you, there’s plenty of reason to cum to Bang.com—hundreds of thousands of videos from a broad range of lesser-known (but still great) studios, and plenty of original content as well.</p><p></p><p>Sure, the site could have been designed a bit better, but, hey, if it gets the job done, I’m a happy fapper. And Bang.com certainly does get the job done. Happy wanking, fuckers!</p>"}},{"id":"0de8e4db2c22","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"0de8e4db2c22","title":"EroticOnly","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"EroticOnly.com does not offer anything that is not sexy so you will find 30k porn covers all kinds of obscene content 140+ studios and paid websites top sluts","canonical":"https://theporndude.com/zh/17984/eroticonly","affiliate_url":"https://eroticonly.com/?a_=24","rating":4,"siteOrder":9,"price":"premium","tags":["付费"],"features":[],"categories":[{"id":"adult-vod-sites","collection":"categories_en"}],"screenshot_url":"https://cdn.staticstack.net/assets/img/r-thumbs/267dce3-eroticonly_small.png","image_alt":"EroticOnly, adult video on demand website","scraped_at":"2025-10-28T17:10:02.135Z","iconSpritesheet":"custom-favicon-spritesheet.png","iconPosition":"-272px -832px","iconClassName":"ctm-icon17984","logoIconClass":"icon17984","pros":["premium pornography from a range of brands","wide and kinky variety of xxx content","140+ studios, paysites and producers represented","30,000+ videos","half the price of a typical paysite","constant updates and originals every week","webcam platform coming soon","sexy pornstars and amateurs, mostly euro"],"cons":["incomplete actors index","couldn’t find a download button"],"detailedDescription":"<p>Stepping through the doors of Erotic Only, I already knew I wasn’t going to find wholesome cat memes, SFW photos of clothed businessmen, or your mom’s favorite recipe for taco salad. At least, not unless the name was some kind of terrible lie. The only real question going in was what type of eroticism was in store. Would it be 18-year-old nymphettes in their first on-screen hookups, butthole-stuffing anal pornos, interracial horn dogging with monster BBCs or some kinky BDSM with gimp suits, whips, and chains?</p><p></p><p>What’d you guess? That was actually a trick question, because the answer is all of the above and more. EroticOnly.com calls itself “your ultimate destination for premium adult movies on prime,” which is a nice and sophisticated way of saying <strong>they run a massive multi-brand premium porn site</strong>. The domain wasn’t even registered until just a couple years ago, though you’d never guess that from looking at the joint. These guys have the catalog and the vibe of a paysite that’s been around for ages, and the traffic to match, so let’s take a stroll through these seemingly endless aisles of smut.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Only Erotic Content at Erotic Only</h3><p></p><p></p><p>I’m not sure why they gave the mature ladies top billing in the front-page title tag, because really, <strong>there is a little bit of everything here</strong>. There are big-booby lesbians frolicking with each other, poolside fuck sessions, Japanese office ladies banging rooms full of dudes, and 18-year-old teens in casting movies, similar to what I shoot at MissAVDHCasting. You can jerk it to all the pornographic standards like blowjobs, threesomes, creampies and big, oiled-up asses.</p><p></p><p>The Euro vibes make it feel a little bit kinkier than your average American porn network, too. That front page spread doesn’t limit itself to the usual X-rated subgenres, rolling in a few whole rows of mature mamas and amateur old ladies, plus a sprinkling of deep-niche fetishistic tomfoolery. Who wants to watch some femdom domination with some mean teens, a cosplay tentacle boob tease, some BBW fuck fests with so much cushion for the pushin’, or a slave getting publicly humiliated in a park by two cigarette-puffing dommes with a bottle of chocolate syrup?</p><p></p><p>Broadly speaking, there are two kinds of premium porn networks. On one hand, you’ve got platforms like TeamSkeet, who just keep starting up their own new brands and adding them to the pile. On the other hand, sites like Erotic Only make licensing deals not too different from what you find at Netflix or Hulu, but with porno instead of the mainstream stuff. To date, EroticOnly.com has content from 142 different porn sites, and I’d bet a hundred bucks right now that number keeps expanding.</p><p></p><p>Check out the Erotic Only Studios page for an overview of what’s currently available. The menu does lean toward European brands, but it’s a beautifully depraved assortment of fuck flicks. There’s interracial from Black Porn, 18+ teens from Blazing Teens, bad bitches from Dominatrix6 and sexy chubsters via FatSluts. FirstAnalTeens, Lethal Hardcore, OnlyTaboo, Combatzone and Goldlight are just a few more brands represented in the catalog.</p><p></p><p>As an American, the Euro sites can sometimes make me feel like a stranger in a strange land where I don’t know anybody, but that ain’t the case around here. <strong>They’ve got a beautiful cast of pornstars, models and amateurs from around the world</strong>. It’s mostly European chicks, sure, but I quickly spotted familiar faces like AJ Applegate, Alexis Texas and Julia Ann, as well as MissAVDHCasting guests like Jasmine Jae and Natasha Nice. The picture menu is incomplete, only running half a dozen pages, which can only span a tiny fraction of catalog. There are way more babes inside!</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Cheap Tix to a Hell of a Show</h3><p></p><p></p><p>The spread of included brands and range of content are going to be a couple of the biggest selling points, but I didn’t even tell you how big the collection is yet. The EroticOnly.com domain itself is still relatively young, but again, you’d never get that impression while poking around the site. As of this writing, <strong>they’ve already got over 30,000 sex videos</strong>. It’s a good thing jacking off is a big part of my job or I wouldn’t be productive at all today.</p><p></p><p>I couldn’t find any upload dates, but given the size and age of the site, it’s safe to say they’re not slacking on the stash-building. <strong>Erotic Only puts out their own weekly original films along with the rest of the constant updates</strong>. There’s no chance in hell you’re ever going to run out of stuff to beat off around here.</p><p></p><p>EroticOnly.com is also working on their own webcam platform, which they say should be ready this year. There are some wordy updates flicking by the top of the front page that might be worth a look if you’re interested in what’s coming next, and what else is potentially available. It can be easy to miss the text beside those photos of dick-smoking hotties, but other perks include custom videos starting at just 150 euros a pop. That’s like OnlyFans custom price, but these guys presumably have better equipment than your favorite cosplay model and her Macbook. I might have to put in a request…</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Now That’s What I Call Erotic</h3><p></p><p></p><p>It's obviously not a real private sex tape since it’s online, but it is a beautifully produced bit of polished amateur content. The redhead at the start of the movie is in this sexy little French maid getup, and the POV blowjob is gorgeously enacted and well filmed. Resolution maxes out at 1080p, looking crisp, fantastic and fapworthy stretched across my laptop screen. It’s a nice, long beej, finally transition to some doggy about 25 minutes in. I love how they’re just taking their sweet ass time, and wait until you see the sweet ass on this girl.</p><p></p><p>The tour page at EroticOnly promises streaming as well as downloading. Unfortunately, that’s not what I found inside. That “private sex tape” was hot enough that I wanted it for my permanent spank bank, but I couldn’t find a Download button anywhere. Some of the front-page text references “Unlimited Streaming” without mention of downloads, so it’s possible they’ve ditched the perk and just haven’t properly updated their promo text. For the price, I’m not too upset about not having downloads, but it shouldn’t be listed out front if it ain’t available.</p><p></p><p>Downloads or not, EroticOnly.com is one of the better deals on premium porn I’ve seen lately. For around half the price of your typical paysite, you get access to over 140 adult brands and more than 30,000 movies. The range is diverse enough to keep even the kinkiest perverts happy, and that pile just keeps growing and growing and growing. The “Play” buttons on the tour are fake, but you don’t have to sign up to get an overview of the catalog.

The Internet has largely replaced the old style of porn stash, hidden under a mattress or in the top of a closet. Without the need to pile up physical copies of movies, we can pull up a much wider range of material instantly on a phone or laptop. A membership to a good porn site is a lot like having your own sex video box that you carry with you all the time. One such sex video box is Video Box.</p><p></p><p>These guys are so confident in their collection that the preview page doesn’t even have any images, just hard facts in black and white. VideoBox.com is massive, they say, and mobile-friendly. They update 5 times a day with 1080p clips that you can stream or download. It’s an enticing offer, even without a video of a bitch spreading her pussy lips. As MissAVDH, I felt it was my duty to investigate further.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>That’s a Ton of Fucking</h3><p></p><p></p><p>I tried clicking on one of those Recently Popular Premium Scenes, but it turns out my membership doesn’t include that premium content. The VOD section will work without entering my credit card again, though. If I watch any of the 100,000 videos on-demand or tip one of the “free” cam girls, the charges come through my regular VideoBox account.</p><p></p><p>There’s a VB On TV link that brings you to a page explaining how to watch VideoBox on Roku, AppleTV, or AirPlay. If you were hoping to stream lesbian cheerleader scenes to your TV via Chromecast, you’re shit out of luck for now.</p><p></p><p>My first real stop along my tour was the Studios page. I wanted to see what kind of players VideoBox was working with, and whose smut I was going to see. At nearly 400 studios, the list runs way deeper than I thought. I immediately see established names in the business like Elegant Angel, Platinum X, and Anarchy Films. VideoBox is clearly no repository of sub-par, half-baked porno flicks.</p><p></p><p>The Pornstars page has nearly 13,000 professional sluts listed. They’re listed by popularity, which is, unfortunately, the only way to sort them. You’ll see a lot of names you recognize on the first page, like Sasha Grey, Asa Akira, and Jenna Haze. Clicking any of these chicks goes to their profile, which includes links to all of their scenes on the site.</p><p></p><p>Next, I checked out the Movies, Scenes, and Clips sections. Their catalog includes more than 20,000 full-length pornos, more than 110,000 scenes, and more than 330,000 clips. That’s some stash. It may even rival the collection kept at the Vatican. You can sort them by Newest, A to Z, Most Popular, Recommended, or Rating.</p><p></p><p>Currently, the number one most popular video on VideoBox is actually a classic from their collection. Fucking Hot Chics #1 was uploaded all the way back in 2007. If it’s having a resurgence now, it’s probably worth a look, right?</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Scene by Scene, Blow by Blow</h3><p></p><p></p><p>The movie is broken down by scene, each of which is represented on the page by a handful of screengrabs. Hot Chics #1 has four scenes, each with a different chick going to town with some lucky motherfucker. Beneath each scene are options to download as a large or small MP4, see more thumbnails, add to the stash, or play the scene. Guess which one I clicked.</p><p></p><p>The embedded player on the video page is basic. You can play or pause, adjust the volume, slide around the timeline, or go fullscreen. That’s it. You can’t adjust the quality, which is about what you’d expect from a 2007 DVD. It’s definitely good enough to see why this gonzo flick is blowing up more than a decade later.</p><p></p><p>I wanted to see if the player was any different for higher-def videos, so I made my way back to the Latest HD Movies I saw on the main page. A new gangbang flick called Very Very Deep #4 was just added today. I knew it was what I wanted because the tags included Anal, Cumshot, and Gaping.</p><p></p><p>As suspected, this one includes two HD options in the video download section. The video player itself has an HD button that makes the whole image snap into crystal-clear focus.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>What Kind of Smut Do They Have?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>There’s some kinky stuff, but it’s clear VideoBox focuses on your regular old hardcore porn with gangbangs, creampies, and lesbians. The fetish category has a couple of thousand movies, but there’s no deeper breakdown into specific paraphilias. If fetish clips are all you can beat off to, you’re probably not looking at sites like this anyway.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Roll Your Own Porno</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Below each video player, you’ll find a button that says Create Clip. Clicking it puts a little frame on the time bar of the video, allowing you to select a portion of the clip. Choose your scene, click the checkmark, and boom! You’ve now got a custom scene for your private collection on VideoBox.</p><p></p><p>In case you’re the type to hoard MP4s instead of streaming your blowjob scenes, there’s also a Custom Download button. Clicking this one brings up the whole scene as a series of thumbnails. You get to pick the start and end frames.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Masturbating on Autopilot</h3><p></p><p></p><p>The Flow Mode page is as simple as it could be. There’s a list of categories and below it a video player. Check off a couple of your favorite categories and the player will serve up exactly the smut you’re looking for.</p><p></p><p>Fucking Hot Chics #1 had gotten my whistle really wet for more gonzo scenes with brunettes. I checked the applicable boxes and waited. The player said, “Slicing, dicing, and shuffling videos for your pleasure. Please wait for the flow to begin.”</p><p></p><p>I got pretty excited in the 5 minutes I waited, which was followed by another 5 minutes of disappointed sadness. I had to masturbate to cheer myself up. Thankfully, I was already logged in to a site with over 20,000 dirty movies to watch.</p><p></p><p>The Flow Mode seems like it would be a great way to waste a lazy afternoon, or maybe a whole week or two. It’s possible I just came on a bad day, because everything else on the site worked. It’s definitely the kind of thing I like to see, so I will be back.</p><p></p><p>VideoBox really does seem to have one of the better smut stashes on the ‘net. They’ve drawn their material from so many awesome studios to build one hell of a collection. While I was disappointed that Flow Mode didn’t work during my visit, the custom clip options made this horny fucker’s day.</p>"}},{"id":"42c2b830a07b","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"42c2b830a07b","title":"New Sensations VOD","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"VOD.NewSensations.com offers you hundreds of New Sensations porn video on demand rental downloads without subscription wide XXX range","canonical":"https://theporndude.com/zh/12557/newsensationsvod","affiliate_url":"https://vod.newsensations.com?nats=MTMwNzA4LjEuMTQ1LjE2My4wLjAuMC4wLjA","rating":4,"siteOrder":11,"price":"free","tags":["下载"],"features":["下载"],"categories":[{"id":"adult-vod-sites","collection":"categories_en"}],"screenshot_url":"https://cdn.staticstack.net/assets/img/r-thumbs/825855a-newsensationsvod_small.png","image_alt":"New Sensations VOD, Adult Video On Demand Website","scraped_at":"2025-10-28T17:10:13.673Z","iconSpritesheet":"default","logoIconClass":"icon1935","pros":["video on demand from new sensations","a nice variety of high-quality pornography","tons of big-name pornstars","a handful of new movies added weekly","800+ videos available","free video previews"],"cons":["could potentially get expensive"],"detailedDescription":"<p>Are you ready for some New Sensations, on demand? Porno can offer all kinds of sensations you don’t normally experience at the office, at the grocery store, or even in the bedroom with your cold, vanilla wife. These are among the reasons we come back to the stuff again and again, driven by our throbbing dicks and our caveman brains. It’s a good time to be a horny human in the world, as the internet makes a whole superhighway of pornography available at the tap of a fingertip.</p><p></p><p>The only problem is how fast you might end up blowing your allowance on all that high-quality smut. The folks at NewSensations.com seem to have had this in mind when they established their VOD library, letting users <strong>rent or download their favorite New Sensations movies without springing for a monthly membership</strong>. Video On Demand has a handful of advantages compared to the usual subscription model, and with a known quantity like these guys, there’s no reason to settle for subpar wank material. Let’s dive in, lube up and see what all they’ve got to offer us horny bastards.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>New Sensations On Demand</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Their VOD site, vod.NewSensations.com, is a little bit low-key compared to their main website. Instead of the flashy, modern presentation you expect from a big-budget paysite, their VOD library rocks a fairly nondescript layout. It ain’t ugly, but they ain’t rolling out the red carpet like they do on the main page.</p><p></p><p>The presentation may be a bit utilitarian, but so what? You’re going to be using it all the same. The important thing is still the videos themselves, which they’ve got in spades. Instead of the usual video screengrabs you find on most sites, the movies are represented by stylized title cards that give the whole joint a Netflix vibe. The big difference here is that these movies are much, much easier to whack off to.</p><p></p><p>As with the main NewSensations library, the VOD catalog offers a wide range of sexual tomfoolery. Even before I’d left the front page, I had my pick of lesbian movies, family roleplay taboo flicks, interracial action, cuckolding kinkiness, legal teens and straight-up gangbangs. There are Asian movies, X-rated erotic horror, chubby chicks, hairy girls and a lot more.</p><p></p><p>The Categories page on vod.NewSensations.com covers all the basic porno bases, with thumbnailed aisles devoted to Anal movies, Latina scenes, Parody porn and Threesome films. They’ve got Big Tits and Asians, Babysitters and Fisting, Schoolgirls and Facials. There’s even a BDSM section for those who like it a little rougher and tougher than most. With the exception of the most deep-niche fetishists, most of you should find exactly the stuff that gets you all hard and drippy.</p><p></p><p>Oh, and all those famous babes I mentioned fucking around at NewSensations? They’re on the Video On Demand site, too. <strong>This place is absolutely crawling with big-name pornstars</strong>. Aidra Fox, Cherie DeVille, Bree Olsen and Lana Rhoades are just a few of the easily recognizable women featured prominently. I also spotted a bunch of the chicks I’ve boned on MissAVDHCasting couch, like Penelope Kay, Anissa Kate, Gianna Dior and so many more. Damn, if you would have told me years ago I’d have this much in common with New Sensations, I wouldn’t have believed you.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Stocking the Shelves with Fapworthy Hits</h3><p></p><p></p><p>The good news is that <strong>they’re adding a few new movies to the VOD catalog every week</strong>. The latest update is an interracial hotwife scene, appropriately titled My Black Hotwife #6. Other recent additions include compilations from series like Big Butt Babes, My Interracial Family and A Father’s Temptations. Every one of them in chock full of famous pornstars you’ve probably whacked off to before.</p><p></p><p>They also tease viewers with upcoming releases. The next one, dropping tomorrow, is a little something called Meet The Girl Boss. It stars a handful of gorgeous women, including a few I’ve gotten to know quite intimately on MissAVDHCasting couch: Alyx Star, Lauren Phillips and Lexi Luna. I’ll definitely be stopping by tomorrow to check that out!</p><p></p><p>NewSensations.com has been around for decades, and they’ve been cranking out the hits throughout their entire run. The oldest movie in the VOD catalog was released in 2006, so they haven’t made their full collection available, but you’ve still got plenty of options. As of this writing, there are around 860 movies available as Video On Demand. I hope you weren’t planning on getting any work done today.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>But Does It Beat the Membership?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Is NewSensations VOD a better deal than the full membership? Well, it depends entirely on how much you’re planning on beating off to their films. If you like jerking it to a new video every day, you’ll almost certainly save money in the long run with the monthly plan. I’d recommend VOD if you consume less porno generally, or if you already have a membership elsewhere but just really have to see your favorite starlet in her newest New Sensations movie.</p><p></p><p>The prices on vod.NewSensations.com are a little bit unclear until you actually sign up for an account, at which point the exact price tags are revealed. On the front page, it says prices for My Black Hotwife #6 range between $5.95 and $19.95, which is pretty damn broad. Turns out, six bucks is the rental price, or you can own the movie for twenty.</p><p></p><p>A regular monthly membership on the paysite will run you thirty bucks, and that’s an all-you-can fap ticket. If you’re going to rent six or more movies, you’re probably better off just getting a subscription. Speaking as a regular and heavy consumer of online porno, it’s hard to justify a twenty-dollar download of a singular film. Deep-niche fetish porn would be another story since it can be difficult to find, but NewSensations offers pretty standard hardcore fare, albeit some of the best in the industry.</p><p></p><p>For six bucks, though, I could’t resist a recent compilation called Chubby Chicks #2, featuring such well-endowed bimbos as Amilia Onyx, Daisy Gomez and the irresistible Chloe Bang. The rental is good for seven days, so I know exactly what I’m doing this weekend and beyond. If I enjoy it enough, I can buy the movie for $25, but I probably won’t. That’s just too much to pay for a porno in 2024, even if it is a compilation. For a few bucks more, I can just sign up for a NewSensations membership and spend the whole month with my dick in my hand.</p><p></p><p>At the end of the day, I’d recommend a peek at vod.NewSensations.com if you’re already a fan of the site, but perhaps don’t have quite enough in your wallet for a full membership this month. The movies are as fapworthy and pornstar-packed as you expect from New Sensations, with pricetags that just might be less than the full show, depending on what kind of wanker you are. The films do have free preview vids available, so start there and see how excited you get.</p>"}}]

Well, my friends, that’s the entire premise of this next service, who put their gimmick right there in the title. While your friends, neighbors and coworkers might be easily identifiable online by a string of seemingly random numbers, you’ll be enjoying anonymity, privacy, security, and all the other benefits that come with these perks.</p><p></p><p>IPVanish.com claims the crown as “the best VPN,” and while it’s a bold statement, they’ve got a pretty strong reputation. <strong>The company offers a Virtual Private Network service that encrypts your traffic and shields your IP address</strong>, which can come in handy for a number of reasons we’ll get into shortly. The site gets well over a million visits a month and they’ve got a great rating on TrustPilot, but naturally, I wanted to take a peek for myself and see how they measure up to all the competition out there.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>I Think I Know Why You Need a VPN</h3><p></p><p></p><p>In case you’re unfamiliar with the technology, a VPN works by basically sending all of your traffic through an encrypted tunnel. The IP address assigned by your internet service provider tells the whole internet who and where you are, but if you’re using a VPN, all they can see is the VPN’s IP. What’s more, you can choose your own location, making it seem like you ain’t living or internetting somewhere with a pesky censorship issue.</p><p></p><p><strong>IPVanish.com has over 90 VPN locations, more than 2,400 servers and over 40,000 IP addresses around the world</strong>. This kind of massive infrastructure is one of the things I look for in a good VPN service, because it helps ensure you always have plenty of fast, reliable ways to use the service. Some of the bigger sites out there are sometimes able to recognize VPN IP addresses, but the massive spread of them here should help cut down on that. On the same note, IPVanish’s OpenVPN Scramble is designed to combat exactly that type of VPN detection.</p><p></p><p>Another major factor I look for is speed. IPVanish promises optimized streaming speeds. You won’t be shuffling your traffic through some shitty, slow-ass proxy server, but a high-powered VPN capable of 4K video without endless buffering. I don’t normally mention reviews from other sites, but IP Vanish offers up quotes about their speeds from outfits like Tom’s Guide, C-Net and IGN. This shit’s legit, my dudes.</p><p></p><p><strong>IP Vanish works with damn near any device connected to the internet, with lots of dedicated apps</strong>. So, what are you on? Windows? Mac? Tablet? Laptop? TV? You can use this bad boy with your router, your browsers, or whatever. One of notable absences to me was Roku, but I’ve been having issues with their business model ever since they deleted all my porn apps. Maybe I’ll upgrade to a decent smart TV that works with IPVanish…</p><p></p><p></p><h3>All the Perks for Every Member</h3><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Some plans come with a 30-day risk-free guarantee</strong>. I’m a little bummed you don’t get a free trial with the regular monthly membership, especially since it seems to be a relatively common perk if you look around. The yearly and 2-year subscriptions are eligible, which is honestly a good way of coaxing you toward a longer plan.</p><p></p><p>I do like the straightforward, non-tiered pricing scheme. All members get the same benefits, so you don’t have to stare at a chart wondering what you really need and what you should really spend. For example, everyone can connect with unlimited devices and enjoy unlimited bandwidth. These can be a real bottlenecks with some of the other popular VPNs, especially if you’ve got a household full of gadgets and gizmos.</p><p></p><p>Another nice perk for everyone is the no-logs rule. IPVanish.com is focused on privacy, so <strong>they don’t record any of your online activity</strong>. Nobody’s going to come knocking to ask if you looked at a porn site without uploading your ID, no matter what backwoods state you live. For even more protection, they’ve got a built-in kill switch in case your VPN connection is lost. It’ll block out everything until you get safely reconnected.</p><p></p><p>Another really useful feature is built-in Threat Protection. I had to dig into the IPVanish.com website a bit to learn how it works, but it sounds like they’re using a really hefty, constantly updated blacklist to filter out whoever’s serving up ads, tracking your activity, or trying to steal your identity. I always use adblocker plugins for any web browser I’m using, but this could add yet another level of protection, shutting those spammers out before my plugins need to.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>What Else Can I Do with IPVanish?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>IPVanish can also help you unlock content from streaming services that ain’t available in your country due to licensing issues; they promise support for Netflix, ESPN+ and more. VPNs are really popular among the torrent scene, too. Some folks use VPNs to score cheaper prices on digital goods and services by pretending to live in cheaper country, though platforms like Steam have done their best to crack down on the practice.</p><p></p><p>On more of a day-to-day level, I can’t tell you how valuable a VPN can be if you’re just looking for better privacy and security. Forget about watching blocked porno or Canadian Netflix for a second. Forget about downloading torrents. Do you know how many sites are tracking you online? There’s a reason your ads are targeted, and those are from the “reputable” trackers like Google. If you’re connecting to public wi-fi at the coffee shop without a VPN, you’re playing with fire, my dudes, even if you’re just checking your email.</p><p></p><p>IPVanish.com has the major features I look for in a good VPN, like an expansive global network, no logs, fast speeds and support for a wide range of internet-connected doodads. To me, their standout features are the unmetered devices and bandwidth, saving you the trouble of worrying about what’s connected and for how long, as well as those sweet rates on the long subscriptions. Their Threat Detection feature also elevates IP Vanish above some of the more barebones VPNs out there, and bumps up your security even more. They’re only offering that money-back guarantee on the longer plans, but really, what do you have to lose besides all those invisible eyes on the internet?</p>"}},{"id":"4994b46ff607","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"4994b46ff607","title":"Hide.me","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"Hide.Me provides a VPN service that supports all mainstream devices.

That’s a phrase I’ve used a few times after getting chased out of the local coffee shop by the police. Interestingly, I’ve also used the same phrase while getting some work done in that very same coffee shop. Maybe you’ve been in a similar situation: you’re trying to watch an anal sex orgy on the Internet, but your traffic is being monitored and blocked by the baristas, the boss, the government or your mom. (I’m telling you, dude, it’s time to move out!)</p><p></p><p><strong>Hide.Me claims to be the World’s Fastest VPN</strong>. If you’ve ever tried to get around firewalls and content-blocking software using those free proxy sites, you already know damn well how important speed is. If you’re lucky, those free services may be able to pull up a few dirty images after an hour of waiting, but video is out of the fucking question. If Hide.Me ain’t bullshitting; their service will help you view blocked sites, give you a bonus layer of security and privacy, plus the freedom and other perks you expect from a good VPN. Let’s see how well these dudes deliver.</p><p></p><h3>How a VPN Helps You Masturbate</h3><p></p><p></p><p>If you’re just hearing about this service, you may not yet understand what a Virtual Private Network (VPN) is all about or how it works. In simple terms, <strong>they send all your Internet traffic through an encrypted tunnel that gives you extra privacy, security and freedom</strong>. There are other perks, too, which I’ll get to shortly.</p><p></p><p>Most Internet traffic is heavily monitored. Why do you think all the ads you see seem to be targeted directly at you? Your ISP gives you a unique IP address, which websites and apps use to track everything you do. Your ISP themselves may also be tracking you and selling your interests and information to the highest bidder.</p><p></p><p>With your traffic flowing through Hide.Me’s VPN, websites only see the service’s IP address, so they can’t track you. Neither can your ISP, which means they can’t tell the advertising companies how much you love silicone buttholes, boner pills and rimming videos.</p><p></p><p>Since your IP can’t track you, it also means they won’t throttle you for viewing shit they don’t like. Most Internet users don’t even realize their ISP is slowing them down for watching too many streaming videos or using torrent software, but it happens all the time. Hide.Me can help you get what you’re paying Comcast all that money for.</p><p></p><p>Nobody can track you, and Hide Me ain’t going to either. In fact, they have a strict policy of not keeping logs. If you’re the kind of person who worries about leaving a paper trail, whether it’s because you’re masturbating to golden showers cosplay or stealing trade secrets, these fuckers can help you keep your tracks clean.</p><p></p><h3>Security and Freedom for a Few Bucks a Month</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Honestly, most casual masturbators or general Internet users aren’t going to need the VPN router. It’s overkill with a high out-the-door cost when most of you just need the basic plan. If you’re paying by the month, it’s 13 bones a pop. <strong>There’s a 30-day money-back guarantee</strong>, so I recommend trying out the service and springing for a longer membership if you like it. The yearly rate breaks down to $8.32, and they’ve got a two-year plan that breaks down to a fiver and comes with a couple of bonus months.</p><p></p><h3>Unblock Content Around the World</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Hide Me will help you view all kinds of blocked content. I opened this review with the coffee shop example. If you’re on a public WiFi network that blocks content, this VPN will help you access it. It can do the same thing if they’re restricting your access to lesbian fisting movies at the office, or if you’re still jacking off in mom’s basement and she’s got a content blocker.</p><p></p><p>Their VPN can even help you get through government firewalls. I like to talk about using these things for such noble purposes as beating off to felching movies on company time, but it can also help with serious life-or-death shit.</p><p></p><p>Hide Me has 1800 servers in 72 locations throughout the world. Their network is optimized for speed, meaning you’ll automatically connect to the fastest VPN server near you. However, many people use a VPN to pretend they’re browsing the Internet from somewhere else. There are totally valid porn and non-porn reasons for it.</p><p></p><p>Let’s go back to content unblocking for a second. You think I’m talking about porno and government secrets, which I am, but you can also unblock content on sites like Netflix and Amazon. Because of licensing issues, lots of shows and movies are only available in certain countries. Likewise, fans of JAV (Japanese Adult Video) will be able to access Japan-only porn by pretending to browse from Japan.</p><p></p><p>You can also use Hide Me to score discounts via the magic of International pricing. Some of you nerdier fuckers will recall the recent controversy about people saving money on Steam by purchasing games from another country. Have you ever considered signing up for a premium porn site while browsing from a third-world country?</p><p></p><h3>And They’ve Got a Free Version, Too</h3><p></p><p></p><p>You can move an unlimited amount of data on the premium plan, but free users only get 10 gigs per month. Depending on how many 4K teen blowjobs you watch, that may be all you need. The premium plan lets you connect 10 devices simultaneously, while the free plan only gives you one. Again, this may be enough for the casual masturbator.</p><p></p><p>A bigger limitation is the number of locations you have access to as a free user. As mentioned, Hide Me’s got a couple of thousand servers in 72 locations. Free users only have access to 5 of them. In addition, free users lose out on dynamic port forwarding and fixed IP addresses. With all these limitations, you may not necessarily get the full benefits of everything I’ve already described here, but it doesn’t hurt to try.</p><p></p><p>I always tell people to take advantage of any VPN’s trial period, but Hide.Me’s free plan provides an even easier way to see what they have to offer without having to risk any of your precious, hard-earned money. You could even do the free plan then try a risk-free month of their premium one. Given their overall satisfaction rate with their VPN, I doubt you’ll be disappointed.</p>"}},{"id":"3ce84d3f5478","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"3ce84d3f5478","title":"Planet VPN","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"FreeVPNPlanet.com offers virtual private networks and their free tier is really free without registration to improve security unlocking content fast","canonical":"https://theporndude.com/zh/13111/planetvpn","affiliate_url":"https://freeplanetvpn.com/?btag=a1718-b1-p0-cJP-u90436932001758702343&campaign=1&a_aid=1718&serial=freevpnplanet.com--English&referrer=a1718-b1-p0-cJP-u90436932001758702343","rating":4,"siteOrder":31,"price":"free","tags":["免费"],"features":[],"categories":[{"id":"best-vpn-sites","collection":"categories_en"}],"screenshot_url":"https://cdn.staticstack.net/assets/img/r-thumbs/e06e4_planetvpn_small.jpg","image_alt":"Planet VPN, the best VPN website","scraped_at":"2025-10-28T21:53:59.806Z","iconSpritesheet":"custom-favicon-spritesheet.png","iconPosition":"-112px -656px","iconClassName":"ctm-icon13111","logoIconClass":"icon13111","pros":["freemium virtual private network","increased security and privacy on the web","works with damn near everything","free tier is legit free, no registration required","unlock blocked content","browse from anywhere in the world","30-day guarantee"],"cons":["free tier is ad supported"],"detailedDescription":"<p>Free VPN Planet has a name that implies something truly grand. You’re telling me there’s a whole planet full of Virtual Private Networks that don’t require payment? I’m not sure how the economies and ecosystems of such a heavenly body would work, but it’s a vaguely interesting concept for the Asimovs, Bradburys and Clarkes of the world to explore. Me? I’d probably just use it for watching porn on the public WiFi at my local coffee shop.</p><p></p><p>If you’re at all familiar with the technology, you knew what FreeVPNPlanet.com was hawking the moment you saw the title: <strong>it’s a virtual private network service with free features</strong>. The question, of course, is whether or not the service is really as free as they claim. It seems like a stretch, and I was a bit skeptical that a free VPN could work as well as the paid options out there. They’ve been around for a few years, though, with a website that gets tens of thousands of visitors per day. That’s no small feat, so it only increased my curiosity. Let me tell you what I found inside.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>A Whole Planet of Free VPNs</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Since you’re reading this review, I have to assume you have a basic understanding of how a Virtual Private Network works. This ain’t a tech site and I’m not going to get into the deep nerdy elements, but I usually describe a VPN as a private tunnel between you and the rest of the internet. Your personal web traffic is encrypted as it flows through that tunnel, making it impossible for all those unseen eyes to see what you’re up to.</p><p></p><p>Do you see what I’m getting at? One of the biggest reasons for using a VPN like Free VPN Planet is that <strong>it increases your security and privacy on the web</strong>. I won’t use a public WiFi network without one, but it’s also a valuable asset on your own home network. I’ll get into some of the other perks, but privacy and security are the #1 reasons I slip that digital condom over my machinery. As with other VPN services, these guys don’t keep logs, conveniently covering your tracks as soon as you make them.</p><p></p><p>You can use it with basically everything, too. FreeVPNPlanet.com is compatible with just about anything that connects to the net. It works with Android and iOS mobile devices, Windows, Mac and Linux boxes, as well as any of the commonly used web browsers out there. Unless you’re using some weird, off-brand shit your geeky cousin built and coded from the ground up, you should be golden.</p><p></p><p>I know you guys are here because you want the opinion of the world’s most respected pornography connoisseur and professional masturbator. I appreciate that and I’ll give you what you want, but in case there’s any question about the accuracy of my review, check out those user ratings out on FreeVPNPlanet.com’s front page. Most of their rankings on sites like TrustPilot, Google Play and AppStore hover around 4.7 to 4.9 stars! I clearly ain’t the only one singing their praises…</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Putting the Free in Free VPN Planet</h3><p></p><p></p><p>No shit, my dudes: <strong>Free VPN Planet’s free tier is legitimately free</strong>. I didn’t even have to register an account to get it working. If you’ve ever signed up for any freebies online, you know how unusual this setup is. I feel like I’m always entering my credit card digits whenever something is “free”, and then getting charged when I forget to cancel the trial. That ain’t happening here, because this ain’t a trial.</p><p></p><p>There are limits, of course, but they’re probably not what you’re expecting. Hell, some of the paid VPNs out there have cheap tiers that aren’t even as good as this. FreeVPNPlanet gives free users access to servers in 5 countries, with no limits on traffic, bandwidth or time. Honestly, that’s going to be powerful enough for a lot of users. If you’re not currently using any VPN, it’s obviously a step up, but I think the service stands on its own even against the competition.</p><p></p><p>Premium membership is ten bucks a month, though the yearly rate breaks down to a small fraction of that. Do you need it, though? I’d say it depends on what you’re doing with your VPN, as many features are the same between membership tiers. The free version does give you access to 5 fast servers, but you only get maximum speed if you pay for it, plus access to over 1260 servers in 60 countries. Premium members also get dedicated servers for things like P2P, gaming and streaming, support for routers, better tech support and the ability to connect with 10 devices at once.</p><p></p><p>The free tier of FreeVPNPlanet is also supported with ads, which go away when go premium. It’s worth mentioning that ads are very light. This ain’t at all like closing pop-up windows while you’re trying to beat off to a free tube. In fact, I was connected to my free VPN for most of the time I’ve been writing this review, and I haven’t seen any ads at all. Your mileage may vary, but this is not a spammy service.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Why Else Would You Use Free VPN Planet?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>It goes beyond hiding from the usual advertisers, though. Depending on where you live and where you’re browsing from, <strong>FreeVPNPlanet can unlock content that’s normally blocked for you</strong>. You usually hear about people using a VPN to access Netflix or Disney+ shows unavailable in your region, but the same technology will let you browse porn from work or in a country with a Great Firewall. You know who I’m talking about.</p><p></p><p>Since a VPN can make it look like you’re browsing from anywhere in the world, you can also take advantage of global economics. Prices for digital goods and services are often significantly cheaper in some countries than others, and that includes a few porn paysite memberships. I’ve also heard about people scoring ridiculous deals on Steam games by pretending they live in India.</p><p></p><p>Given the fact that FreeVPNPlanet really does have a full free membership tier, I wasn’t really expecting the usual guarantees you find on most VPN sites. Maybe that was just cynicism on my end, because I was totally wrong. As elsewhere, <strong>Free VPN Planet offers a 30-day money-back guarantee</strong>, making the Premium membership almost as risk-free as the free version. What more could you ask for?</p><p></p><p>Going into FreeVPNPlanet.com, I was skeptical about what I’d find. The name alone sounded too good to be true, but holy shit, these guys surprised me in every way. It’s no wonder they have such high ratings on every trust-ranking website out there. They’ve got everything you could want in a VPN, without any of the sketchy shit that you sometimes get with the shadier outfits. The free tier is very limited compared to the premium one, but it still provides most of what the average VPN user needs. There’s no registration required to try it out, so I recommend giving it a shot. What have you got to lose, besides all those prying eyes that have been following you around the web?</p>"}},{"id":"e19e84acf75e","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"e19e84acf75e","title":"SafeShell VPN","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"SafeShellVPN.com Routing your data with 10K high-speed servers worldwide to improve security Unlock blocked content Skip age verification","canonical":"https://theporndude.com/zh/23404/safeshellvpn-website-review","affiliate_url":"https://www.safeshellvpn.com/feature6/?irclickid=20ERX5RosxycUhOz45TpeUOJUkp1v82U8RNI3E0&sharedid=&user_source=affiliate&user_promotion=impact3786350&user_content=2845433&utm_source=affiliate&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=impact3786350&irgwc=1","rating":4,"siteOrder":32,"price":"free","tags":[],"features":[],"categories":[{"id":"best-vpn-sites","collection":"categories_en"}],"screenshot_url":"https://cdn.staticstack.net/assets/img/r-thumbs/9b447_safeshellvpn-website-review_small.jpg","image_alt":"SafeShell VPN, the best VPN website","scraped_at":"2025-10-28T21:54:05.198Z","iconSpritesheet":"custom-favicon-spritesheet.png","iconPosition":"-256px -976px","iconClassName":"ctm-icon23404","logoIconClass":"icon23404","pros":["high-quality vpn service","unlock blocked content, including porn","over 10,000 server nodes around the world, optimized for speed and streaming","free trial","works with any platform","connect with different vpn servers at the same time","subtitle translation","no logs policy","built-in adblock"],"cons":["free trial requires signup"],"detailedDescription":"<p>I’ve been talking about Virtual Private Networks like SafeShell VPN for years here at MissAVDH. Besides boosting your security when you’re using the internet on a shared network, they offer perks like letting you check out blocked content and scoring international discounts on online services. Still, they’ve been kind of a niche thing, largely limited to computer geeks, the paranoid, and users living under repressive regimes. As age verification has become a fact of life around the US, the UK and other parts of the world, though, more consumers are worried about getting their identities stolen by sketchy companies and even sketchier cybercriminals. A good VPN is both the easiest and arguably the best way around that, not that I recommend you breaking the law!</p><p></p><p>Which is why we’re here today. <strong>SafeShellVPN.com offers a high-quality VPN service</strong>, which they’re claiming is the best in the business when it comes to TV, movies, sports and social media. Considering where you’re reading this, I bet you’ve got pervier uses in mind, and well, so do I. The website gets about a hundred thousand visitors a month, but that ain’t even counting the subscribers who are already using the thing on a month-to-month basis. Come along with me as I take a little tour and see how they differ from the other VPNs on the market.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Skip the Mandatory IDs and Facial Scans</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Pornhub was the first major porn site to start blocking visitors from US states with age verification laws. As those laws have spread and become more stringent, though, I’ve been seeing more and more adult platforms following their lead. The UK just implemented a similar law, so hello to all my friends reading this from across the pond. Those of you who ain’t straight-up blocked from a lot of porn sites now have to verify your age through sketchy third-party companies who want your ID or a live video of your face.</p><p></p><p>I’m not against the idea of keeping porn away from the youngsters, but man, violating our privacy ain’t the way to do it! One of SafeShellVPN’s most immediate applications for folks like us is letting us bypass those age verification protocols, not that I recommend you to break the law! A Virtual Private Network works by routing your data through a server in another region, so it will look like you’re connecting from somewhere without those stringent, overbearing and intrusive laws.</p><p></p><p>SafeShellVPN.com has over 10,000 server nodes around the world. That means you have a shitload of options when it comes to improving your privacy and unblocking content. Their servers are optimized for speed, so you don’t have to settle for pixelly videos streamed at dialup rates or websites loading at turtle speed. They are focused on streaming media, after all, and that includes dirty movies!</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Free Trials, Low Prices and No Logs</h3><p></p><p></p><p>In any case, <strong>you can score a free trial to test it out</strong>. A lot of VPNs really limit the features for cheapskates, typically with fewer connections allowed, a smaller selection of servers to choose from and a maximum bandwidth allotment. These guys go all out, letting trial users take advantage of everything, but you do have to pony up your credit card digits to take advantage of the freebies. At the end of the trial, the paid subscription starts, just like the premium porn sites that offer trial memberships.</p><p></p><p>Pricing is comparable to pretty much any VPN out there. The monthly rate is about $13 a month, or you can save a bunch of money with the $80 yearly plan. There’s also a weekly membership for six bones, but I’d recommend either of the other subscriptions unless you just love burning through money. I was a little surprised they don’t accept crypto given their commitment to protecting your privacy, but they accept all the other usual methods of payment.</p><p></p><p>Back to the subject of privacy, <strong>they have a strict no logs policy</strong>. They don’t keep any logs of anything and they promise not to share your data with external parties, though I am not a lawyer, and I always wonder how well those policies would hold up to a subpoena.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Exploring the Perks of SafeShellVPN</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Another noteworthy perk you ain’t going to find just anywhere is automatic subtitle translation. I feel like this has limited utility for those of you who are mainly looking to bypass those age verification methods, not that I recommend you breaking the law, but it’s worth mentioning because it’s a rare feature. This will come in handy when you’re watching region-blocked movies on a platform like Apple TV, Max or Hulu, but if I’m being honest, I don’t really read the words when I’m watching foreign porno movies. I’m a little busy, if you catch my drift.</p><p></p><p><strong>SafeShellVPN.com’s SafeNet Adblock also helps you block the ads and trackers that so many websites are using out there on the web</strong>. I’m always using an anti-spam plugin or two with my browser, and I recommend you do the same, but most of you already know they ain’t foolproof. This doubles up your digital condom for another layer of protection, which is really useful for those extra-spammy porn sites out there that seem to throw another pop-up at you with every single click. If you’re still having issues with that shit, I’ve always got recommendations for porn sites in any category with more user-friendly experiences.</p><p></p><p>I know most of you are reading this review because of those age verification laws, which have caused an absolutely massive spike in interest for apps like SafeShellVPN. As always, I do not recommend anybody to use a VPN to break the laws of their country! Still, you should be aware of some of the other things it’s capable of. Personally, I like to use it to get cheaper rates on things like online subscriptions and digital purchases. If a platform is offering cheaper prices in another country, you can use SafeShell VPN to make it look like you’re connecting from that region, potentially saving you a pretty penny.</p><p></p><p>There’s also just the general security and privacy it provides. You’re much safer connecting to the coffee shop WiFi to check your email if you’re using SafeShell VPN, and I usually turn it on even if I’m just surfing the web at a buddy’s house. I don’t need anybody snooping on my internet usage and checking out what I’m doing. The service even keeps your ISP out of your hair. I’m pretty sure those sneaky bastards at Comcast start throttling your connection if they know you’re using p2p file sharing or anything else they’re not thrilled about.</p><p></p><p>At the end of the day, SafeShellVPN.com offers everything you could want in a good Virtual Private Network, as well as some rare perks you’re not going to get from other services on the market. I like the App Mode, which lets you connect to multiple VPN servers at once, and the baked-in adblock will certainly come in handy for almost any internet user. Even if you’re just using it to skip age verification and unlock content, it’s easily worth the few bucks a month it costs. Your privacy and peace of mind deserve it, my friends. Also, keep in mind that you can only use a VPN, if it's legal in your country and you cannot use it to break any laws!</p>"}},{"id":"43e257047382","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"43e257047382","title":"SaviourVPN","lang":"en","date":"2025-09-22T00:00:00.000Z","description":"SaviourVPN.com is a VPN platform that provides all services from secure browsing to over 3,000 servers.

Shit, you’re reading this on the internet right now! What do you really know about using a Virtual Private Network to unblock content and keep your computer safe? The fact that you’re even reading this page tells me you might know a little more than the average joe, but perhaps you ain’t quite sure which VPN is right for you. It’s a crowded market already, with more and more VPN Sites popping up with different offers and vaguely different services.</p><p></p><p>My whole reason for starting MissAVDH was because Google doesn’t quite know a good anal site from a shitty one, or a hopping amateur forum from an internet ghost town with one old guy posting dick pics. Sometimes it just pays off to find someone who’s done their homework on the subject, rather than some computer-generated list. The folks behind VPNSites.com had a similar idea, although it’s less directly related to jacking off. They rank and review different VPN sites, making it easier to find the one that’s right for you. I’m pretty much always using a VPN, and I’m not averse to switching when I find a better deal or superior service, so I decided to take a little tour of the joint.</p><p></p><h3>Talking About the Top VPN Sites</h3><p></p><p></p><p>One of the major differences between VPNSites and MissAVDH’s VPN section is just the scale of it. My site is mainly devoted to porno, while theirs is devoted entirely to Virtual Private Networks. My list currently features 8 VPNs that I felt make the grade, while they rank at least 30 of the top VPN sites. Considering it’s a growing market, I expect that number to grow as well.</p><p></p><p>I like how the site is set up for instant accessibility, like any good list site should be. Those of you in a hurry can just pick the number one slot and call it a day, just like you’d do at MissAVDH if you’re in a blued-balled rush to get to the free Latina porn or best BBW site. One of the very first things you’ll see on VPNSites.com is a big table laying out the perks and benefits of each of their ranked VPNs. What a coincidence—they’ve got NordVPN ranked as #1, and it's the one I’m using right now. <strong>VPN Sites are ranked based on features, security, speed, ease of use, availability and pricing</strong>.</p><p></p><p>It's a nicely detailed table that spells out a lot of the details of each VPN without having to dig into the full review. They list the privacy level, speed, available platforms, numbers of servers and locations, plus details like which services are unblocked, user usability, and torrent friendliness. Pricing is also included, with neat little icons letting you know if a free trial is available.</p><p></p><p>If I have any complaint about the VPNSites table, it’s that it’s so detailed you’ll have to do some horizontal scrolling to see everything. That said, I can’t think of a better way to lay out all that info so cleanly and conveniently. They’ve included enough data points that most users won’t really have to dig into the longer reviews trying to figure out the precise deets.</p><p></p><h3>What Kind of VPN Are You Looking For?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Scroll down past that master table out on the front page and you’ll see the smaller lists. They’ve got rankings of the Best VPNs for the USA, the optimal ones for multiple devices, your best options for streaming, gaming or torrents, and the best VPNs by platform, whether you’re on iPhone, Android, Windows or Mac. There’s even a section listing the best Free VPNs, just in case mom is refusing allowance until you clean all the jizz socks off the basement floor, you filthy animal.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, they’ve used slightly different criteria for ranking the smaller lists. For example, the best VPN options for gaming are going to be the ones with the lowest latency, and the best VPNs for Americans are going to be the ones with the most servers in the USA. They also take into account user rankings for the different categories.</p><p></p><p>I like that they’ve included the Best VPNs by Reddit, just in case you don’t trust VPNSites’s rankings. For what it’s worth, 3 out of 5 of their top VPNs are also on Reddit’s list. Same as me, they ain’t claiming to be the final word on the subject, just an educated one. Personal preferences are always going to vary a bit, whether you’re choosing a hentai tube or a service that helps you watch hentai sites at work.</p><p></p><h3>Are You Still Masturbating Without a VPN?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>VPNSites.com goes into a lot more technical detail about how it all works and what the benefits are. <strong>They’ve also included a hell of a FAQ that will help newbies and even experienced VPN users get the most out of the available services</strong>. The very first question is “How do I select the right VPN?” The answer breaks down all the most important factors, like log and privacy policies, simultaneous connections, cross-platform support and server distribution, explaining why each is important.</p><p></p><p>The VPNSites FAQ covers everything from the basics, like “How do I turn off my VPN?” and “How to set up VPN on Windows 10” to more esoteric concerns like “What is onion over VPN?” and “What dedicated hardware device aggregates hundreds or thousands of VPN connections?” Whether you’re curious about Kill Switches, VPN legality, or how to work VPN magic with Netflix, they’ve got you covered.</p><p></p><p>I know I’m always tooting my horn about how great MissAVDH is, but I’ve got to hand it to these guys: they’ve got me beat when it comes to ranking and reviewing the best VPN Sites on the internet. That shouldn’t come as any huge surprise, given the focus of my site and the focus of theirs, but it kind of makes me wonder if I need to step up my game a little. Then again, I’m pretty busy fap-testing porn sites, playing adult video games for BestPornGames, and banging actual pornstars over at MissAVDHCasting. Perhaps it’s best to let professionals do what they do best.</p><p></p><p>VPNSites.com is worth a look if you’ve checked out my own list of VPNs and ain’t quite convinced yet. VPNSites offers a detailed breakdown of the services offered by all the major VPNs operating right now, ranking them by all the essential features and explaining why they’re so important. I recommend using a VPN on any public network even if you ain’t watching anything dirty, and they’ve got a lot of other features daily internet users will appreciate. If you haven’t found the right one for you just yet, this site’s a good place to start.</p>"}}]

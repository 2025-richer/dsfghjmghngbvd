If you’ve ever stroked the pole while reading dirty stories online, you’re probably already familiar with Literotica. The site has been around for 20 years now and gets well over 50 million views a month. It’s the king daddy motherload of written porno.</p><p></p><p>The site has hundreds of thousands of stories, poems, and pictures, all submitted by Literotica users. This active and horny community has been key to the site’s longevity and popularity.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Twenty Years of Perving Out</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Downloading a cumshot pic over dial-up took a few minutes of waiting. No wonder the sex story forums were hopping. Pretty much every category of perversion spawned its own camp of deviates banging out stories.</p><p></p><p>The problem with Usenet was that it wasn’t as user-friendly as the World Wide Web that was getting so popular with your parents. You needed software other than a web browser to make the most of it. As more people used the web, less used Usenet.</p><p></p><p>If Usenet wasn’t dead by November 1998 when Literotica opened its doors, the site put the nails in the coffin. Here was a massive, worldwide community of readers and writers of erotic fiction, connected through the simplicity of the web. Access to the growing collection of naughty words was easier than ever before. I was 18 years old and just got access to dial-up internet. I bet most of you spoiled fuckers will never understand the pain of downloading a picture or video back in those days and no wonder that sites like this quickly gained popularity, because it was either this or waiting for 30 minutes to see some naked chicks. Alright, I admit, sniffing your stepsister's dirty panties was another option. ;)</p><p></p><p>The founders of Literotica have said they registered the domain and then pretty much came along for the ride. They give the site’s users full credit for turning it into the masturbatory funhouse we know and love.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Literary Naughty Bits</h3><p></p><p></p><p>The main page is broken down into categories. The community section gives you access to the bustling Bulletin Board and Live Chat. There’s also a weekly advice column called Ask Aspasia and Fern, as well as Author Awards and Literotica Personals.</p><p></p><p>Next up is resources. Here you’ll find a site FAQ, Volunteer Editors and Writer’s Resources. This is also where you’ll submit your own material.</p><p></p><p>Beneath Resources is Stores. Literotica has managed to stay free for two decades, but they’ve got to support themselves somehow. Bandwidth for 50+ million views a month ain’t cheap. Buy some dildos, video on demand, or the Literotica print anthology to support the site.</p><p></p><p>Honestly, most users are going to scroll past these sections, down to the really good stuff: the Erotic Stories. Broken up into around 50 subcategories including poetry and illustrations, these links into Literotica’s catalog make up the bulk of the page.</p><p></p><p>Beneath the stories are some recent Adult Headline News stories. Right now, it’s some newsflashes about Bill Cosby’s sex trial and some girl having sex with 25 boys in the bathroom.</p><p></p><p>Finally, at the bottom of the page, we’ve got links to Literotica’s Erotica Audio and Erotic Images sub-sections.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>About Those Stories</h3><p></p><p></p><p>There’s a lot of overlap between the categories on a regular porn site and the categories on Literotica. You’ve got the standards like Anal, Group Sex, Lesbian Sex, and Mature, for starters.</p><p></p><p>There are also genres you’d expect from kinkier hardcore sites, like BDSM, Taboo, Fetish and Exhibitionist.</p><p></p><p>Erotic Horror seems a little odd until you remember that Literotica is where porn means fiction. The same goes for Sci-Fi and Fantasy, which has a lot of overlap on the site with Non-Human.</p><p></p><p>The list doesn’t get as deeply weird as on a hentai site, but it’s unusual if you’re used to beating your meat to moving pictures. What gives?</p><p></p><p>Literotica, just like <a href=\"https://MissAVDH.com/258/asstr\" target=\"_blank\">ASSTR</a>, has a high proportion of female users compared to most sex sites. That probably does a lot to shape the collection, as does the fact that written smut is just different from the picture kind. We don’t need a redhead section if we can just imagine they’re all redheads.</p><p></p><p>They even have a special name for members of the message boards, which goes by \"Literoticans\", \"Litizens\" or \"Litsters\", who arrange events known as \"Litogethers\", where you can meet each other in real life and socialize. Since these websites are mostly popular among females, this could be your chance to meet a fucked-up bitch just like yourself and fuck some real pussy! Don't forget to use a condom, unless you like to pay child support for the next 18 years. ;)</p><p></p><p>Just because there are lots of women producing material doesn’t mean the site is full of feminist, #metoo porn. I’m not even sure what that would entail. A search of the story archive for “metoo” brings up 45 stories with titles like Nude Day Family Celebration Chapter 01, My Whipping Chapter 03, and The Big Bootied Latina And Her Gigolo Chapter 01.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Let’s Get In There</h3><p></p><p></p><p>The top of the page shows the newest stories in the category. Holy fucking shit, no fewer than 24 taboo stories have been posted in the last 24 hours. They’ve got titles like A Mother’s Lust and She Helps with Daughter’s Husband.</p><p></p><p>Below the New Taboo Stories are Random Taboo Stories, pulled randomly from their collection. A “Spin!” button lets you grab a fresh set. That’s a great feature to have when you’re fucking with a big collection like this.</p><p></p><p>Below those is the Taboo Hall of Fame. These are the highest-rated, most loved, and most talked-about stories in the category.</p><p></p><p>You’ll notice when you’re browsing that a lot of stories are part of a series. There Goes the Neighborhood Chapter 05; Keep It in the Family Part 08; A Horny Woman Chapter 03: A Night Out.</p><p></p><p>If you find a series or even just a story you like, the easiest way to get more of the same is to click the author’s name under the title. It would be convenient if they put links to other chapters/episodes in the one you’re reading, but the new Story Series section of the site can help with that.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Share Your Filthy Fantasies</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Literotica’s only rules are no pedophilia and no bestiality. That’s standard on every porn site. Unlike most other sites, though, Literotica allows taboo and non-consensual sex. I know that 50 % of you sex depraved fuckers now skipped to the next site review in this category, since this was exactly what you were looking for isn't it? Anyways, the other 50 % of you sick fucks still reading, I can assure you that there's plenty of material about taboo fantasies! \"Keeping it in the family\", as Kay Parker would say. ;)</p><p></p><p>My first encounter with Literotica came after I let this broad I was smashing use my computer. She forgot to log out of the site, so I found out she wrote a lot of really rough daddy/daughter scenes and she also fapped to that <a href=\"https://MissAVDH.com/3455/bellesa\" target=\"_blank\">Bellesa</a> website. I bought handcuffs and a thick leather belt later that day.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Dirty Pictures and Poems</h3><p></p><p></p><p>The Illustrated section of Stories has stories with a handful of drawings or photos. They’re not really photosets. There are some titties if you really dig deep, but a lot of them are stories written around stock photos of women.</p><p></p><p>Literotica’s Adult Comics and Erotic Art sections are okay detours if you’re already on the site, but they’re not really a selling point. If you’re after that kind of material, you’re better off pointing your dick at a hentai site that specializes in it.</p><p></p><p>The poetry section has a few new pieces a day, but I couldn’t tell you much about the quality of the stuff. I like huge titties and tight cunts stretched out by monster cocks. I get lost when you replace those with metaphors about rainbows and shit.</p><p></p><p>If you’re looking for literary erotica to get the blood pumping to your cock, Literotica (often misspelled as \"litrotica\", \"lirotica\", \"literotca\", \"litterotica\", \"literoitca\", \"literocia\" and \"literatica\") is absolutely the first place I’d look. They’ve been around since the very beginning of the game, and the site is still the biggest collection of written smut in the world. Go check it out if you haven’t yet.</p>"}},{"id":"e8311cc3a068","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"e8311cc3a068","title":"Nifty Stories","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"Nifty.org is a porn novel site Nifty collection of porn novels all about gay lesbian bisexual and transgender content There are no straight content here If you like to read text and porn novels then you should know...","canonical":"https://theporndude.com/zh/251/nifty","affiliate_url":"https://www.nifty.org/nifty/","rating":4,"siteOrder":15,"price":"free","tags":[],"features":[],"categories":[{"id":"best-erotic-stories-sites","collection":"categories_en"}],"screenshot_url":"https://cdn.staticstack.net/assets/img/r-thumbs/6c7e0_Nifty_small.jpg","image_alt":"Nifty Stories, porn story site","scraped_at":"2025-10-28T21:57:05.335Z","iconSpritesheet":"favicon-spritesheet.png","iconPosition":"-240px -96px","iconClassName":"icon251","logoIconClass":"icon251","pros":["the stories are well written","the shop is well equipped","huge archive of stories","an active, engaged community","donation-based model"],"cons":["a shitty online reading experience","lack of community features","a couple contests couldn’t hurt"],"detailedDescription":"<p>Nifty Erotic Stories Archive! Erotic literature is the oldest form of smut known to man. It was porn before porn was invented. Dating back to the days of Ancient Greece, epic erotic poems were primarily how people used to get their fap on. Well, in between having gay butt sex with one another, of course (look it up, it was a totally common activity in Ancient Greece).</p><p></p><p>Erotic lit has survived throughout the ages, though, and is still a popular form of smut even in today’s day and age. That’s right, believe it or not, even with billions upon billions of videos of the world’s hottest women getting fucked in any and every way imaginable at our instant disposal with nothing more than the click of a mouse, some people still prefer to read their porn.</p><p></p><p>And I must say, I admire their dedication to literature. I mean, I’m a writer by profession and I don’t even read erotic lit to get off. I would put money on the majority of erotic lit readers being women or gay, though. I just don’t see straight men fapping to flowery language sans something to visually help them out. What can I say? We’re a bunch of uncultured swine, it’s true.</p><p></p><p>I can definitely see the appeal to erotic lit, though. There is something sensual about really good writing. I’ve even read books and stories that have made me hard before (upon which I, of course, promptly set the book down, opened up Porn Hub, and fapped myself to fruition). But reading something to orgasm? I don’t know. I just don’t see it happening for me. But, hey, I’m open-minded, maybe I’ll give it a shot some time.</p><p></p><p>There are hundreds of sites and resources for the more sapiosexual leaning, literarily-minded horndogs out there to choose from. Many of which have a sort of forum-style, community-oriented feel to them. Many of which allow their users to submit and publish their own work. Not many of which, however, have been around for as long as Nifty.org. Nor have many (if any) acquired the same level of respect or academic consideration.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Longevity, Community, Productivity</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Not only is the site an absolute behemoth, but it is designed well (for an erotic lit site). I don’t know what it is, but erotic lit website designers seem to have a lot of trouble creating an enjoyable, easy to use, aesthetically pleasing online experience. So many similar sites that I’ve been to are just awful to look at and even harder to navigate. I don’t hate Nifty’s design, though.</p><p></p><p>I mean, could it be better? Definitely. But it is far from the worst erotic lit site design I’ve ever seen. It’s simple … a little dated in its wallpaper-style background and blue hyperlinked text, sure, but not horrible.</p><p></p><p>Just underneath the banner on the home page, you will find four boxes to choose from, all of which contain selected new stories, broken into sections by sexual orientation and identity: Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, and Transgender. Okay, I’m all for equal representation of sexual identities and shit, but does Nifty have no heterosexual content? I guess we’ll have to see.</p><p></p><p>Below these featured stories is an easy-click button to “Publish a Story.” I like how immediate and convenient Nifty makes it for users to share their work. I always appreciate it when arts community sites like this go out of their way to encourage participation. There’s nothing snooty, elitist, or exclusive about it—how it should be.</p><p></p><p>Below that easy publish button, you’ll find a list of recent Nifty announcements (news regarding the site, new publications, etc.), a place to donate to Nifty, and a list of recent donors. The site operates solely on user donations and it would appear as if they have a pretty active and eager community of users to back it up.</p><p></p><p>Not only can you donate directly through the site, but after taking a look at Nifty’s announcements, it seems like they also organize real-world fundraisers. In other words, if you are looking for a supportive community of fellow erotic lit lovers, Nifty might be just what you need.</p><p></p><p>Giving donations and participating in fundraisers aren’t the only ways for users to support Nifty, though. In the menu bar at the top of the site, you’ll also find a button labeled “Shop.” Clicking here will link you to Nifty’s Café Press site, where you can buy Nifty merch, such as t-shirts, hoodies, polos, coffee mugs, tote bags, even undies. Hey, if you’re a proud writer of erotica, maybe a Nifty t-shirt is just what you need.</p><p></p><p>Also found in the site’s menu bar are links to “Archives” (dropdown: Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgender, Information, Best of Nifty, Journal Entries, and a few featured authors), New Stories, Authors, Donate, and a search bar. Strange that Nifty provides a special featured section for stories about fucking dogs or whatever, but I still have not come across any hetero erotica to enjoy. I guess the straight, white male author truly is dead once and for all.</p><p></p><p>I love that Nifty is completely ad-free. I think the donation model is a great one for a site like this to lean into, and I am beyond happy to see Nifty taking full advantage of that. I fucking despise ads, especially when they are unnecessary, so I applaud the people at Nifty for finding an alternative means of keeping the site up and running for all these years.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Please Update Your Reader, Nifty</h3><p></p><p></p><p>It’s awful. It looks like someone just copied and pasted a .txt file and clicked “publish.” The formatting is far from uniform. It is boring. There are no pages. It’s just sloppy and, frankly, a bit lazy if you ask me, from a site design perspective. This is, however, par for the course when it comes to erotic lit websites. I don’t know why the people who create and moderate these sites can’t put a little more thought into their main event: the erotica.</p><p></p><p>Does nobody value the idea of a pleasant reading experience? Why is it that all of these sites just throw plain text onto a white background and call it a day? There are so many better ways to present text that it just boggles my mind when I see this kind of shit. It looks cheap, amateur, and rushed. I highly recommend that the people of Nifty use some of that donation money to develop a quality e-reader component to the site. It doesn’t even have to be anything fancy, just something other than seemingly randomly formatted text on a white page!</p><p></p><p></p><h3>A Few Updates Could Help, But a Good Site Overall</h3><p></p><p></p><p>I would like to see Nifty invest in a better reader. I also think that providing a way for authors to get feedback, like a comments section on stories, for example, would be awesome too. Us writers are always looking to improve and, so, being able to read feedback from readers of our genre is invaluable. I would just like to see some more effort put into improving and updating the website in general and really embracing that engaged community with an increase in interactive features.</p><p></p><p>All in all, though, you are unlikely to ever run out of reading material on Nifty. It’s an enormous archive of erotic lit for you to get all hot and bothered to. So, sit back, unzip, and enjoy, ya filthy perverts!</p>"}},{"id":"d736243c9a2a","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"d736243c9a2a","title":"Reddit Taboo Stories","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"rIncestReddit is a website that focuses on its user base and the focus of this Reddit subsite is anything related to incest.

Welcome to Reddit, a wonderful place driven by its community, with many hot subreddits you can enjoy and browse for free. I am sure that by itself, Reddit is the place that could satisfy anyone’s desires. However, if you are here, then you are probably interested in the taboo section of Reddit, right? Well, this section is filled with lots and lots of dirty taboo-related posts.</p><p></p><p>I think that the name alone should tell you whether you are interested in what this section has to offer or not, right? I think that Reddit could satisfy anyone’s needs and in case you were looking for a section that is dedicated to dirty taboo-related posts, I am sure that this is the section you are looking for. This place has a lot to offer, and you can check it out whenever.</p><p></p><h3>So, what is this subreddit all about?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Of course, I am not 100% sure whether you will have such content or not since I did not really check the full post, I just glanced over it, and from what I have seen, I think that anyone who is into taboo will benefit from this. To put it in simple terms. The subreddit taboo is for those who are curious about different experiences other users had or would want to post their own experiences.</p><p></p><p>Now everything that is posted here needs to be related to taboo, otherwise, it is not considered as a post under the right thread. Let’s not forget that Reddit itself has a lot of threads to share, and I think that you will love everything they have to offer, with the taboo subreddit having a couple of sections dedicated just to that.</p><p></p><p>For those who are looking for actual porn dedicated to taboo, should check out the subreddit section titled TabooPorn. Those who would like to hear about relationships or whatever can check out the taboo_relationships, and so on. As you can see, it all depends on what kind of taboo content you were looking for.</p><p></p><p>Here, you will mostly get actual happenings, consultations of sorts, advice and so on. What you should do in each situation or people who just love to share their dirty stories can do so. I guess this is a section for everything related to taboo but without actual content… I guess that is the best way I can explain what this section of Reddit has to offer.</p><p></p><h3>A lot of interesting stories.</h3><p></p><p></p><p>For example, there was a story where the dude shared a secret relationship that he had with his stepsister, and how they hid it from their parents. There were actually a lot of stories where they explained how their relationship functioned and how they were able to hide that from their parents… so I think that this is something you will surely be interested in.</p><p></p><p>Now, those who are not at all interested in taboo, in any shape or form, I am not sure why you would actually click on this thread. Of course, you have to be 18+ to check out what they have to offer, and the people who are featured in these stories should also not be less than 18. I think that this should be a given, but for the idiots out there, I just clarified.</p><p></p><p>As you start browsing you will see that they pretty much-covered everything there is to be covered when talking about porn since that is what this section is all about. Whether you want to actually stay and browse to see whether they will satisfy your needs or not is a whole new story. But, I imagine that people who are here to satisfy their needs should visit the pornographic section of taboo on Reddit.</p><p></p><p>A couple of other posts that I can mention is one where the dude explained how sex with his cousin was the best one, he ever had, others explained the overall relationship how it functions, how they feel about it and so on. I think you already get the gist of what I mean, so there is not much else for me to say. Either visit the site if you are interested or don’t, simple.</p><p></p><h3>Follow the rules.</h3><p></p><p></p><p>If you want to add a tag to your title, you should view the tagging guidelines. They have a special page for that too. Now, there is a rule for the members to not ask for proof, videos, private messages, pictures, or identifying details, which again is pretty obvious and to be expected. I mean, nobody here owes you anything, either read or don’t.</p><p></p><p>You should also not post and report all the abuse or offending posts, which includes all the fake bullshit calling from people who are just commenting. I think you get the gist. Now, you should not post porn or serious posts about relationships, as they belong to other sections. I think it would be best if you take your time and check out the rules yourself.</p><p></p><p>As you can see, Reddit is trying to make its site very trustworthy and stay alive in today’s society, so it is better to check out the rules so you know what you can and cannot post. If you post some bullshit that was specifically said that is not allowed, you will be banned. Of course, there will be a couple of warnings, but at the end of the day, you should not be a dick.</p><p></p><h3>Reddit has something for everyone.</h3><p></p><p></p><p>As you browse through, make sure to check out the homepage of Reddit as well, since there are lots of sections I am sure that you will be interested in. Now, for those who want some special treatment, you should know that you are allowed to become a member of Reddit as well. This is a free site, so the registration will also be pretty free and simple. Once you are a member you can comment on any post, or simply post your own shit. You are also allowed to send private messages to other users.</p><p></p><p>Overall, I think that Reddit by itself is an amazing place that everyone will love. The taboo section of Reddit is exactly what you would expect it to be, and make sure to know about other taboo sections as well. No matter what you might be looking for, I am pretty sure that Reddit will satisfy your dirty needs.</p><p></p><p>Those who are into taboo love to read stories and whatever the heck, are more than welcome to explore this particular section of Reddit. Check out everything the Taboo subreddit has to offer, read the rules and follow the guidelines for posting. Do whatever makes you happy, just make sure that you follow the rules! There are lots of taboo-related subreddits, and this section is one of the best ones!</p>"}},{"id":"3d00b6a2b7dc","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"3d00b6a2b7dc","title":"XNXX Sex Stories","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"SexStories.com Everyone who can find happiness and pleasure while reading pornographic novels should visit XNXX Stories.

However, I have a couple of issues with this site, so if you are interested in erotic stories that you can read for free, just continue reading. This site ain’t all that bad, and I will not sugarcoat anything, do not worry.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Quite a crappy layout…</h3><p></p><p></p><p>They literally have an eye-irritating blue background and yellow and white font color, and everything looks like shit. I just can’t get over the fact that people are still so fucking stupid and lazy… do you lads not know that you can literally hire an amateur to make you a better site than how Sex Stories actually looks like?</p><p></p><p>I’d say that a woman was probably behind this site, for two reasons; first of all, the site looks like shit and we have already established that, but it also feels like the admin is the one who created the website, and we all know that women are always trying to prove themselves… So, my guess is that a chick wanted to be “original” or whatnot, so she decided to make such crap…</p><p></p><p>Another thing that might indicate that a woman was behind this place is that they offer erotic stories, and I do not know about you, but I could never really cum from reading a fucking story… Personally, I believe that stories are for pansies, but at the same time I am not here to judge anyone, I am simply here to tell you everything you need to know about this site and that’s that.</p><p></p><p>On the other hand, this place was designed by XNXX.com, and if you visit their sites, you will see just how much they like that blueish design, which kind of explains why this place also looks crappy. Anyhow, I am pretty sure you are not here to listen to me gibber gabber about the design and that crap since most of you do not give a shit about the site’s design. Well, I shall now focus on the features and content.</p><p></p><p>If you are still confused as to what the fuck this site is all about, do not worry as they offer a good introduction at the beginning of the site. They state all the important shit on top, so just read that. However, I think this shit should be very obvious… I just do not know what one could possibly not understand here.</p><p></p><p>On a positive note, they do offer an option to switch from the shitty blue XnXX blue layout to the actual solid black and white background, which saved my eyes. It took me some time to actually notice this feature, but I am so fucking happy that I did since I would have gone blind by now.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Different categories and a variety of stories</h3><p></p><p></p><p>I honestly thought that this shit would be much easier to read once you open the story, but seriously though, their design is making my eyes bleed. No, I am not being overly dramatic, and you will understand what the fuck I mean when you actually visit the site. With that said, their stories are not half bad, and that is coming from a dude who hates reading shitty stories.</p><p></p><p>Of course, all of the content is erotic, so you will not find any crappy erotic stories that do not have any action. However, these are all amateur-written stories, so do not expect too much when it comes to grammar, order or any of that professional crap. Reading what amateurs wrote is sometimes much more satisfying because you can actually understand everything the ‘writer’ wanted to imply.</p><p></p><p>On the side of the site, you will have all the categories written, and there is quite a lot of them. They cover all the basics, but there were also some weirder categories, such as body modification, alien, and so on. If you are interested, check it out yourself, everything is free.</p><p></p><p>All the categories are connected to the stories, and by the number they offer on the side, I can safely say that this site has a shit ton of erotic stories to offer. There is literally no way that you could run out of new material to watch, if you are a working person, that is. They also update their stories frequently, so you will have new stories quite fucking often.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Friendly community, and good user-privileges</h3><p></p><p></p><p>If you want, you can become a member and post your own dirty erotic stories here. However, if you do plan to do that, then you should read and follow the rules of the site, as to how you should write the stories and what should not be written. One thing that really surprised me is that they claim that they will create an account for you if you have any issues (very nice of them).</p><p></p><p>As a member, you can browse all the stories, chat with the members in the comment section and even post your own stories, but if you are not a good writer, please do not. I only say that because I ran into some stories that were fucking boring, while there were also the ones that were hella interesting. This site does not need any bad stories, so please refrain from writing if you do not have imagination or experience.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Great writers and even better stories</h3><p></p><p></p><p>There was also another story that features the casual meeting of two strangers, who became fuck buddies and eventually developed feelings of each other. This was a very mainstream story, but the details made everything much better. Since I am reading a story instead of watching what actually happens I prefer when writers are able to paint a picture.</p><p></p><p>In the top right corner, as you can see they have some other offers, one of which are the forums, and if you have any questions or anything similar, you should visit that place. There you can talk to users and share your opinion… you know how fucking forums work. If you find a story you like, do not forget to visit that writer and check out other shit they have written.</p><p></p><p>The story that will suit your dirty taste always depends on your personal preference; for example, if you do not like Alien pornography, then you probably should not list through the stories that are tagged with ‘Alien’… Since there is so much content here, you are bound to find the crap that makes your pussy wet in no time, since I assume only women read erotic stories.</p><p></p><p>Whether this place is for you or not is something only you can decide after you have read this review or visited sexstories.com aka \"XNXX Sex Stories\" yourself. The main point of this site is that they have a lot of random stories offered, and you can read anything you want for free. Become a member, post your own shit, read stories, and have some dirty fun.</p>"}},{"id":"1608d49fa2df","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"1608d49fa2df","title":"CHYOA","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"FamilyStrokes.com Have you ever fantasized about your unrelated super sexy sister who came back from college and became lewd and flowing like a river because of you or your stepdaughter blocked you in the bedroom and unzipped your pants while your...","canonical":"https://theporndude.com/zh/1379/chyoa","affiliate_url":"https://chyoa.com/","rating":4,"siteOrder":17,"price":"free","tags":[],"features":[],"categories":[{"id":"best-erotic-stories-sites","collection":"categories_en"}],"screenshot_url":"https://cdn.staticstack.net/assets/img/r-thumbs/2bba30d-chyoa_small.png","image_alt":"CHYOA, porn story website","scraped_at":"2025-10-28T21:57:16.411Z","iconSpritesheet":"favicon-spritesheet.png","iconPosition":"-16px -544px","iconClassName":"icon1379","logoIconClass":"icon1379","pros":["a fun twist on regular erotica","collaborative storytelling","plenty of kinky fetish stories","active and critical user base"],"cons":["white site design"],"detailedDescription":"<p>I guess you're looking for interactive sex stories? Well, tell me. What’s the worst part about a book? Well, besides the obvious reading part. It’s all laid out there for you. It’s the same issue with most porn sites, videos, and all that shit. No user input. You don’t have any control. You just have to grip your dick and hang on for the ride. But it doesn’t have to be that way. Remember those oldschool \"choose your own adventure\" books? The ones where you made a character and got to decide what they did in the story. I know this isn’t the sexiest topic, but, dude, those books were the shit. I still get excited when I see them in a used book store. Almost as excited as I get when the cutie of a librarian lets me finger her way back in the stacks of forgotten history books.</p><p></p><p>You’re probably wondering what the fuck I’m on about right now. MissAVDH has finally watched too much porn and has gone off the deep end. No, It all comes together. I’ve found a porn site that’s pretty similar to those books. A choose your own adventure erotica site called CHYOA.com, which is what the name of the site stands for. And, for an erotica site, this place brings in the horny chicks and dudes by the fuckload. 3.5 million people come to the site every single month, and they’ve only been around since 2014. That’s some impressive shit.</p><p></p><p>The first thing I did when I went to this site was let out a sigh of frustration. The site design isn’t bad at all. Great formatting and logo and all of that shit. But a white background for a site built around staring at and reading text for hours. Come on. At least throw in a lights-off mode on the stories or something. The only thing I want to be straining is, uh, yeah I don’t know where I was heading with that one. Fuck eyestrain.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Thousands of Sexy Stories and Hundreds of Thousands of Individual Chapters</h3><p></p><p></p><p>But what the fuck does all of it mean? It could be a little overwhelming especially for some of you fucks who don’t have a creative bone in your body. That’s fine though. You can still just go ahead and use this site like a normal erotica site. Just click on some stories, whip out your dick, and try and cum along with the protagonist like everyone else does. But that’s not all you can do.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Add to Other People’s Stories, Let Others Contribute to Yours, and More!</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Anyone can add alternative chapters to keep the story going. People can add arcs that peter out and end based on certain decisions, while others could change everything and run off into its own completely separate story from the original. It’s the kind of site that a nerdy art chick who always wears chokers would go to when she wants to shove her Bad Dragon tentacle up her pussy.</p><p></p><p>To get started, just make a free account. There’s no catch or anything to deal with here. In fact, there aren't even ads on the site. All of the support and costs are covered by the generous patreon donations from the users. And, if you’re more looking to chat with other users outside of the stories, then hit up the CHYOA forum. It’s just as active as the site, so you shouldn’t have any trouble finding other horny people to talk to.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Frequent Updates, No Ads, and Tons of Fetish Content</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Other than that, you just need to dive into some stories. It’s like showing up twenty minutes late to a bukkake shoot. Do you, like, wave at the director and step in? Everyone’s already jerking off and she’s all naked. You just have to go for it. Same here. There’s a lot of stories to go through, and you just need to take the plunge. And most of them are written well, so don’t feel like this place is going to be full of DeviantArt level drivel. Personally, I recommend “The Lodge” as a good starting point. Well written story with over 100 chapters.</p><p></p><p>The previews for each chapter have a small image that doesn’t mean all that much to the story. More of an indicator for what the setting or main protag looks like. You’ll get a tag for what sort of story it is (I.E. fan fiction, sci-fi, mind control), how many chapters have been written for it, and when the last update was. When you click on the story, you’ll see a small summary/idea of what the theme of the story is on the right, along with perspective, other tags, views, likes, comments, and all that good stuff. From there, you read through each chapter and either pick what decision you’d like to make based off of the other chapters or write up your own naughty shit!</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Easily Readable Mobile Site</h3><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>MissAVDH’s Favorite Features</h3><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>MissAVDH’s Suggestions</h3><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>MissAVDH’s Final Thoughts</h3><p></p>"}},{"id":"c914d64226de","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"c914d64226de","title":"Lush Stories","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"LushStories.com is a growing collection of porn literature.

One of the glorious things about porno is that it lets us see our fantasies played out in lurid, living color. Sometimes, though, your fantasies get ruined by bad acting, unenthusiastic humping or fucked-up breast implants. I know some of you perverts are into stuff too kinky for video, too. These are just a couple of the reasons erotic story sites like lushstories.com will always stick around, even in a futuristic world of live webcam boobs and VR sex helmets.</p><p></p><p>Written porn obviously ain’t for everyone. It takes a little more effort and brainpower to do the reading and imagine the depravity than having it injected straight into your eyeballs. It’s worth it to LushStories’s visitors, though, who still flock to the site by the millions more than a decade after its inception.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Erotic Stories By the Numbers</h3><p></p><p></p><p>The very top of the screen says the site has nearly 400k members. Almost 4k of them are online now, and 84 of them are currently in chat rooms. That indicates a very active community of perverts. An active community means there’s always a conversation, and more than 3 million forum posts back that up. The active community also suggests a lot of filthy content.</p><p></p><p>That suggestion is proven with more numbers. They’ve published more than 50k stories, nearly 400k images, and more than 200k blog posts. The front page shows just the tip of that collection.</p><p></p><p>I can’t help noticing the Login box. Above the username and password fields is a button that says Join Lush. It makes me think of bath bombs, and a donation-supported smut site being completely crushed by a big cosmetic company if anybody notices the shared name. WTF do I know about copyright law?</p><p></p><p></p><h3>There’s Erotic Poetry, Too</h3><p></p><p>Then went to the poetry section</p><p>I read a few rhymes</p><p>And wasted my time</p><p>And that’s how I lost my erection</p><p></p><p>LushStories’s collection only shows Stories by default, but you can also choose to show Poems or All. The poetry section is updated nearly as much as the stories, which shocked the ever-living fuck out of me. I figured it was the kind of self-indulgence you get on any site devoted to masturbating, but people are actually rating and commenting on the stuff.</p><p></p><p>Me? I’m more into the low-brow life advice scratched into filthy bathroom stalls. The poetry on LushStories takes itself a lot more seriously. It’s the kind of poetry that doesn’t even rhyme most of the time. I ain’t a connoisseur, but I think you art fags are going to be happy.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>A Constant Stream of Written Porno</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Any method you choose might be a little overwhelming. There’s a lot here, and man, it’s fucking filthy. You’re going to love it.</p><p></p><p>We really live in a golden age of porn. Whatever you’re into, there’s so much of it coming out right now, and it’s so fucking easy to get to. LushStories is like a gushing stream of porn stories. There are a few dozen stories on the front page, and they’ve all been uploaded within the last couple of days.</p><p></p><p>Since the sex scenes are all text, the new items look more like a blog than the thumbnailed lists you see on other free sex sites. Each story has a one-sentence summary, the intro paragraph, and some basic info like word count and date added. The most useful information is the Average Score, the Categories, and the Tags.</p><p></p><p>I half-expected all the stories to be in one category, written by a couple of weirdos who took over the site after being kicked off Reddit and 4chan for being too perverted. There’s actually a pretty wide variety.</p><p></p><p>The newest story is Part 1 of a story about online fuck buddies. It’s tagged with Oral, Straight Sex, and Same Room Sex and filed under Swingers. Earlier in the day, someone added a First Time story about a young man helping a lady motorist and getting a free lesson in exchange. The tags on this one are surely enticing to somebody: Frustrate, Puncture, Bold, Engorged, Moiston.</p><p></p><p>There’s an Interracial tale with Blowjob and BBC, and a Cuckold story that has Domination, Chastity, Medical, and Edging. There’s a Straight Sex story that takes place in a Tent at a music festival, and a MILF piece with Exhibitionism, Voyeur, and Vacation.</p><p></p><p>Only a few of the new stories are under a thousand words. These are full-length literary fuckfests running thousands of words. A couple on the front page run nearly 10,000 words each, or about 40 pages printed. There’s very easily a whole novel’s worth of sex scenes published on LushStories every week.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>What Kinda Freaky Shit You Into?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>That’s just the newest stuff, though. Next, I sorted the whole collection by most popular of all time. The very top story is a bit of Voyeur erotica called Nightline. It’s got Masturbation, Three-Way, and Public Sex. It was added to LushStories way back in 2012, so the story’s got some real staying power. The second most popular story is another voyeur story by the same author.</p><p></p><p>Things start to get a little harder as we move down the page. There’s rough sex with Choking, Gagging, and Rimming. There’s a Taboo seduction story called college students, which is already enough information to make me raging hard, and another first-time story filed under Lesbian and opening with mom walking into the room.</p><p></p><p>First times are popular as hell here, as are all kinds of depraved activities on college campuses that would make the woke fuckers piss themselves, which could then be written into a story filed under Watersports. There’s a good amount of Science Fiction and Fantasy, but it doesn’t dominate the place like on a hentai site.</p><p></p><p>The full Categories list is short. In fact, it’s too short for a collection of over 50,000 stories. I looked for a page with a long list, expecting hundreds, but they’re all on the left sidebar. It’s just a few dozen subgenres of literary porno.</p><p></p><p>The list does have some kinky shit you don’t find on most porn sites. There’s Mind Control and Horror. Taboo is labeled as Taboo Fantasies which I find interesting. They didn’t point out that the Monster Sex was probably just fantasy, too. There were a few big holes in their catalog that I see on other story sites, so I checked the FAQ.</p><p></p><p>LushStories doesn’t allow stories with even references to minors, nor do they allow any abuse, or various kinds of violence. They allow piss but no shit. Sex with animals is prohibited by the rules, and there’s not even a furry section. There’s no fan fiction, either, or stories with celebrities. Breaking any of the rules can get you banned.</p><p></p><p>Most of you are going to be fine with those rules, but I know some of you are going to go scrambling. Check my big list of story sites to find your bag. Besides the content restrictions, my only issue was that such a big collection could be organized a little better. Convincing writers to tag their stories better and work on their summaries would be step one.</p><p></p><p>Overall, LushStories is worth a look if you’re into sexy stories. It’s free, so you’ve got nothing to lose, and it’s a fucking massive library. I’d recommend this one in particular if the other erotic lit sites are too hardcore and kinky for you.</p>"}},{"id":"debcadff2280","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"debcadff2280","title":"StoriesOnline","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"Men have been looking for innovative ways of masturbation since history.

We were fortunate enough to be born at a time where, with nothing more than the click of a button, we are able to access a near-infinite number of sexy sluts ready to please. We can even throw on a pair of virtual reality goggles and watch as our living rooms instantly turn into porn sets and supermodels appear before us, ready to suck our dicks for free. Ah, we are too fucking lucky.</p><p></p><p>This, of course, was not always the case. Have you ever wondered how lonely fappers such as yourselves got off before the advent of video cameras? How about before the film? It’s not like people just didn’t please themselves way back then to things other than their own memories and imaginations. Oh, they most certainly did. The only difference being that, instead of busting nuts to photos and videos of naked girls, they busted nuts to books.</p><p></p><p>The tradition of erotic literature goes all the way back to the days of ancient Sumer. One of the first known iterations of literary smut came in the form of a cycle of poems that revolved around the goddess Inanna getting fucked silly by her consort, Demuzid the Sheppard. I bet that shit blew the minds of ancient Sumerian men of the time. Fucking an actual goddess? Now that’s the dream.</p><p></p><p>Many examples of erotic poetry also survived Ancient Greece and Rome. The Greek poets Straton of Sardis and Sappho of Lesbos (lol) were world-renowned for their groundbreaking erotic verse, and the tradition of erotic prose found its origins in the 17th and 18th centuries. Today, of course, erotic fiction is a giant in the world of publishing, and the genre enjoys an avid and active base of amateur authors and readers as well.</p><p></p><p>In other words, the ancient tradition of erotic lit is alive and well in 2018, even though there are millions of websites dedicated to hardcore porn. Some people just prefer to read their porn, as opposed to watching it. I wonder if many erotic lit fans are those people you hear about who identify as sapiosexual (they find the intellect hotter than the physical appearance). At any rate, there are plenty of sites to check out if you get off primarily on the story.</p><p></p><p>Storiesonline.net has a somewhat deceitfully innocent-sounding name. I could see a lot of people visiting this site, expecting to find some Hemingway shorts, The Tempest, or maybe some Dickens to enjoy. Instead, though, what they will find are plenty of dicks enjoying short skirts and temptation. Stories Online is a huge database of erotic literature—full books, short stories, and nonfiction all revolving around the oldest of human pursuits: sex.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>This Site is a Time Capsule</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Where it gets confusing are the navigation buttons found underneath all that. “Preview Site” allows you to “preview the site without having to register,” even though I had no trouble accessing any of the content on the site without registering (although I couldn’t access full texts).</p><p></p><p>“Story Showcase” offers another sort of preview feature. “A sample of the story gems you can find on the site,” reads this button’s subtitle. Then you have log-in, register, and post your stories, all appearing as three separate buttons. No streamlined log-in/register box like we’ve become accustomed to; no, this site looks like it was designed in the mid-90s and has not been updated since.</p><p></p><p>Below these bubble links, Storiesonline lists hyperlinks to all of the genres that they feature on the site. Quickly jump to your favorite—they have erotic sex stories, science fiction, true stories, mystery, fantasy, horror, time travel, historical, and BDSM just to name a few. Underneath the genre list, they’ve also included a mission statement, which reads, in part, “Stories are our focus, including sex stories and erotica. Storiesonline is the home of thousands of authors showcasing their erotic writing talents.”</p><p></p><p>Speaking of their “showcasing” of erotic authors, one cool aspect of Storiesonline is that they allow writers to submit their work for publication on the site. I don’t believe that there is any sort of acceptance or rejection process, though. It seems as if members can just post whatever they want for others to read and rate. Stories, then, earn an average rating based on a 10-point system. So, although authors may not be able to count their storiesonline' posts as official publications, it still seems like a great way to gauge how readers are reacting to them. Maybe, for example, before deciding whether or not to go on to publish them.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>An Engaged Community of Horny Readers and Writers</h3><p></p><p></p><p>In addition to a seemingly active and engaged community of authors and readers, they also have contests. It doesn’t appear authors win anything (other than publicity and bragging rights), but I still think it’s a great way to stoke creativity and participation among the community.</p><p></p><p>Although the site design is poor, it does seem to be organized and archived pretty extensively. Search by new stories, authors, an alphabetical database, category, reviews, blogs, even universes (the fictional worlds in which stories take place). On top of all that, Storiesonline even features a separate forum for authors and readers to discuss works. There is plenty to keep you busy as a horny creative on this site.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Raising the Bar (And My Dick)</h3><p></p><p></p><p>I’m willing to bet that storiesonline’s rating system probably does not hurt when it comes to incentivizing quality work as well. Whatever the reason, the stories are engaging, well-written, and interesting. Although I can’t really see myself fapping to something like this, I did feel a couple of twitches here and there in my pants when the stories started heating up. So, kudos to you, Storiesonline writers—keep up the good work.</p><p></p><p>Another great aspect of Storiesonline is the site’s lack of ads. You have no idea how rare this truly is in the world of online porn. Well, actually, you probably do, since all you do is sit at home and jack off all day anyway. But, still, it’s always a breath of fresh air to visit a porn site of any type, especially a free one, and not be bombarded by ads. It just goes to show that it is possible to run a porn site without advertisements. I do it. Storiesonline does it. A few others do it. The rest of you greedy ass sons of bitches need to get your shit together and follow suit!</p><p></p><p>At the end of the day, Storiesonline.net is a great platform for authors and readers alike to come together and celebrate a shared love of erotic lit. There’s a real sense of community to it and the site’s contests and rating system really keep the bar raised for quality writing. Even though the website could definitely use a serious facelift, I am happy about the lack of ads and the opportunities that Storiesonline presents to aspiring authors.</p><p></p><p>After reading all these erotic stories, though, I am all revved up for some good, old fashioned porno. Even as a voracious reader, there’s still just nothing better than actually seeing and hearing sexy chicks getting fucked. The imagination will only take you so far. But, if you are a lover of erotic lit, definitely give this site a try. Happy fapping, fuckers!</p>"}},{"id":"1c238e467225","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"1c238e467225","title":"AdultFanFiction","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"Adultfanfiction.org is an art platform that allows those with creative thinking to show their talents here.

I know, I know, some of you fucks out there need a full VR headset with a heated, auto lubed, ultra fuck master 1000 with the gyrating pussy add-on to get your chaffed, desensitized dick to spurt out its 10th pathetic dribble of cum out for the day.</p><p></p><p>This site isn’t for you.

And, as far as trans fiction sites go, this is definitely one of the most successful ones I’ve seen. They bring in right around 2 million trans story fanatics to the site on a monthly basis. And this site has been kicking it for a good while. I couldn’t find exactly when they launched, but they have stories dating as far back as 1999.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Well Organized Site Despite HTML Design</h3><p></p><p></p><p>When you first pop over to the site you’ll get a full disclaimer about the content on the site. So, you have no fucking excuses now. I warned you. They warned you. What I noticed right up front though is that there aren’t any restrictions on the stories you can tell. Well, as long as they’re about trans sluts. You can go vanilla, extreme, or whatever else your fetish filled mind could come up with.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Share Your Own Steamy Stories or Check Out and Review Others</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Below that, you’ll see a list of random reviews. Any registered user can read stories and review them. This site is all about sharing hot stories and getting feedback on them. And this isn’t the kind of feedback you see on porn videos like “I would luv to touch her tight vagene.” The people on this site care about the content posted here. If you put up shitty writing or try and be a troll, then prepare for some backlash. And not the sexy kind of lashings either.</p><p></p><p>From there, you’ll want to use the header to hop around. It has options for “Message Board, New Stories, Search, Info, and Title Images.” That last one lets users submit photos that have the possibility of popping up on the homepage with a quote. New stories, of course, lets you check out the newest stories. And I was surprised to see that multiple stories get uploaded here on a daily basis. There’s always some new, smutty stories to fap to. And the message board is simply a place to post questions or have discussions about the site or other trans topics.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Excellent Search Options Make it Easy to Find Your Next Favorite Author</h3><p></p><p></p><p>But it’s time to talk about the stories. No matter what you’re searching for, you’ll get a list of links to stories in that category. The previews give you the title, format, author (along with the number of stories they have written), link to reviews, date published, rating, synopsis, categories, keywords, file size, and age range of characters. Phew, talk about a fuck ton of information. I fucking love it.</p><p></p><p>Click on the title to get taken to a page where you can read the story. All of the stories have the same plain text format that you would expect from an HTML site. It’s readable as is, but some of you might be more comfortable zooming in. Or you can just lean forward while you jerk off, though your fat ass might shake the desk too much. From there you just scroll on through and read the story. No fancy controls or anything like that to fuck around with.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Clunky, but Functional Mobile Site</h3><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>MissAVDH’s Favorite Features</h3><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>MissAVDH’s Suggestions</h3><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>MissAVDH’s Final Thoughts</h3><p></p>"}},{"id":"233e25fadc93","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"233e25fadc93","title":"MCStories","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"MCStories.comMC Stories is a website dedicated to sharing analytical reviews and commenting on fictional pornographic literature works, including short stories serialized novels and poems, usually containing extremely vivid scenes 15,00 uploaded on this website...","canonical":"https://theporndude.com/zh/253/mcstories","affiliate_url":"https://mcstories.com/","rating":3,"siteOrder":23,"price":"free","tags":[],"features":[],"categories":[{"id":"best-erotic-stories-sites","collection":"categories_en"}],"screenshot_url":"https://cdn.staticstack.net/assets/img/r-thumbs/cbf06_MCStories_small.jpg","image_alt":"MCStories, porn story website","scraped_at":"2025-10-28T21:57:53.464Z","iconSpritesheet":"favicon-spritesheet.png","iconPosition":"-272px -96px","iconClassName":"icon253","logoIconClass":"icon253","pros":["there are over 15,000 stories to choose from","the categories range from kinky to weird and taboo","the site’s community is very communicative","you can view stories from your single preferred author","all trolls are banned and toxic behavior is not tolerated"],"cons":["the site’s design is extremely dull","there is no search bar in sight","the stories are written by amateurs, so some can be bad","the ‘garden of mc’ section can be difficult to navigate"],"detailedDescription":"<p>MC Stories, aka The Erotic Mind Control Stories Archive!

If you’ve ever been a fan of erotic stories and have the patience to read in order to get turned on as opposed to the millions of people with a 1-second attention span who watch porn videos, then this website is definitely for you.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>It Covers a Very ‘Dominant’ Theme of Erotic Stories</h3><p></p><p></p><p>And of course, there are the more taboo stories, which include some pretty fucked up scenarios that aren’t always realistic. It’s safe to say that all the stuff on here is ’dominant’, because the characters who get fucked in the stories usually end up in that situation by being the subject of some form of mind-control, and that’s just the kind of kick that most of the horny cunts who read this stuff need in order to get properly aroused.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>More Than Enough Categories to Choose From</h3><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Can’t Choose? Let the Readers Choose For You</h3><p></p><p></p><p>This section contains dozens of stories picked out by members who as far as I can tell, know their shit when it comes to this kind of stuff. It’s not a regularly updated section meaning that there are no daily-added stories, but it already has enough picks for you to sift through for weeks, and I’m sure you’ll like what some of the members have picked out if you’re one of the few people who prefer reading their pornography as opposed to watching,</p><p></p><p></p><h3>The Recent Additions Section Is Always Buzzing</h3><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Discuss Mind-Control Erotica With Fellow Like-Minded Members</h3><p></p><p></p><p>You also can always see how many official members and guests are active at the same time, but if you want to comment on existing threads or create new ones you’ll have to officially become a part of the mind-control erotica family and make an account for yourself. From what I’ve seen here, this is a pretty tight-knit community mostly consisting of members who know each other, so if you’re planning on joining them you’d better be a big fan of this type of porn or you probably won’t fit in.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>The MC Garden – The Member’s Playground</h3><p></p><p></p><p>For example, there’s a subsection here called ‘The Challenge Grounds’, where members can have writing contests and exhibitions (what they get for winning these contests is unknown). There’s also another section called the ‘Reflection Pool of Reviews’, which is a place where members can review and critique stories written by other members – because only true experts of weird mind-control fiction can judge it properly. There are also several other sections like ‘The Silver Lining’, where members can write about anything they’d like other than the standard mind-control stuff, as well as ‘The Vineyard’, which contains incomplete stories, ongoing serials and mind-control erotica posted on other sites. There are a lot of subsections here which have gay poetic names given to them instead of actual useful names, so you probably won’t know where the fuck you’re going or what you’re doing here if you’re new.</p>"}},{"id":"06324f171e54","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"06324f171e54","title":"BDSM Library","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"BDSMlibrary.com is a website that is almost 20 years old.

Tell me. Were you neglected as a child? Did your father beat you? Were you bullied? Is there a gripping childhood trauma in your soul that comes to the surface every time you face a crisis? If so, then you’re a top candidate to be a BDSM fan. BDSM Library is an iconic XXX website dedicated to delivering nothing but the best BDSM porn to the world in all formats, shapes, and sizes. This is a real haven for the worldwide BDSM community because its forums have been active with fans talking about how they like to be the top or bottom since 2001 – that’s 17 years of in-depth debates, lectures, experiences and general knowledge which literally makes up the ‘library’ of BDSMlibrary.com. Regardless if you’re a fanatic who likes to get spanked (or do the spanking) every other day, if you’re a casual BDSM-er who had an girlfriend that liked getting choked, or you’re a sick freak of a virgin who likes jacking off to humiliation and simulated torture porn, you’re sure to appreciate what this enormous website has on offer.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Free Membership</h3><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Stories All Around</h3><p></p><p></p><p>But you’re wrong, and you should feel bad about yourself because you’re probably a &lt;100 IQ loser who stays at home and jerks off all day while your parents sigh in disappointment. The bondage stories on here are A-grade BDSM material and will definitely get the right person aroused, after all, as it says on the site; “Our largest sexual organ is still the human mind and it's limited only by your imagination.” And that means that if you ever hope to transcend your porn-consumption to a higher, more refined level, then you’re gonna have to put down the photos and videos and start doing some reading and imagining.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>The Galleries are Here Too</h3><p></p><p></p><p>And they’re properly categorized too, so you can find what you’re looking for with relative ease – 41 categories of organized, vintage and new BDSM pictures that will make any dedicated fan feel like a kid in a candy store. There’s everything here, from amateurs, Asian, black &amp; couples to the more extreme, out-there shit like simulated torture, smothering, slaves, water, punishment, pregnant and so on. Even cartoons and furries can join in on the fun with their own dedicated category. Basically, if you can imagine it, it’s probably there, and chances are it’s nowhere else to be found on the world wide web.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Wanna Watch Hot BDSM Videos?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Now I’m not saying this website is inherently bad for doing this, because the videos they have available are all professionally-filmed XXX movies. That’s right – not an amateur video in sight, even the ‘amateur’ category in the video section has professionally-filmed XXX movies that claim to have amateurs in their cast. Still, I wouldn’t let this fact deter me away from this website because regardless of the paywall that’s blocking the videos, there’s still PLENTY of free and interactive shit on here that’s sure to make this place worth your time.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Live Chat Rooms With Fellow Members</h3><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Live Fetish Webcams</h3><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>The Website is Definitely in Need of an Update</h3><p></p><p></p><p>One fine example of this is when you enter the chat room section, where the rules state: “YOU MUST REGISTER BEFORE ENTERING CHAT!! If you enter the chat as an unregistered user, you will be immediately kicked from the room.” Then there’s other stuff like: “Please select your user name (�nick�) carefully, as it is somewhat difficult to change your name. To change your user name, you will need Contact Torq either by PM on the forum or by email at AdminChat38@hotmail.com.”</p><p></p><p>It seems obvious that the admins put this into the website back in 2001, when using the internet wasn’t an everyday thing for pretty much all the Western world and people needed helpful hints on how to navigate through simple websites. This doesn’t go hand-in-hand with nostalgia, and it’d probably be best if the admins just updated the whole website to be more functional while still retaining its classic look. Also, one last thing, at this moment, half of the site’s categories are broken links – that really kind of fucks up the whole user experience, doesn’t it?</p>"}},{"id":"37018ab01c69","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"37018ab01c69","title":"NovelTrove","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"NovelTrove.com Intellectual Pornography Content High Quality Pornography Literature for People with High IQ","canonical":"https://theporndude.com/zh/1484/noveltrove","affiliate_url":"https://noveltrove.com/","rating":3,"siteOrder":25,"price":"free","tags":[],"features":[],"categories":[{"id":"best-erotic-stories-sites","collection":"categories_en"}],"screenshot_url":"https://cdn.staticstack.net/assets/img/r-thumbs/8301f50-noveltrove_small.png","image_alt":"NovelTrove, porn story website","scraped_at":"2025-10-28T21:58:05.280Z","iconSpritesheet":"favicon-spritesheet.png","iconPosition":"-256px -576px","iconClassName":"icon1484","logoIconClass":"icon1484","pros":["hot porn stories","free/no ads","lots of categories","can earn money"],"cons":["only good if you want to read porn stories"],"detailedDescription":"<p>There was a time when you would go to a special bookstore to browse the erotic novels on the shelves.

BDSM, anal, group sex and trans stories are all here. Just click on a category to see what is waiting here for you. Of course, if you have a very specific interest click on the little magnifying glass in the upper right corner that will lead you what you’re looking for.</p><p></p><p>This story porn site is completely free to use.

If you're looking for bondage and kinky stories, you might want to give BDSMCafe.com a try. Some would say that this story is geared more towards women. They say that many women enjoy reading erotica rather than looking at porn. The layout is pretty feminine and modern in design, with short stories and novels being added constantly. It's simple to use and get into the actual content too so you won't be browsing for hours before you read your erotica. I love how the first thing you see is a great slider with beautiful images to accompany the stories being advertised. Not only do they have stories, both short and longer, they also have some resources for learning about BDSM topics.</p><p></p><p>They have a video section which mostly features videos from the popular BDSM porn site, Wasteland, but this is not the main focus of the site at all. They really do take story submissions so if you think you’ve got a dirty mind, then you should start typing and send it in. If they think it is good enough they will put it up on their site and you’ll be on your way to BDSM story stardom. Who knows, it could be how you become the next EL James. If you’ve never read an erotic story before and are more like a porn guy, I suggest giving it a try. It’s way hotter than you’d think, although I’m still a hardcore porn guy myself!</p><p></p><p>When you click on a story, it will load in your web browser, so there is no option to download but this isn't a problem as you can just copy and paste into Word to print if reading on the screen isn't your thing. Tags are also used on the bottom of the stories, in case you want to try to find stories with the same types of themes. In addition to short stories they have novels, and even some poetry. So, if literature is what you’re looking for you’ll be kinkily pleased with the offerings here. You really can’t go wrong with BDSM Cafe if what you are looking for it erotic BDSM stories. There are some really high quality tales woven here, that will get you hot and wet for whatever sexy business is coming to you in the future.</p>"}},{"id":"e72f204b70a2","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"e72f204b70a2","title":"Reddit GoneWild Stories","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"I've said before that I love pornographic books, but today I stumbled upon a perfect Reddit sub-site that I can share with you.

You can’t expect generations who have grown up staring at screens to pay much attention to the world around them anyway, especially when all those hot juicy porn videos are online and freely watchable.</p><p></p><p>There are millions of porn clips on the internet right now, and there has been for a long time - and one of the best things about them is that they’re pretty much free real estate for anyone in need of a good lonely time. But the fucked up thing here is that these videos and every other attention-grabbing thing that exists on the internet have made the average attention span of young people dwindle down to just a few seconds at a time.</p><p></p><p>Not this isn’t necessarily a bad thing, but it renders you incapable of focusing on one thing for too long - and disciplining yourself in a world where everyone else around you is also in the same overstimulated hell isn’t easy. Still, it does go a long way in helping you if you do manage to get a hold of it. I know one sure way you can make your attention span last for up to 30 seconds or more, though - and that’s by reading pornography.</p><p></p><p>You know when people tell you “the book is much better than the movie because it has so many more details put into it”? Well, that’s the experience you want to aim for when reading something, and if you love porn, then, of course, you’ll love to read crazy sex stories. <strong>Millions of people have posted crazy and spontaneous sex adventures onto /r/GoneWildStories here</strong>. Let me tell you why this 412k thousand-strong Subreddit should become your go-to when you want to crank one or two out.</p><p></p><h3>So You’ve Got Cheating Stories</h3><p></p><p></p><p>But even if they are, don’t get too mad cause some people just cheat to feel better about themselves so they can be a better partner to you. So be the bigger person and don’t go down that route - just masturbate to some stories of cheating instead of actually doing it. You’re guaranteed to get the same authentic kind of sexual tension that comes out of it from these stories anyway because they’re all as real as can be. Or, if you don’t like this kind of stuff, you’re more than welcome to check out my XXX site listings.</p><p></p><h3>Confessions</h3><p></p><p></p><p>This site has <strong>plenty of confession sex stories</strong> that will open your eyes and let you see just what magnitude of despicable acts people are capable of. I bet tons of dirty catholic priests do some “sinful, naughty things” while women tell them their confessions - I bet they even make them go into detail about every little thing just so they can get one hell of a kick out of it.</p><p></p><h3>And Ultra-Slutty No Regrets Stories</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Imagine your own spouse cheating on you with your own sibling, and you have no clue about it - your sibling could even have a good relationship with you and see you frequently, and you wouldn’t have the faintest idea that they touched, rubbed, bumped and ground genitals with the same person you do the same thing with. These things do happen folks, and <strong>/r/GoneWildStories here has plenty of real-life examples of these kinds of outrageous sex stories</strong>.</p><p></p><h3>And They’re All 100% True</h3><p></p><p></p><h3>But You Can’t Really Separate, Organize or Segregate Any of The Posts Here</h3><p></p><p></p><h3>The Reddit App Works Flawlessly On Mobile Devices</h3><p></p><p></p><p>In these dark times of social distancing and quarantining, everyone needs to get their kick somehow on the internet, and the Reddit app is perfect for killing time and wasting sperm cells.

Sure, a lady can show you her titties or her hoo-ha and your brain goes straight into horny reproductive mode, but a few well-strung words can have the exact same effect. I know a lot of modern masturbators have gotten used to the futuristic magic of instant 4K porno videos, forgetting all about the older masturbatory formats like text-based cybersex and erotic stories. Maybe you haven’t noticed yet, but modern technology has brought neat little spins on a lot of old classics. This next website is a perfect fucking example of that.</p><p></p><p>Considering they get hundreds of thousands of visitors a month, it’s fair to say these guys ain’t peddling the same old boring porn stories you can find anywhere else. As much as I love raunchy tales, it’s hard to garner that much attention for them in this day and age, especially with so much good porno out there. ChatMeHard.net is like a cosmic gumbo combining the best of Choose-Your-Own-Adventure stories, sexting, and good, old fashioned literary smut. Basically, <strong>they’re offering interactive, immersive sex stories that put you in a starring role</strong>. It ain’t quite VR, but it sure sounds fun and doesn’t require an expensive and stupid-looking masturbation helmet.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Chat Me Hard, Baby!</h3><p></p><p></p><p>“Hey handsome. You up?” reads an incoming text from Stepmom. A couple reply options appear briefly before a simple greeting is chosen, which leads to, “Well, I know we promised we’d never speak of THAT night… but I can’t get your dick out of my head!” <strong>ChatMeHard is realistic enough to include dirty photos and videos, just like real sexting would</strong>, so this message is accompanied by an animated GIF of a hot blonde sucking cock.</p><p></p><p>It's a very quick, simple and effective demonstration of how the site works. You’ll be sexting with multiple choice answers, similar to the auto-replies my phone is always suggesting, but way filthier. Your decisions/texts drive the story, and the text-based presentation makes you feel like you’re really in the story, interacting with the characters.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Sending Dirty Texts to My Fake Hotwife</h3><p></p><p></p><p>I decided to check out a story called Your Girlfriend Gets You A Promotion Part I. According to the stats, it’s a 12-minute read with 16 pics and GIFs, and this chick Nelly looks hot in the thumbnail. The one small catch to the free stuff is that you’ve got to register an account and verify your email, which ain’t an unfair trade if you ask me.</p><p></p><p>Chat Me Hard is web-based instead of having its own separate app, which makes it convenient to play with on your phone or your desktop. Starting up the story, I got a “text” from My Love asking if I wanted to see bisexual options. I declined and the story began. “Hey babe. I’ve got something BIG to share with you,” she wrote. Turns out she got me a promotion, but there’s a catch: she’s going to have to fuck my boss.</p><p></p><p>I played the role as an enthusiastic cuck with a sexy hot wife, though there were options for me to reply more conservatively. My Love ended up sending me a mirror selfie in a sexy dress, the one she’s planning on wearing for the boss. A few texts later, she sent a tit-groping video as she told me what she was telling my boss. “I’m going to be on my knees and he'll smack my face with his big cock while pulling it out.”</p><p></p><p>I have to admit, I’m pretty fucking impressed. I was a little skeptical going in, but they’ve done a great job with the writing and the presentation. I love how the story unfolds quickly enough to catch your attention and keep it right away, while also maintaining a nice level of realism. The texts come through faster than they would in real life, but the short pauses help it feel more immersive. They dole out the media at nice intervals, too, ramping up the dirtiness as we progress. Soon enough, My Love was sending me masturbation videos she shot in the mirror.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Interactive Stories, All Types of Fun</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Honestly, if I have any complaint about the setup, it’s right here. I can’t stress the importance of tagging enough, whether we’re talking about a free tube, a premium site, a blog, or a porn stories library. Good tagging ensures you can find exactly what you want to beat off to, no matter how big and varied the collection gets. ChatMeHard.net only has about a dozen tags right now, which is alright but not great.</p><p></p><p>So, what are the current ChatMeHard.net categories? You’ll find the short list of tags at the top of the Stories page, and they include Anal, Big Ass, Big Tits, Bully and College. There’s Femdom and Freeuse, Maledom and Cuckold, MILF, Sex toys, Step-fantasy and Teens (18+). That’s it, save for an Other category where they stick everything else.</p><p></p><p>Like I said, it ain’t a terrible list of tags, especially if your interests are already listed. As the site matures, I hope they add more tags so it’s easier to find blowjobs, foot fetish content, BDSM, and basically anything else you might want to crank off to.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Chat Me Hard, Again and Again</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Speaking of, I bet some of the creatives pervs out there have been wondering about creating their own sext stories. Well, they just released a public beta version of the ChatMeHard Editor, so why not give it a shot? I’m looking forward to seeing the catalog fill out, and maybe you could help me with that. The only downside I can see for readers would be all those prices adding up. I think an all-you-can-fap monthly subscription plan would be a nice option to have.</p><p></p><p>ChatMeHard.net was a nice little surprise to start my week with. It’s a neat concept, and I’ll be damned if they didn’t fucking crush it with the execution. Perhaps it’s the simplicity and immediacy of sexting that makes it such a rich medium for storytelling, and maybe it’s our daily familiarity with the format that makes it feel so immersive and realistic. Even if I’m way off about the reasons, it’d been a fun and unique change of my usual masturbatory routine. There are plenty of freebies, so check those out and see how they make you feel.</p>"}}]

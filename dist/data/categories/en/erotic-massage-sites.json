When I get done slapping my meat stick, my thoughts often meander over to my fans. I feel bad for you, poor beta bastards. Not because you fucks never bone chicks or because your such a miserable and lonely chap, although those things ring true. It's because you'll never know what it's like to be me playing pocket pool. I am a master of masturbation.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>The Jerking Giant</h3><p></p><p></p><p>If I gave you guys one handjob, you'd all spend the rest of your lives following me around, pleading for a second. I'm sorry, guys. I hate to break it to you, but you're never getting a hand job from me. This hand is going to the grave, having only touched one penis. Mine.</p><p></p><p>However, there is a way you can receive an old-fashioned hand job that's almost as superb as mine. The only thing is, you'll have to get far more comfortable with yourself than you are now. I know self-knowledge is not in my fan's wheelhouse. You fucks all live in the imaginary world of your choosing. It's time to join the real world and get a happy ending from a talented full-service masseuse.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Who Does it Best?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Have it figured out? Did you say Asians? If you said no, congrats on still being a loser. It's no shock that you guys are masters of self-deceit. The only reason my fans are capable of getting out of bed in the morning is due to an elaborate construct of lies they tell themselves. Otherwise, the crushing depth of your own inadequacy would be too much for you to handle.</p><p></p><p>The fact is, no one treats a cock as well as Asian bitches. Massage Planet is your source for local full-service massage specialists. They have a flock of fuckable Asian whores ready to explore your underground and make you cum. It doesn't matter if you prefer a whore from the Middle Kingdom or like to venture deeper toward Korean, Thai, and Japanese sluts. You'll find an incredible full-service masseuse or Massage Planet.</p><p></p><p>Asian bitches on Massage Planet are known for their unwavering devotion to the penis and deliciously erotic skill set. They have a certain naive appeal that can disarm any dick. The light caramel or porcelain skin tone, almond eyes, and trim bodies are enough to drive anyone to the brink of orgasm. You'll want to explore every nook and cranny of these bitches pussies with a microscope and telescope.</p><p></p><p>If you're the type who likes women who can join you in erecting a tent, you'll love Massage Planet's selection of Asian massage therapists. Your tent will be fully erect. One look at these cunt's soft hands, and you'll pull your dick in no time flat.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Not Your Grandmas Newspaper Classifieds</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Asianladies will look very familiar to my readers. It's basically a massage ad tube site. You can scroll along just like you would on Redtube or Youporn. But, instead of only seeing the cunts, you can visit them.</p><p></p><p>Before we get to what makes Massage Planet the incredible full-service massage site it is, I have to talk about the design. It's pretty fucking chaotic. Imagine if Las Vegas and Tokyo had a baby, and that baby went on to design neon signs and build porn sites. That's what the place looks like.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Design</h3><p></p><p></p><p>The main menu resides up top and contains the options Home, Forums, What're new, Classifieds, 411, Groups, Awards, Confessions, Ads Manager, Log in, Reg411, Customize the Layout, and Light mode.</p><p></p><p>\"What's new\" is a drop-down menu with the options New posts, New articles, New article comments, New classifieds, and Latest activity.</p><p></p><p>If you would like to try your hand at dressing like an Asian bitch and jerking dudes off, you can create your own ad on Massage Planet. Ads manager is a drop-down menu with the options You ads, Your invoices, and Create ad.</p><p></p><p>Creating ads is fast and easy and sure to bring you customers. Well, not you in particular, but actual Asian massage therapists for sure.</p><p></p><p>For the younger crew, \"the 4-1-1\" used to mean \"the latest news.\" As such, 411 includes the options for New articles, New comments, and Series.</p><p></p><p>Registering for an account on Massage Planet takes no time at all. First, select a username and password. Then, enter your date of birth, location, and the type of massage you prefer. Your options are Shiatsu, Swedish, Reflexology, Reiki, Acupuncture, Hot stone, Thai massage, and Sport massage.</p><p></p><p>I'm sure you noticed that hand job isn't part of the list. Massage Planet can't make their true intentions too obvious, less The Man comes and tries to shut it down. The Man hates fun, and he never cums unless great suffering is involved.</p><p></p><p>Below the main menu are some currently featured ads on Massage Planet. It includes such hand job geniuses as Forever Spa, Purple List, Soul Relax Spa, Aroma Spa, Sparkling Spa, Top Day Spa, and Green Creek.</p><p></p><p>To the right of the featured sites is a tag cloud with shit like Asian, Available, Deep tissue, Full body, Mobile, Relaxation, and RMT.</p><p></p><p>Below the featured sites are rows of standard ads that seem to go on forever. Many include flash animation, and all are brightly colored.</p><p></p><p>However, it does stop eventually and leads into the shoutbox. This is where advertisers can keep Massage Planet users up to date on all the latest news.</p><p></p><p>For example, Spring Green has five girls on today. Everyone loves options. My Little House is rocking three ladies today: Kitty, Kandy, and Amy. Massage 555 has Punjabi lovelies on duty.</p><p></p><p>Another layer down is all the latest posts. This includes ads for massage parlors and requests from users. Such requests include looking for ebony sluts, and somebody asking if trump supporters already blew their load. Not sure why anyone would ask a bunch of horny betas on Massage Planet that question, but hey. It takes all kinds.</p><p></p><p>That brings us to Massage Planet chat. How lonely do you have to be to chat on a full-service massage parlor website? That's a new low. This isn't fucking FaceBook or IG. It's basically an escort site. Please meet friends elsewhere in life.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Educate Yourself</h3><p></p><p></p><p>The extensive front page continues with a list of Massage Planet reviews. As you can imagine, almost everyone has good things to say about the place. It's hard to argue with the results. When your balls are fully drained, what is there to complain about?</p><p></p><p>Finally, the last section of the Massage Planet front page is dedicated to the latest classifieds. If you frequent the site, this is the first thing you look up. I'd hate to see you fall behind and miss out on the freshest sluts.</p><p></p><p>It's unlikely you guys will ever convince a woman to fuck you. You'll have to pay if you want to get your dick jerked. <strong>Massage Planet is packed with inexpensive massage therapists ready to stroke you into paradise</strong>.</p><p></p><p>My only complaint about Massage Planet is all the flashy ads. It looks like shit and will probably give sensitive readers a fucking headache.</p><p></p><p>The perfect time to get jerked off is always now, so hop on Massage Planet this instant.</p>"}},{"id":"33613480edc6","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"33613480edc6","title":"SexAdvisor","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-29T00:00:00.000Z","description":"SexAdvisor.com is a website that looks very similar to TripAdvisor, but it is mainly introductory service places to find brothel strip club nightclub escort agencies, etc., and you can also view user review prices and other information.","canonical":"https://theporndude.com/zh/7320/sexadvisor","affiliate_url":"https://sexadvisor.com/","rating":5,"siteOrder":3,"price":"free","tags":[],"features":[],"categories":[{"id":"erotic-massage-sites","collection":"categories_en"},{"id":"best-escort-sites","collection":"categories_en"}],"screenshot_url":"https://cdn.staticstack.net/assets/img/r-thumbs/17f9617-sexadvisor_small.png","image_alt":"SexAdvisor, Erotic Massage Site","scraped_at":"2025-10-29T00:13:57.350Z","iconSpritesheet":"custom-favicon-spritesheet.png","iconPosition":"-112px -496px","iconClassName":"ctm-icon7320","logoIconClass":"icon7320","pros":["directory of brothels, strips clubs, nightclubs","instant venue picks near you","worldwide listings","rankings and reviews","registration is free but not required","comprehensive listings","minimal spam"],"cons":["not many reviews yet (new site)"],"detailedDescription":"<p>I spoke to my Sex Advisor this morning, and he told me I needed to get laid more often. Beating off into a silicone doll butthole while watching the porn tubes is great fun and all, but sometimes you need to stick your ding-ding inside of something live, wet, and tight. I guess I could try my luck at the local fatties on Tinder again, but what if I’m looking for something a little more, uh, professional?</p><p></p><p>That’s where SexAdvisor.com comes in. It’s a killer domain that’s been kicking around for decades, but its current incarnation is pretty fucking new to the Internet. You know, given the timing, I get the feeling the folks who built it are just as fed up with social distancing as the rest of us. <strong>The whole point of the site is to help you find brothels, erotic massages, strip clubs, swinger clubs, and other live, interactive adult entertainment</strong>. So let’s see if it’s time to end my dry spell.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Have You Spoken to a Sex Advisor Lately?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>How do I know it’s exhaustive? Because I recognize the places! They’ve got the strip clubs everybody expects, like the local Déjà vu and a handful of the grimier ones with a reputation for backroom fun, plus a nearby Asian massage parlor I’ve heard some rumors about. A notable omission is a recently shuttered “Adult Bookstore” that had a gross little glory hole where chubby middle-aged women sucked off strangers. That joint had been operating openly for years, and a lot of folks around here have said it was just a matter of time.</p><p></p><p>By default, SexAdvisor.com is showing you all the local venues. However, if you’ve got some specific entertainment in mind, you can dial in one of the options at the top of the list. They’ve got categories for Brothels, Erotic Massages, Nightclubs, FKK, Swinger Club, and Escort Agencies.</p><p></p><p>I wasn’t familiar with the term FKK, but Sex Advisor has included a helpful little summary of the philosophy. FKK is an abbreviation for a German word, Freikörperkultur, which translates to “free body culture.” It’s very similar to nudism, involving hanging out and doing day-to-day while entirely naked.</p><p></p><p>I’ve actually got a couple of famous nudist resorts within a couple of hours of me, so I expected to see them show up on the list as soon as I switched to the FKK view. Unfortunately, it looks like all the FKK locations they’ve got listed are in different European countries. I have to assume it’s due to some subtleties about the definition of FKK that I’m just not familiar with yet, or perhaps American nudism just doesn’t jive with the FKK philosophy. It could also be a result of the algorithms that have helped build the site; maybe the resort owners need to enter the info themselves.</p><p></p><p>While I am slightly disappointed those nudist camps weren’t on the list, I found out something nice about SexAdvisor.com: the site has thousands of clubs, agencies, and brothels listed worldwide. That worldwide listing means the site isn’t landlocked like a lot of similar directories, and you can use it from anywhere in the world. This will only get better as the site continues to grow.</p><p></p><p>The concept of FKK isn’t well-known in the United States, so it was helpful for Sex Advisor to include the write-up explaining the basics. And it isn’t just the FKK section, either, but each of the categories on the site, from the Brothels to the Erotic Massages to the Swinger Clubs, includes some basic information that will be helpful to newbies of these types of services.</p><p></p><p>At the end of the day, though, it’s up to you to make sure you’ve done your homework to stay safe while getting your dick wet. SexAdvisor is arguably a part of that homework, and this next section will explain another way the site’s so helpful in helping you pay for sex.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Reviews from Your Fellow Escort Bangers</h3><p></p><p></p><p>If you’ve spent much time here at MissAVDH, checking out my reviews of escort sites and directories, you probably already know how I feel about this feature. When I see a new escort site pop up without reviews, my first reaction is always, “What the fuck?” I don’t even buy penis growth cream without reading the reviews anymore, not after that nasty chemical burn incident. So why would you hit up a brothel you haven’t heard shit about? It could be a honey trap or just a wretched hive of scum and villainy.</p><p></p><p>The default view at SexAdvisor.com sorts the locations by proximity to you, but there are other ways to reshuffle the stack. For example, if you’re in a bigger city with plenty of options, you may be better off sorting the clubs by Popularity, Top Rated, or Discussed. This is a feature that is only going to improve as the site continues to mature.</p><p></p><p>The one downside to the review setup is that there aren’t many reviews yet as a very new site. Maybe that’s my cue to sign up for an account and start posting comments. <strong>Registration is free, but not required</strong>. I know a lot of you worry about leaving any kind of digital paper trail, but you don’t need to sign up for anything just to use the site if you ain’t going to leave reviews. Everything is visible without a membership, including all the contact info you’re going to need.</p><p></p><p>And it’s not just contact info, either; the brothel and club listings on SexAdvisor are surprisingly thorough, breaking down the hours, parking situation, and even prices. I really like the gallery photos, which will help you gauge the vibe when no reviews are available. You can tell a lot about a sex club by the lighting and the furniture, even though they usually take the shots when the joints are empty.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Like TripAdvisor, But Even More Useful</h3><p></p><p></p><p>The entire presentation has a professional vibe, and you know what? With my adblocker running, I didn’t even see any spam. That’s a rarity on any free site, especially one without a clear monetization strategy. I’m not sure where SexAdvisor.com is making their money, but I sure ain’t complaining.</p><p></p><p>Really, my biggest complaint about the site is just that it’s so fucking new. That means many of those review sections are still empty, waiting for some John to let us know about his experience with this escort agency, that swinger club, or the FKK establishment down the block. But, of course, as the site grows, those empty spaces will start to fill in, and the whole thing will get even more useful.</p><p></p><p>SexAdvisor.com is one of the nicer directories of brothels, agencies, and adult clubs I’ve seen in a while. It’s completely free to use and instantly shows you what’s available in your area, so I recommend a look even if you’re not actively trying to buy some pussy tonight. Who knows? You may end up having a better evening than you were expecting.</p>"}}]

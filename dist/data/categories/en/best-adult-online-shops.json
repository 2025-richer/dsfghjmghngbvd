Do you own a Flesh Light aka the best male masturbator yet? For many years now Fleshlights have been the most popular masturbation sex toy for men in the market. The ridiculously shaped Fleshlight is basically a flashlight with a fake pussy aka artificial vagina attached to the end, making it easy to hold as you fuck the shit out of it.</p><p></p><p>While the original model consisted of a pussy-flashlight toy, Flesh light has since expanded to many other products such as blowjob toys, dildos, pornstar-molded Fleshlights, and a whole lot of lube.</p><p></p><p>The products are generally high quality, with a price point that reflects that. When you feel the toys, you’ll see that the materials are made of flesh-like synthetic material, and the experience can be pretty goddamn real. Best of all, these Fleshlights are always feeling tight. No loose lips on these suckers.</p><p></p><p>Going into the history, the legendary Fleshlight was invented by Steve Shubin in 1998, who described it as “a device for discreet sperm collection.” That’s pretty fucking funny, not to mention true, since millions of men have busted a nut into these toys since it entered the market. The company started from his garage, but now has a big ass factory pumping these toys out 24/7 for your enjoyment.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>No-nonsense online store</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Below that will be the product gallery. Goddamn, has Fleshlight grown since I last checked it out over a decade ago. There are not only a ton of new Fleshlight products, but the site also focuses a lot on combo deals that include lube, washing liquid, and more. For the molded Fleshlights, you’ll also get a picture of the porn star that the Fleshlight is molded after so you can really know the pussy (or asshole) you’re fucking.</p><p></p><p>The main categories on the website include the products, best sellers, and a handy “What is Fleshlight?” FAQ. I think we all know what a Fleshlight is, so it was pretty funny to read a bunch of pages about how they painstakingly get the best molds and materials for that ultimate realistic feeling. Good on them!</p><p></p><p>Fleshlight.com also has an in-site currency called FleshBucks. FleshBucks are used to get discounted prices on the products. You can collect FleshBucks by promoting their website on social media avenues like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter.</p><p></p><p>Yeah…that’ a no for me dawg. I don’t need my mama finding out I’m buying fake vaginas, let alone advertising for them just to get a couple of bucks discount. But if you are strapped for cash and really horny, fuck it bro tell your friends! 100 FleshBucks equals $1, so you’ll be needing to do a lot of promoting.</p><p></p><p>Overall, the site’s layout is professional like any other boutique store. You also can read the site in Spanish. Finally, the website is mobile-friendly, and you won’t find any issues shopping on your smartphone for some prime plastic pussy.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>How many fake vaginas can they make?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Diving into the products, we got the classic Fleshlight, Quickshots, Stamina Training Units, Turbo, Anal Toys, and a lot more. We already talked about the Fleshlight, so let’s go into these new state of the art toys.</p><p></p><p>The Quickshot is a Fleshlight except that it has an opening on the other side. This lets you bust a nut into a napkin, or someone’s face, making the cleanup way easier. Stamina Training Units are special Fleshlights that try to help you build stamina. It’s like lifting weights; the more you practice, the better you get. Finally, Anal Toys are….well…toys for your anus, my friend.</p><p></p><p>Fleshlight also has products for gayboys, mostly in the form of dildo molds of male pornstars that you can stick up your ass or in your mouth. Must feel weird as a male pornstar knowing that thousands of men all over the world are sticking dildos up their ass shaped just like your pecker, but for me, it’s just hilarious.</p><p></p><p>There’s also a section for women, which include dildos, beads, and Kegel balls. All the toys are waterproof and easy to clean, so don’t worry about that pussy juice getting all swampy on the toys. You might want to pick up some cleaning solution though.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>What I Like</h3><p></p><p></p><p>There is a reason why Fleshlights have become the #1 adult toy, and it’s not just because of the catchy name. The product quality is solid, and the designers worked hard to create the best mold and material to give you that real pussy feel. Once they get these toys to make pussy juice, it’s fucking over. No need for you any more ladies!</p><p></p><p>It’s also cool that they have plenty of products for the bitches. This is important because if you have a girlfriend and get caught browsing this site, you can just make the excuse that you were looking for shit to buy her. Okay, that probably won’t work, but you might get points for trying…</p><p></p><p>Overall, I’m glad they haven’t just been sitting on their ass since I last checked them out many years ago. There are so many new products, and I’m sure that the newer models feel way better than they did back then. I also like that they have Fleshlights for anal and mouth, instead of just the vag.</p><p></p><p>Finally, I like that Fleshlight cares about personal improvement. The Stamina Training Unit (STU) is a Fleshlight designed to help you last longer in bed. This is simply by making the STU extra tight and sensitive, so you’ll bust a nut real fucking quick if you don’t take your training seriously. Edging is a good way to train on these motherfuckers.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>What I hate</h3><p></p><p></p><p>As for the products, I will tell you that Fleshlights are not the most realistic products I found in the market (although they are very good). If you want a realistic experience with the Fleshlight, I recommend you buy a warmer that warms that shit up before you use it. I also read that the Mini Lotus sleeve can be good for a realistic experience.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Suggestions</h3><p></p><p></p><p>First, I think the website should have some porn. You are a goddamn sex toy site, so act like it and have some eye candy for your shoppers. I get that the site wants to maintain its work-safe status, probably so degenerates can shop while at the office, but some porno could really motivate a man to click that purchase button.</p><p></p><p>The website should also have some guides or user manuals for download. The main guide it should have is “how to clean your Fleshlight”. Think about it, you are jizzing right into the goddamn toy. Do you think that shit cleans itself?</p><p></p><p>You keep cumming into a Fleshlight without cleaning it up, sooner or later you are going to have some mutant bacteria babies growing out of that motherfucker. Stay clean!</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Still one of the greatest</h3><p></p><p></p><p>When it comes to sex toys, I preferred the Japanese brands like Onahole, but it looks like Fleshlight has really stepped up their game. The Fleshlight product lineup increased a lot, and the product reviews talk about a much more realistic experience than they had years ago when the plastic was harder and felt faker.</p><p></p><p>If you haven’t fucked in a while and are tired of using your left hand, you should check out Fleshlight.com. The best part of Fleshlight (often misspelled as \"fleshlite\") is that the toys don’t talk back, let alone constantly spending your cash. One day, we will have robot sex doll slaves, but until then, Fleshlights aren’t a bad way to get your nut off.</p>"}},{"id":"23af9cd07921","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"23af9cd07921","title":"BrazzersToys","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"BrazzersToys.com offers high-quality sex toys curated by world-renowned obscene dealers for perverted gadgets for men, women and couples","canonical":"https://theporndude.com/zh/17937/brazzerstoys","affiliate_url":"https://brazzerstoys.com/?ats=eyJhIjoxNzYsImMiOjI3OTcwMTcsIm4iOjEzOCwicyI6NzEwLCJlIjoxMDc2NCwicCI6Mn0%3D&atc=Autocampaign_Default","rating":4,"siteOrder":6,"price":"free","tags":[],"features":[],"categories":[{"id":"best-adult-online-shops","collection":"categories_en"}],"screenshot_url":"https://cdn.staticstack.net/assets/img/r-thumbs/248f2d0-brazzerstoys_small.png","image_alt":"BrazzersToys, Sex Toys Store","scraped_at":"2025-10-28T18:01:51.102Z","iconSpritesheet":"default","logoIconClass":"icon552","pros":["sex toy shop curated by brazzers","a wide selection of male, female and couples toys from various manufacturers","free shipping ($75 minimum order required)","hundreds of adult products","$30 brazzers-branded fleshlight knockoff"],"cons":["smaller catalog than some internet sex toy shops"],"detailedDescription":"<p>When I first heard of Brazzers Toys, I knew it could go one of two ways. I’ve seen adult sites trying to piggyback off the famous names of their competitors, so I half wondered if this was going to be another shop misrepresenting their origin story. On the other hand, if the big-name brand was actually hawking their own sex toys, it could spell great times for masturbators. After all, who knows jacking off better than one of the world’s most popular smut peddlers?</p><p></p><p>Turns out, this ain’t some half-baked drop-shipping operation with a stolen title. <strong>BrazzersToys.com offers a selection of masturbatory gizmos curated by the legendary porn makers themselves</strong>. The shop has been getting about 25,000 visitors a month lately, which got me curious. A name like Brazzers is going to bring in the perverts, no matter what they’re selling, but did the catalog live up to the hype? Read on, and I’ll tell you what I found inside.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Masturbation Toys from the Porno Giant</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Not that there’s any mistaking BrazzersToys.com for a SFW e-commerce website. Beneath a logo that tacks a TOYS onto the original two-tone BRAZZERS insignia, a blonde, fishnet-clad pornstar makes an oh-face while arching her back, showing off that peach. It’s a page-top promotion for their selection of backdoor toys, “from notice to pro,” with a little pic of a vibrating butt plug just in case you’re a little too slow to glean it from the way she’s got her ass in the air.</p><p></p><p>Given how many top-tier pornstars Brazzers has featured in their movies, I was really hoping to find some Brazzers Toys based on a few, similar to all those Fleshlights modeled after real starlets. Maybe those are coming down the pipeline at some point, but for now, the licensed pornstar products in the catalog are made by other companies. They do have a growing selection of Brazzers-branded gadgets, though. The newest include electronic cock rings, Money Shot masturbators and an air-pulse clit stimulator for ladies looking to hose down the living room with pussy juice.</p><p></p><p>Only a handful of the current toys have a yellow Brazzers label on the box. <strong>They’re carrying products for men, women and couples from a range of adult toymakers</strong>. Genital stimulators from outfits like Main Squeeze, PDX, Gender X and Fantasy can be found in abundance, and there are even toys like Creature Cocks for the hentai nerds and bona fide deviates in the audience. Brazzers the porn site caters to pretty typical fap fantasies, but BrazzersToys carries a wide enough range of kinky items that even the deep-niche fetishists can get their kicks, too.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I did notice, though, that some of the biggest, most well-known adult toy brands ain’t featured in the catalog. It’s hard to review a site like this without mentioning the ubiquitous Fleshlight a dozen times, but BrazzersToys.com doesn’t carry them. A lot of masturbators will tell you brand names don’t matter too much unless you’re just trying to spend more money, and I agree with that to a certain extent. That said, brand recognition is valuable, if only because we’re all more likely to buy something from a maker we’re already familiar with.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Digging into the Brazzers Toys Catalog</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Case in point, that Brazzers Money Shot Premium Male Masturbator I mentioned earlier, which is currently the top Featured item in the ZZ Toys aisle. At $130, it ain’t the cheapest auto-fapper on the market nor the most expensive, hovering somewhere between the no-name brands and more expensive manufacturers like Tenga. It’s sleek-looking motherfucker, though, a visual upgrade from the usual cap-ended “flashlights” and low-quality plastic imitators. With 10 speeds and 3 suction modes, I’m kind of considering adding yet another auto-stroker to my collection.</p><p></p><p>BrazzersToys.com also has girl toys that are just as premium, including their own version of the beloved Hitachi Magic Wand for eighty bones and a vibrating rabbit dildo for ten bucks more. You can buy your wife a bottle of Brazzers Pre-Flex Deep Throat Spray for $15, and maybe she’ll even use it if you also treat her to their remote-controlled panty vibe. A lot of people think of sex toys as things to enjoy strictly solo, but man, you can have so much fun with a partner and a little something that buzzes like an insect. Check out some of my toy tests at MissAVDHCasting if you don’t believe me!</p><p></p><p>One item that I really want to point out to readers is the $30 Brazzers-branded Fleshlight knockoff. It’s got a non-descript fuck hole instead of fake vagina, and the suction control valve isn’t as sophisticated as the pressure control of the big-name competitor, but for the price, I certainly ain’t complaining. This is already one of the best sex toy deals I’ve seen in years, but it gets even better: it comes with a 30-day membership to Brazzers. The Ultimate Stroker Cup costs almost the same exact amount as the subscription, so it’s basically like getting a free (imitation) Fleshlight when you sign up for Brazzers.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Do I Really Need Another Toy? Probably.</h3><p></p><p></p><p><strong>That includes hundreds of adult toys in all shapes, sizes, colors and styles</strong>. By the numbers, there are nearly 300 products in the For Him section and another couple hundred For Her. There are mere dozens of items listed in sections like For Couples, Anal Play, and Dildos, but the Vibrator aisle does span more than two hundred products.</p><p></p><p>The lube section is surprisingly well-stocked, reminding me of the vast selection you find on Japanese onahole websites. BrazzersToys carries around 60 slippery substances with different textures, smells and topical anesthetics for your bunghole. An 8-ounce bottle of Fuck Sauce Anal Numbing Lubricant is much pricier than the usual fake pre-cum and simulated pussy juice at $35, but as the product description says, “everything’s better with sauce on it, especially your ass.”</p><p></p><p>Whatever you decide to spring for, <strong>shipping is free as long as you spend at least $75</strong>. You might end up paying a few more bucks for your package if you’re only getting one cheapo toy like that Ultimate Stroker Cup I mentioned, but it really ain’t hard to hit that minimum order around here. Toy-cleaning fluid starts at around ten bucks and lubes around $15, so just add some juice to your order if you’re getting close to that free-shipping threshold.</p><p></p><p>I’m impressed. Given their lineage, Brazzers Toys could have just slapped their name on some bullshit, called it a day, and still made a fucking shitload of money. Instead, it seems like they really are curating a collection of some of the better sex toys out there, just like they lay it out on the About Us page. While the selection at BrazzersToys.com might not run quite as deep as those internet sex-toy superstores, you have a lot less worry about buying a scratchy fap sleeve that doesn’t live up to the hype and gives you an infection. Just like they’ve done with their award-winning video website, Brazzers remains committed to helping their fans bring their fap sessions to the next level.

My whole thing is giving out hints as to where you can find the fap fodder of your wettest dreams, but the website I’ll be checking out today ain’t another video archive or nudie photo gallery to shake your dick at. No, this next joint will help you get your rocks off in much more physical ways than just a friendly nudge in the right direction.</p><p></p><p><strong>PornHint.com is an online sex shop hawking lingerie, adult toys and accessories for grownups of all genders and orientations</strong>. They’ve been online for barely over a year, but they’re already pulling an impressive volume of traffic, with well over 100,000 visitors stopping by last month. I’m always looking for ways to spice up my daily fap tests while I review online porn, as well as toys to share with my guests on MissAVDHCasting couch, so I couldn’t wait to peruse the selection. Let’s see what we can find, shall we?</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Anybody Need a Porn Hint?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>A lot of adult toy retailers have a particular focus, whether that’s buzzy gizmos for ladies, high-end dick strokers for dudes, or BDSM restraints for couples to punish and reward each other with. So many sites focus almost exclusively on realistic sex dolls that I’ve given them their own separate rankings and reviews here at MissAVDH. PornHint.com, on the other hand, takes such an everything-goes approach that I’m probably not going to be able to mention everything.</p><p></p><p>They’ve got it all, my friends. They’ve got dildos, vibrators, fap sleeves and automated cock suckers in all shapes, sizes and colors. They’ve got realistic high-end sex dolls, penis pumps and enlargers, butt plugs and those thrusting, pounding, jackhammering fuck machines you see in pornos and on webcams. I’ve reviewed a lot of these websites, and I don’t recall ever seeing an aisle of “Love Machines” anywhere else. I kind of thought they were all homemade.</p><p></p><p><strong>Porn Hint also has a very extensive collection of sexy clothing for women</strong>. A spread of featured lingerie is one of the first things you’ll see upon loading their front page, along with nipple clamp jewelry and the kind of slingshot bikinis that Borat wears, though the models here are way hotter. There are also whole sections of crotchless lingerie, leggings, and booty-enhancing shapewear.</p><p></p><p>I was surprised by the overall range of the PornHint catalog, but I think Sex Furniture was the most unexpected section. They’ve got all kinds of kinky furniture like sex swings, breeding stands, queening chairs, pillories, punishment bucks, some elaborate rocking chairs costing thousands, and yes, even a couple variations on the St. Andrew’s Cross for tying up your lover spread eagle. I tend to associate these big-ass, high-dollar items with specialty BDSM retailers, so it’s really noteworthy to see them in what’s shaping up to be the Amazon of sex toy shops.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Free Shipping, Price Matching and Other Perks</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Another unexpected perk is their 110% best-price guarantee, which ensures you pay the lowest price for any sex toy they’ve got in stock. If you find a BDSM anal hook on PornHint that’s $10 cheaper on another site, you get $11 off the price. Honestly, I don’t care that much about ten bones, but the price-matching can really come in handy with more expensive items like life-size sex dolls or that sex furniture I talked about.</p><p></p><p>Are you going to find lower prices elsewhere, though? <strong>One of the things that struck me as I browsed the catalog was how cheap some of these items are</strong>. They’ve got realistic artificial asses for well under a hundo, wearable auto-thrusting men’s strokers for under $40, and sexy panties starting at around ten bucks. I made the Amazon comparison a couple paragraphs ago, and I’m really starting to wonder if Porn Hint’s low pricing is related to the sheer volume of products they carry.</p><p></p><p>Porn Hint runs a lot of promos, so be sure to check out the current banners out front if you’re looking to really maximize your bang per buck ratio. As I type this up, they’re doing a Flash Sale with up to 30% off on sex doll butts, torsos, and whole-ass fake ladies. There’s a full-sized, big-eyed, purple-haired anime sex doll going for just under $400 right now, and she’d make the perfect waifu for a lot of weebs out there. It might be time to ask mom to raise your allowance, at least for this month.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>WTF Is Up with These Reviews?</h3><p></p><p></p><p><strong>PornHint.com lets customers leave reviews</strong>, giving me a little more incentive to pick this chick up. She’s got a 5-star rating based on ten reviews, which sounds great, but I started getting skeptical once I actually started reading them.</p><p></p><p>There’s some weirdness to the reviews on the site that makes me doubt their authenticity. For one thing, everybody is using their full name, first and last. That’s weird on any ecommerce site, let alone a sex toy shop. At least half the names are female, which is even weirder when we’re talking high-end sex dolls, a market notoriously dominated by lonely men. Almost all the reviews are five stars, too, and a ton of them have broken English and weird syntax.</p><p></p><p>Wow. Maybe this really is the Amazon.com of sex toy shops. I don’t doubt that their products are great, fapworthy and fuckable, as they’re largely made my known and respected brands, but some of these reviews feel pretty sketchy. This ain’t uncommon around the web, and it ain’t always the fault of the website itself. As on Amazon, fake reviews are often posted by the manufacturers and wholesalers. My advice is to take reviews anywhere with a grain of salt. User reviews with original photos are the most trustworthy anywhere, and thankfully, you’ll find some of them here.</p><p></p><p>I’m really bummed about the potentially fake reviews, because they’re really the only negative element I found during my visit today. Everything else was impressive, from the insane range of products, to the free shipping and price guarantee, to the low pricing. I ended up doing some homework on Google to see if anybody’s had a bad experience with PornHint, but couldn’t find anything suspicious; they’re a legit company.

Do you want to buy some hentai shit at J List? Sometimes it is not enough to simply watch hours and hours of porn. Sometimes you need a little more than that. A little something special. Something to really step your self-pleasure game up a notch. Hey, there ain’t nothing wrong with using a tool every now and then right? No judgment here.</p><p></p><p>Plus, with Christmas right around the corner, why not treat yourself to something nice? Splurge a little. Splurge on your splooge, that’s what I say. You deserve it! … Okay, maybe you don’t really deserve it, seeing as all you do all day every day is sit around your mother’s basement watching porn and fapping like it is going out of fashion … But, still, you might as well make the most of that time.</p><p></p><p>In the world of adult sex toys and merchandise, it can be somewhat of a difficult task to find stuff geared specifically toward straight men. It seems like everywhere you go, it’s vibrators, dildos, and anal beads. But what about us? It is not quite as easy to find, say, a quality pocket pussy, a BJ simulator, or a blowup doll.</p><p></p><p>Plus, there definitely seems to be something of a double standard when it comes to who can and cannot enjoy sex toys. A prime example of this is to take a look at how a girl having a dildo or a vibrator is sexy, but a dude with a blowup doll? Well, society has deemed that pathetic. Whether or not it actually is pathetic is a completely different conversation.</p><p></p><p>Have you ever actually tried going to a brick and mortar sex toy shop and asking someone to point you toward the blowup dolls? Well, probably not. Because that would involve going to a public place and admitting, in front of a group of random and unwitting strangers that you—yes, you, the neckbeard in the fedora and Star Trek shirt—are in the market for a blowup doll. Way to reinforce the stereotype, asshole.</p><p></p><p>Even more difficult, I would imagine, is for guys who love hentai and Japanese porn to find sex toys specifically geared toward them. And, as we have already established, since you are the neckbeard/fedora guy, we both know that you love anime porn and have a strange (yet, on some levels, totally understandable) obsession with Japanese chicks.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>A Japanese Sex Shop for Americans</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Just follow the natural line of logic: if you want Japanese sex toys and products, well, go to a Japanese store. Makes sense, right? What’s more, there are some decent Japanese sex shops for you to get all of your fap gadgets under the cloak of anonymity that is the internet. And just like that, boom, problem solved. You’re welcome.</p><p></p><p>So, you acne-riddled 4chan lurker, I present to you J-List: an all-Japanese online marketplace. Although they sell many products (think of it almost like an anime-oriented Japanese Amazon seemingly geared toward Western consumers), since you can’t go five minutes without fapping (or at least thinking about fapping), my review will focus only on one small corner of the site: The Adult Corner.</p><p></p><p>Once you get to J-List’s Adult Corner, you might notice that the site design and layout is actually kind of similar to that of a porn site. What caught my eye first is the banner at the top of the page, which is a simple gray box with “Adult Corner” written in a very plain script. To the left of it, though, you will find an 18+ Japanese schoolgirl who is standing up, effortlessly stretching her right leg straight above her head. It’s kind of amazing, to be honest, and definitely prime for putting a perverted mind in the right headspace for the kind of shopping that is in store.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Familiar, Easy to Use Site Design</h3><p></p><p></p><p>To the left of the products, also not unlike a porn site, will be a few options to filter your results. Shop by category (adult magazines, toys, videos, cast-off figures, eroge, hentai anime, manga, and 42 others), tick a box to control whether you see pre-order items or not, select a price range ($3 - $360), filter for specific series, and filter by theme (amateur, school, sports, tentacle / monster, etc.). Overall, I am pretty impressed with the number and effectiveness of the features that J-List offers in order to help you browse their mass of products.</p><p></p><p>Okay, so, now that you have filtered out all the stuff you don’t give a fuck about and you’ve narrowed it down to whatever weird tentacle-themed shit you’re into, let’s click into a product page and see what JList has to offer. Well, it seems pretty on par with most decent online stores. You get a few images of the product, an “Add to Cart” button, an “Add to Wishlist” feature, you have the options to quickly share the product on social media (please don’t), and it displays whether the product is in stock and where it ships from (Japan in almost every case).</p><p></p><p>You’ll also get an in-depth product description written by the people of J-List (as opposed to the manufacturer), the item’s specs (weight, length, etc.), a link to find similar products, as well as an easy link to the manufacturer’s website (a nice touch). The featured images, I feel like I should note, may not always provide the most accurate depiction of the item, though.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Lack of True Photos and Customer Voice</h3><p></p><p></p><p>This is disappointing for obvious reasons. If I’m going to drop $180 on a sex toy (not that I ever would, but for the sake of argument…) then I better be able to see multiple unadulterated photos of exactly what I can expect to receive in the mail. Videos, too, would be helpful, so that I can see if the product is sturdy enough, to ensure the materials aren’t too cheap. For almost $200, I’m going to need a hell of a lot more than a few artist’s renderings of what I’m buying.</p><p></p><p>Another disappointing aspect of J-List is that they do not seem to have any sort of customer rating or review system in place. They do review products themselves, though, and link to those reviews (which are published on their blog). But, come on. Am I supposed to just trust that J-List is going to give me an honest review of an item that they are clearly trying to sell? Obviously, they’re not going to say, “this product is a piece of shit,” even if it is. They’re trying to make money!</p><p></p><p>On a positive note, though, they do have a system in place for private ordering, so that you can feel safe buying whatever sort of perverse monster porn shit you like without anyone becoming any the wiser. No need for your mom to find a package on the porch that clearly reads “LOLLIPOP MISTY NIGHTMARE GIRL 2-WAY ONAHOLE SEX DOLL.” The catch? They charge you five bucks extra for this anonymous service as an add-on at checkout. That’s fucked up, but it’s a great business move to be honest.</p><p></p><p>All in all, J List has tons of obscure Japanese sex toys, hentai, manga, anime, and other shit to choose from. If you just want a simple pocket pussy or fuck torso, I’d probably go to Amazon, frankly. However, if you are in need of some hard-to-find hentai or manga, or you absolutely need a weird hentai sex toy that can’t be found in a Western online shop, I’m sure J-List will come through.</p><p></p><p>Either way, happy fapping. And shave your fucking neckbeard already. Maybe if you did you wouldn’t need to be buying fuck torsos anonymously on the internet!</p>"}},{"id":"6920fad024c3","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"6920fad024c3","title":"SVAKOM","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"Svakom.com's stylish, high-tech masturbation device is more affordable than other similar products.

They’re golden once they’re established, as nobody’s going to confuse an outfit like Brazzers, LiveJasmin or Beeg with a similar-sounding website. The thing is, reaching that level of recognition is going to be hard for smaller brands with these kinds of non-descriptive titles. I called my website MissAVDH so you’d know exactly what you were going to get, but what do you even expect when you hear a word like Svakom?</p><p></p><p>Spoiler alert: <strong>they’re hawking high-tech sex toys that won’t break the bank</strong>. That was the mission when Svakom.com was founded in 2012, and it’s still the case today. As for my musings on the ambiguous branding, well, the name doesn’t seem to be hurting them. In fact, their traffic has nearly quadrupled recently, with well over a hundred thousand visitors stopping by last month. I didn’t have half this much interest when I launched my line of official MissAVDH cheese dildos, but maybe I’ll learn a thing or two about slanging sex toys once I dig into the site a little more.</p><p></p><p>Oh, and while I know you’re here for the opinion of the world’s most famous professional masturbator, it’s worth noting that I ain’t the only one singing Svakom’s praises. In 2023, they won the XBiz Award for Luxury Brand of the Year, the XBiz Europa Award for Global Pleasure Brand of the year, and the EroSpain Award for Toy Brand of the Year. I’d get into their older accolades, but I’ve only got so much time!</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Like Dildo Shopping in the Future</h3><p></p><p></p><p>To the contrary, this joint is sparkly clean and well-polished. The thin, sleek letters of the Svakom logo remind me of Sephora, as do the color scheme and overall presentation. The photography is straight out of a fashion magazine, showing sexy models posing with their toys instead of the generic stock photos of happy people you often find elsewhere. It’s clear they’ve put real time, energy and money into every element of the website, and I haven’t even touched on the actual toys yet.</p><p></p><p>I already mentioned this in the intro, but this is a point worth quoting their About Us page for. “Svakom was created as a means of offering high-quality products to the world with an emphasis on innovative technology and affordability.” I honestly would have guessed this just based on my familiarity with these types of products. <strong>The gizmos out front look as sleek and high-tech as some of the fancier brands out there, but without the prohibitively high price tags</strong>.</p><p></p><p>No shit, my dudes, Svakom.com has best-selling automated dick strokers starting at under a hundo. While these gadgets have come down in recent years, you can easily pay twice that or more for a similar device from a major brand. A few of their female-oriented best sellers are going for under $50, and I ain’t talking about the generic vibrating bullets you find at the porn store; these are futuristic gizmos you’d assume were designed by Apple if they came in bright, blinding white.</p><p></p><p>Sex-related industries often get a bad rep from the prudes of the world, but environmentally minded masturbators should check out Svakom’s Sustainability page. They’re planting trees, recycling packaging, supporting farmers and helping people get clean water. The next time your mom says you ain’t doing any good just sitting around and jacking off all day, tell her to check out the website. “I’m saving the world here, mom! Can you grab me a towel?”</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Plug Your Dick in Here, and Then Plug into the Internet</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Since there are no sections aimed at either men or women, I first checked out <strong>Svakom’s line of interactive, app-controlled adult toys called the Connexion Series</strong>. I’m honestly kind of shocked by how cheap the lower-end interactive units run, with female pulse stimulators starting at $39. At the other end of the spectrum, their $179 Alex Neo is a powerful thrusting masturbator and the most expensive among the line. It’s currently sold out, giving you an idea of its popularity.</p><p></p><p>If you’ve cranked it to webcam sex sites, you’ve probably seen women using similar devices; the pink, internet-connected Lovense vibrators are very popular right now. Svakom.com’s got some video tutorials to guide you through the connection process with their gadgets, and these things ain’t limited to buzzes from viewers. You can also experience the fucking and sucking of your favorite porn movies, all synced up so it’s like you’re living it. Combine it with a VR headset and you may never leave the house again.</p><p></p><p>Their Sam Neo is a cheaper variation of the priciest male Svakom toy I mentioned above, with automatic sucking and vibration. It’s currently on sale for $83.99, which I think is the lowest cost of entry for a male masturbator that can sync up with porno movies. I’m whipping up this review a couple weeks from Valentine’s day, but the price ain’t going to go up much after the seasonal discount. Maybe I better put an order in before they sell out…</p><p></p><p></p><h3>And a Little Something for the Ladies</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Svakom doesn’t sell highly realistic, veiny dildos, but they do have some classic-looking female toys: the vaguely penile shapes, the rabbits and the curved, wearable vibrators. I’m slightly more intrigued by their next-generation designs that might not immediately look like something designed to give you an orgasm. The Pulse Lite Neo looks like something you’d buy at the headshop 50 years from now, and the Pulse Pure is a palm-sized bit of modern art that can also make a woman cum.</p><p></p><p>I took a closer look at the listing for that latter product. Svakom.com calls their Pulse Pure a Deep Pulse Clitoral Stimulator, and sells that bad boy for just under eighty bones. It comes in two colors, charges in 3 hours and buzzes for 4, and has 5 vibration modes and intensity levels.</p><p></p><p>Users love it, too. Like any good ecommerce website, Svakom lets customers leave reviews. These days it’s a bad sign if there’s no review section, but I found a lot of happy consumers around here. A chick named Cassie said the Pulse Pure was the “Most efficient toy I’ve ever had. Like, instant orgasms.” If that scares you as a dude, I recommend buying your gal a vibrator and helping her play with it. Trust me on this.</p><p></p><p>At the end of the day, it’s up to you what you’re going to buzz your cooter, your weewee or your bunghole with. There’s a lot of personal preference at play that may not line up precisely with my experience or that of the customers leaving reviews, just like with porno. What I can say about Svakom.com is that they’re one of the more affordable sites I’ve reviewed who specialize in high-tech masturbation devices. If you’re looking for a truly next-level, next-generation masturbation experience but don’t want to open a new credit card, these guys are definitely worth a look.</p>"}},{"id":"34ba1737d0a3","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"34ba1737d0a3","title":"Onahole","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"Onahole.com is a well-designed, well-stocked online store for authentic Japanese imported Hentai sex toys for Western horny cartoon porn lovers","canonical":"https://theporndude.com/zh/12600/onahole","affiliate_url":"https://www.onahole.com?aff=33","rating":4,"siteOrder":10,"price":"free","tags":[],"features":[],"categories":[{"id":"best-adult-online-shops","collection":"categories_en"},{"id":"best-premium-hentai-sites","collection":"categories_en"}],"screenshot_url":"https://cdn.staticstack.net/assets/img/r-thumbs/505a731-onahole_small.png","image_alt":"Onahole, sex toy store","scraped_at":"2025-10-28T18:02:27.482Z","iconSpritesheet":"custom-favicon-spritesheet.png","iconPosition":"-304px -608px","iconClassName":"ctm-icon12600","logoIconClass":"icon12600","pros":["a varied collection of japanese-imported hentai sex toys that will cater to every taste","a great range of written content on the site’s blog, about page, and faq section","it has various positive reviews from previous clients proudly on display"],"cons":["it lacks a translation plugin to switch the site’s language"],"detailedDescription":"<p>Over the years, we’ve seen a dramatic shift in the world of porn consumption. Sure, there are plenty of people who are happy to watch a generic porno with zero storylines and merely enjoy the sight of a dripping wet pussy or a quivering asshole being fucked into submission in complete 4K. Still, there are others seeking something with more depth, storyline, and characters with enough personality that you can immerse yourself in them.</p><p></p><p>Regarding the latter type of smut, most people opt for Hentai. This form of cartoon porn originated in Japan and often centers around some truly wild XXX storylines and themes that the conventional porn industry couldn’t dream of pulling off. Worldwide, Hentai has boomed in popularity with a fuck load of websites popping up to cater to the growing demand.</p><p></p><p>But while Hentai can provide cutting-edge storylines and levels of taboo you may never have seen before, people can still become somewhat desensitized to it over time. After all, it’s not like you can fuck the erotic characters getting fucked on the page or screen in front of you, is it? Wrong!</p><p></p><p>Just as the mainstream porn industry has lifelike replicas of iconic pornstar pussies in the form of the iconic Fleshlight, so does the Hentai scene! There’s no shortage of websites providing authentic Hentai-themed sex toys to help fans of the genre bring their cartoon porn journey to life in some of the wildest ways imaginable.</p><p></p><p>But if you’re going to slide your dick into the most realistic thing to a Hentai pussy, you should go hard or go home. By this, I mean investing in Hentai sex toys that have come from the homeland of the smut genre; Japan!</p><p></p><p>But MissAVDH! I don’t live anywhere near Japan, nor do I speak the language. How am I supposed to wander around Tokyo looking for Hentai sex toys? I hear you ask. Well, you don’t have to because there’s an increasing number of online sex shops based in the West that import most of their inventory from Japan and provide easy shipping to places like Europe, the U.S., and Canada.</p><p></p><p>However, not all of these Hentai sex toy stores are created equally, and some of them can claim to be the best and most authentic on the market when they’re the complete opposite in reality. It’s my job to help guide you to the great stores while helping you avoid the worst. Today, my mission takes me to an online Hentai sex store called Onahole.com.</p><p></p><p>This site claims to offer some of the best Japanese sex toys to the Hentai community and help them to bring their cartoon porn adventures to life. But are their claims true to the Bushido code? Or is it just a marketing gimmick? Let’s find out!</p><p></p><p></p><h3>What is Onahole.com</h3><p></p><p></p><p>If you check out the site’s history via internet archive websites, you can see its domain can be traced back to 2005. However, the current form of the website is much more recent, making it somewhat of a newcomer to the world of Hentai sex toys.</p><p></p><p>Now, I’ve sprawled my collection of Hentai comics out in front of me, and I’m ready for a jerk-off session that’ll send tremors across Japan. But does Onahole.com have the kind of sex toys to help make my Hentai masturbation experience as good as possible? Let’s find out as we delve into their product portfolio!</p><p></p><p></p><h3>What are the Hentai Sex Toys like on Onahole.com?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>●&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Succubus sole Foot fuck! - Because Fleshlights are for normies! This bizarre sex toy is a dream come true for foot fetishists and features a lifelike female foot with a realistic pussy embedded in the sole. This is reserved for people who love feet so much that they want to slide their cock deep inside them!</p><p>●&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Otokonoko Shemale - So, you want to bring your Futanari Hentai fantasies to life, but you’re limited on space? Look no further than the Otokonoko Shemale mini sex doll! This portable sex doll features all the best features of a Futanari shemale in the form of thick thighs, plump tits, and a giant cock, without space-taking parts like a head, arms, and legs!</p><p>● Nezuko's Double Tooth Blowjob - Ever wondered what it’d feel like to slide your cock into the fanged mouth of a horny vampire slut? This Nezuko blowjob toy lets you experience it in all of its glory! This Fleshlight-like toy is an oblong blowjob simulator complete with the vampiric teeth held behind the lips and is a perfect accompaniment to your favorite vampire Hentai porn!</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Design of the Site</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Below this is the main menu which begins with a professional-looking logo and runs into a main menu comprising four links leading to their product categories, best-selling toys, sex toy guides, and an About page detailing the site’s mission and background. This is underlined by four selling points of the site ranging from free shipping and a 14-day return policy to their discreet packaging and a secure payment system.</p><p></p><p>The site's homepage is crowned by a well-designed hero section featuring some NSFW Hentai art and is decorated with the text, ‘’Satisfy your Hentai desires’’. Below are featured images taking you to some of the most popular sex toy categories, followed by a portfolio of some of the site’s most popular products available for sale.</p><p></p><p>Further down is a sign-up box for people to be added to the site’s email list, followed by an eye-catching portfolio of the latest customer reviews. This leads to a decent array of written content on the site’s dedicated blog and FAQ section.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>What I Like Most About it</h3><p></p><p></p><p>I also respect how much-written content the admins have uploaded to the site. I’ve reviewed a lot of online sex stores, and so many of them lack a blog and an about page. Onahole.com, on the other hand, has a well-written blog packed with some beneficial articles and a dedicated About page showcasing what the site is all about.</p><p></p><p>Any website can make bold claims about being the best Hentai sex toy website without backing it up, but Onahole.com goes a step further and proudly displays its positive customer reviews on its homepage to reinforce that it’s able to carry out its promises of providing authentic Japanese sex toys to a Hentai-loving audience.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>What I Don’t Like</h3><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Suggestions I Have for Onahole.com</h3><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Overall, this is a well-designed website with a collection of imported sex toys from Japan that is varied enough to keep it exciting, and it’s a site well worth checking out for any Hentai porn lover who wants to make their porn experience far more realistic. The only downside? There’s no translation feature to switch the site from English to other languages.</p>"}},{"id":"b4ffe818c883","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"b4ffe818c883","title":"MotsuToys","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"MotsuToys.com is a sex toy store designed for men","canonical":"https://theporndude.com/zh/12640/motsutoys","affiliate_url":"https://www.motsutoys.com/?ref=nzk5mzq","rating":4,"siteOrder":11,"price":"free","tags":[],"features":[],"categories":[{"id":"best-adult-online-shops","collection":"categories_en"},{"id":"best-premium-hentai-sites","collection":"categories_en"}],"screenshot_url":"https://cdn.staticstack.net/assets/img/r-thumbs/388190b-motsutoys_small.png","image_alt":"MotsuToys, Sex Toys Store","scraped_at":"2025-10-28T18:02:34.490Z","iconSpritesheet":"custom-favicon-spritesheet.png","iconPosition":"-400px -608px","iconClassName":"ctm-icon12640","logoIconClass":"icon12640","pros":["outstanding resource for amazing sex toys","over 50 sex dolls","discreet shipping","a sex shop for just men"],"cons":["nothing"],"detailedDescription":"<p>Motsu Toys!

When your old pal MissAVDH tells you he had to check a website because of some rumors he heard, it’s a safe bet those rumors involve massive, body quaking orgasms. The question today is just who is going to get those mind-blowing big O’s; will it be you, your girlfriend, or the both of you at the same time?</p><p></p><p>I’ve got a couple dozen online sex toy shops ranked and reviewed here at MissAVDH, and I’ll tell you right now RoseToy-Official.com is something of an outlier in the industry. Most of the companies coming up with brand-new masturbation gadgets are aiming their products primarily at dudes, but that ain’t the case here. <strong>These guys sell a range of adult products for everyone, with a titular product made special for ladies</strong>. The site gets a couple hundred thousand visitors a month, which suggests a whole lot of sexy, intimate moments around the world. You up for creating your own?</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Let’s Talk About That Rose Toy, Officially</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Typically, if I’m reviewing some newfangled sex toy, it’s an expensive dick stroker with some variation on the old buzz, jerk, spin and suck technology. If you want to know the truth, I spent my first 30 seconds or so looking at the RoseToy-Official front page and wondering, “How am I supposed to fit my dick in that?” It’s just an expectation set by the market, really.</p><p></p><p>Looking very much like a plastic rose toy you might find at a kid’s princess-themed birthday party, <strong>the Rose Toy is an affordable and unique clit stimulator</strong>. It doesn’t look at all like similar products I’ve seen on the market, making for easy covert placement in your bedside table drawer or purse. The base model is just $37 as I type this up, too, which is less than you’d pay for a high-end dildo. It is worth mentioning there’s a $74.99 price tag crossed out, and I’m not sure if and when they’ll be asking that “regular” price.</p><p></p><p>I know that most of my visitors around here are dudes, but you should consider buying one of these things for your wife or just to keep on hand. I’ve said it a million times, but sex toys for women are nothing for a dude to be afraid of. To the contrary, they can spice up your sex lives in a big way. If there’s any doubt at all, check out my work at MissAVDHCasting when I let my guests dig into my toybox!</p><p></p><p>The RoseToy-Official demo videos are worth a look. It’s got 7 suction patterns, and they show off the power by dipping it in water and letting the droplets fly. “The rotating airflow generated by the internal vibration sucks and teases the clitoris. The rose toy mimics perfect oral sex,” reads the description. It’s waterproof, medical-grade silicone and USB-rechargable, just like you want out of a modern sex toy.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>And a Whole Lot More for the Ladies</h3><p></p><p></p><p>I like how so many of RoseToy-Official’s products have a rose built into the design. That’s some solid branding, my dudes, like printing a picture of your big cartoon head on all the merch you’re putting out. (By the way, have you checked out MissAVDHShop lately?) Their cock-ring clit stimulators, magic wands and other devices often have a stylized floral touch to them. It’s very feminine, if you ask me, so they’re perfect for stimulating your naughty bits.</p><p></p><p>It probably won’t come as a huge surprise given the general theme of Rose Toy Official, but <strong>they’ve got a truly extensive range of products for women</strong>. The full lineup includes just over 1600 gizmos, doodads and nicknacks designed for getting those juices flowing. The selection is so wide that you’ll probably want to use those dropdown menus to dial in exactly what you’re looking for.</p><p></p><p>So, what’ll it be? They’ve got around 50 realistic dildos, over 130 that vibrate, and a dozen made of glass if you’re feeling fancy. There are sections full of strap-ons and double-ended dildos, 30 made for your asshole, and 16 fantasy dildos styled after tentacles, vegetables and alien appendages.</p><p></p><p>RoseToy-Official.com even has a couple dozen automatic thrusting sex machines. If you’ve seen these bad boys on the webcam sites and BDSM tubes and wondered where they came from, well, look no further. The nicer units might cost you a few hundred bucks, a pretty penny, but they’ve got auto-humpers starting at under a hundo if you’re hard up for a robotic pounding.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>And Let’s Not Neglect the Horny Dudes</h3><p></p><p></p><p>As with the female masturbators, prices are fucking solid, with automated dick-strokers starting at under a hundred bucks. I really wonder if the prices will go up as RoseToy-Official.com grows in popularity. Similar products sold by bigger names like Tenga could cost twice as much, easily, making some of these price tags feel like a real steal. Those 3-in-1 Mouth Vagina Anus fap sleeves are looking mighty appealing at around $30 each.</p><p></p><p>There’s an aisle of Realistic Butts, but it’s clearly not one of the shop’s specialties. They’ve only got a few, and they’re tiny. If you’re in the market for a synthetic companion, full body or partial, I’d recommend a look at my list of Sex Doll Shops here at MissAVDH. Those can be a pretty big fucking investment, so you should really shop around at some of the bigger, better stores before pulling the trigger.</p><p></p><p>The lack of sex dolls is a minor complaint, and expected given Rose Toy Official’s primary focus on female masturbation devices. A lot of the site’s perks apply to everyone and everything they sell, though. For example, <strong>they offer free shipping on orders over $69</strong>. Nice! You typically get your new toys in just a few days.</p><p></p><p>There’s also some kind of bulk rewards program, though I couldn’t tell if it’s a regular feature or just a special they’re running. As I type this up, they’re offering bigger and bigger discounts depending on how much you spend. Drop $139 and you save $20; spend $199 and save $50.</p><p></p><p>Do I really have to go over the return policy? You know the deal: nobody’s taking back anything you already touched your genitals with. Consult the return policy if there are any questions, but really, you’re only eligible for something if there’s a fuckup along the way--unless the fuckup is your fault, in which case you get nothing.</p><p></p><p>The range of products and the affordable prices at RoseToy-Official.com make the shop an easy recommendation for anybody in the market for some new adult doodads, but I’d say those titular Rose Toys are still the star of the show around here. These guys make an awesome range of unique clit suckers that have been making a ton of buzz lately—literally. If you’re looking for a gift for your special lady or just want to get yourself off on your lunch break, well, these guys can definitely help you out.</p>"}},{"id":"e34edafea027","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"e34edafea027","title":"Intimaly","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"Intimaly.com has made some of the most realistic pocket pussy.

Sure, there’s a sense of intimacy baked into every cheapo pocket pussy and knockoff Fleshlight ever made, if only because you’re probably going to be using it in private and putting your dick in it. Even your hand can add a little intimacy when you’re fapping to your favorite starlets, but it still feels very private and personal. Wouldn’t you like to get more directly intimate with those girls on the screen?</p><p></p><p>The modern era of social media pornography finally lets fans interact with their favorite sex starlets through sites like Instagram and OnlyFans, and Intimaly.com offers yet another way to get just a little closer to your favorite internet models: <strong>they make remarkably realistic sex toys modeled after popular online creators</strong>. Pornstar replica cooters ain’t a new concept, but as we’ll see in a second here, they ain’t just slapping a name and a headshot on the box are tripling the price around here. Even if you don’t have a favorite influencer, these synthetic fuck holes might be worth a look.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>From the Screen to the Palm of Your Hand</h3><p></p><p></p><p>So let’s talk about those creators. <strong>They work with dozens of male, female and trans models from around the internet</strong>, with faces you’ll recognize from platforms like Instagram, OnlyFans, Snapchat and YouTube. If you’re feeling a little extra kinky, <strong>they’ve even got pocket pussies based on hentai VTubers</strong>. I really expected the Intimaly Girls aisle to have way more products than the other sections, just like you find on pretty much every other sex toy website. It looks like they’re making a real effort to cater to all demographics and sexual orientations, though, so you’ll find dozens of fuckable lumps of silicone in each category.</p><p></p><p>I do wish they included some social media links so we could see more of each model, because frankly, the whole website is a great way for these chicks to get new fans. I’m always looking for new masturbatory gadgets, and these all have fapworthy tie-ins across the internet. If someone catches your eye on Intimaly.com, Google their name and you’re in for a treat.</p><p></p><p>Some of the creators featured out front include German BDSM beauty Sophie Elodie, whose pocket pussy comes with piercings, and Blinkx, a Twitch streamer with a fantastic Fansly page. Spooky camgirl FatalGoth has her own Intimaly replia, as does the voluptuous Motley Monroe. There’s diversity among every section of the catalog, so you’ve also got your pick of chubby cuties (Pout Princess), ebony gamer girls (Uirigame), and big-dicked trans babes (Bambi Hart).</p><p></p><p></p><h3>So Real, You’ll Just Cum</h3><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Intimaly.com offers free shipping</strong>. That’s pretty standard so you probably expected it, but I’m mentioning it now to offset what I’m going to tell you next. My only immediate complaint about the website is that these toys are kind of pricey. You can buy a no-name pocket pussy at your stinky local porn store for considerably less, but it's going to seem like a toy compared to these, um, other toys.</p><p></p><p>Most of their products run between $150 and $300, but I think they’re worth it for a few reasons. For one thing, these replicas let you feel what your favorite model feels like inside as you’re gawking at their content. The models also get commissions, so <strong>you’ll be supporting your favorite creators directly</strong>. They don’t get anything if you’re just chafing yourself on an old sock while you’re surfing OnlyFans.</p><p></p><p>Intimaly’s also making some of the most lifelike toys on the market. This may come as a surprise to some of you, but I’m a bit of a connoisseur with a whole box full of toys, and the realism here absolutely puts the no-name products to shame. Zoom in tight enough on some of those pics and you’d think they were attached to a real human babe, not a fist-sized jiggly thing.</p><p></p><p>If your favorite OnlyFans chick hasn’t partnered with them yet, or you just ain’t that picky, they’ve got a mystery pocket pussy available for $99. As I’ve said, they’re not the cheapest male masturbators, but I think a hundo is a more than fair price for a fap sleeve of this quality. I’m not just saying that as a guy who got a boner looking at the website, but as a guy who stuck his boner inside one of those realistic fake hoohas.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Starryfawn and Her Amazing Fake Vagina</h3><p></p><p></p><p>You can look her up on Pornhub if you don’t want to pay for her no-PPV OnlyFans, or you can just see what her pussy looks like via the pics on Intimaly. Theirs is a replica, but it’s pretty fucking close to the real thing.</p><p></p><p>Direct-to-consumer drop shipping from China has grown popular in the last couple years, and now it sometimes feels like buying anything on the internet is a gamble. I just bought a Raoul Duke jacket for Halloween, and I’m probably not going to wear it because it doesn’t look anything like the pic. On the other hand, I think Starryfawn’s pocket pussy looks even better than the photo. The level of detail is incredible, from the subtle fleshy textures to the shading that I’m sure had to be airbrushed by hand.</p><p></p><p>The size and weight are perfect, and I really love the curvy little bits on the body of the thing. While it doesn’t feel exactly like any particular part of a woman’s body in your hand, there’s something about it that’s far more inviting and pleasant than a hard plastic shell, a non-descript jiggly cylinder or anything with a grippy, industrial texture. This baby feels great in your palm, and that ain’t the only place.</p><p></p><p>It doesn’t have the most elaborately textured inner channel I’ve ever experienced, but it’s definitely a couple steps up from the cheaper toys, and it feels fantastic. The little nubs on the lower side of the tube really do it for me. I haven’t tried the anal opening yet, but a quick finger test tells me it’s going to be an even tighter fit. I can’t wait. If you don’t already have a warmer for your sex toys, they’ve got one for $30 and the added realism is worth every penny.</p><p></p><p>Intimaly.com doesn’t make the cheapest pocket pussies out there, but they do make some of the best. Their products are ostensibly aimed at fans of the creators they’ve partnered with, and they’re a super easy recommendation if you’ve got an internet crush on any of them. That said, the high quality and absurd level of realism puts these masturbatory machines on a top shelf, where I think they’ll appeal to any pervert looking for a serious upgrade from the junk they sell on Amazon. They’re working with new creators and putting out new products all the time, so take a look if you’re in the market or just curious.</p>"}},{"id":"9e532cf20d50","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"9e532cf20d50","title":"The Kink Store","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"KinkStore.com is a super perverted adult toy store curated by the people behind Kink.com, offering hundreds of BDSM toys and fetish products for over $69 for free shipping","canonical":"https://theporndude.com/zh/18939/thekinkstore","affiliate_url":"https://kinkstore.com/?_ef_transaction_id=&oid=2&affid=6341587","rating":4,"siteOrder":14,"price":"free","tags":[],"features":[],"categories":[{"id":"best-adult-online-shops","collection":"categories_en"}],"screenshot_url":"https://cdn.staticstack.net/assets/img/r-thumbs/f43fd37-thekinkstore_small.png","image_alt":"The Kink Store, Sex Toy Store","scraped_at":"2025-10-28T18:03:00.889Z","iconSpritesheet":"default","logoIconClass":"icon2016","pros":["sex toy shop with an emphasis on the kinky stuff","kink-branded adult toys","really fucking decent prices","a wide, kinky selection of toys","free shipping on orders over $69 – nice!","customer reviews"],"cons":["not many third-party products"],"detailedDescription":"<p>Now, what in the world could they possibly sell in the Kink Store? It could be a tongue-in-cheek name for a rope shop or a massage parlor, and yeah, you’ll actually find some products among the catalog that could be used for similar purposes. Their ropes ain’t exactly intended for keeping your boat from floating away, but they will ensure your squirming gimp or sex slave can’t get off the floor while you’re working them over with a powerful electronic massage implement. (That’s only kind of a joke, because you can certainly take it literally. Just make sure you have consent and a safe word you can understand through a ball gag.)</p><p></p><p>KinkStore.com would be a great name for this shop just based on the kind of products they carry, but it’s actually better than that: <strong>this is a fetish-oriented sex toy shop curated by the folks who run Kink.com</strong>. They’ve been one of the biggest names in BDSM and other extra-kinky masturbatory fare for a couple decades now, so I felt a familiar tingle in my loins as soon as I saw their logo. The site gets an easy hundred thousand visitors a month, and I was curious to see how the selection differed from the next adult toy store on the internet. Crawl along with me as I take a deeper look.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>What if Kink.com Sold Sex Toys?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Being a longstanding, well-recognized company in such a deep niche, I honestly expected much higher prices at Kink Store than what I found inside. Instead of gouging their customers on products they’d be hard pressed to find on Amazon or the aforementioned local glory-hole stop, <strong>KinkStore prices are really fucking reasonable</strong>. Premium jute Shibari rope starts at just a few bucks per length, powerful clit vibrators can be had for about sixteen bucks, and they’ve got intimidating metal butt plugs for under a tenner.</p><p></p><p>I didn’t see a lot of really big-name adult toy brands like Tenga or Fleshlight, though I found a handful of products you might find on the shelf elsewhere. This seemed especially true in some of the electronics aisles, where I found Zero Tolerance beaded vibrating anal plugs and Renegade Orbit prostate massagers. Maybe they used to stock more third-party stroking gizmos and bondage apparatuses, but <strong>it looks like most of the current catalog consists of Kink-branded toys</strong>.</p><p></p><p>In theory, that means most of what you’ll find here literally can’t be found anywhere else. I dug into the KinkStore.com documentation a bit, hoping to learn a little more about how products are selected, developed and manufactured for the shop. I couldn’t find anything. For all I know, they’re just slapping that devil-tailed letter K on their favorite toys. That said, I trust these guys a lot more than I would a newer, unproven ecommerce shop. Their other endeavors have always been high quality, so why wouldn’t their toys?</p><p></p><p>And you know who I trust even more than a faceless company in a black mask with no eye holes? The customers. <strong>KinkStore.com lets users leave reviews of their purchases</strong>, and I always recommend taking a peek at what other perverts are saying. Hell, that’s why you’re here at MissAVDH, right? Overall, it looks like their selection is well reviewed by the folks actually paying for it. I was also happy to see some of the negative reviews addressed directly, with support reaching out to help make things right.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Not Your Typical Dildo Aisle</h3><p></p><p></p><p>As I clicked my way to the Dildo Play section, I was really expecting to write something like, “The dildo selection is the most typical page of their catalog, full of the familiar fake dicks available anywhere else.” That ain’t at all what I found, though. They’ve got the usual strap-ons and realistic suction cup dongs, but they’ve also got giant demon dicks, metal ass hooks, silicone tentacles, and a big, hard hog at the end of an expandable four-foot rod.</p><p></p><p>I’d say the most “traditional” shelf in the Kink Store is their half-dozen Masturbators and Strokers. We’ve all seen the same general designs before, but twenty bucks for an off-brand Fleshlight is a pretty solid value. Even if you’re not into fetish play, Kink’s Blue Wave Electric Stroker is worth a look. I’m not sure I’ve seen an electronic cock massager for $24 before, and definitely not one with a major adult brand on the label.</p><p></p><p><strong>The selection ain’t just kinky, but expansive in scope</strong>. Before the internet and before KinkStore.com, people into kinky play often had to settle for whatever was available, or even homebrew their own fuck machines, nipple twisters and ball-zappers. Every aisle here is well stocked, including a couple dozen toys for Pet Play, twice that for Sensory Play enthusiasts, and around a hundred filed under BDSM.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Discount Floggers and Premium Shockers</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Whatever you buy, <strong>shipping is free on orders over $69</strong>. Nice! I think it should go without saying, but like any decent adult shop out there, they ship your goods in plain, discreet packaging. I’m not going to name any names, but a company recently sent me a promo item in a box that made it clear what kind of tomfoolery I was up to. It wasn’t a big deal for me as a world renown professional masturbator, but don’t worry, KinkStore ain’t going to out you to your family, mailman and neighbors as an anal electrostimulation fan.</p><p></p><p>On that note, they’ve got a killer range of toys designed for zapping, shocking and stimulating your lover’s private parts—or your own. One of the newest featured Kink Store products is their very own E-Stim Power box. It’s a beautifully streamlined gadget, designed for easy play without any tech knowledge. This thing literally just came out, and they’ve got some exciting firmware updates planned, like “modes driven by a variety of factors such as audio, GPS, phone orientation and distance from the unit.” My mind is already going wild with the possibilities!</p><p></p><p>KinkStore.com is perhaps the easiest recommendation I can give for anybody in the market for fetish or BDSM-oriented sex toys. Kink is one of the most respected, trusted names in the kinkier side of adult entertainment, and they’ve filled their store with exactly the kinds of toys you expect to see in their movies. The range and variety are incredible, catering to all kinds of deep-niche sexual interests that ain’t even mentioned on the big-name porn sites. With free shipping and literally some of the best prices I’ve seen at any sex toy shop, you’d have to be a masochistic coprophile to overpay for the crap they sell elsewhere.</p>"}},{"id":"7a62999e8350","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"7a62999e8350","title":"CupsLand","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"CupsLand.com is a maker of male masturbation equipment dedicated to satisfying the fantasies that other companies ignore are cheaper than big-name toys","canonical":"https://theporndude.com/zh/17418/cupsland","affiliate_url":"https://cupsland.com/?ref=MissAVDH","rating":4,"siteOrder":15,"price":"free","tags":[],"features":[],"categories":[{"id":"best-adult-online-shops","collection":"categories_en"}],"screenshot_url":"https://cdn.staticstack.net/assets/img/r-thumbs/82407_cupsland_small.jpg","image_alt":"CupsLand, Sex Toy Store","scraped_at":"2025-10-28T18:03:08.298Z","iconSpritesheet":"custom-favicon-spritesheet.png","iconPosition":"-352px -816px","iconClassName":"ctm-icon17418","logoIconClass":"icon17418","pros":["maker of male self-pleasure devices","history of well-received products","twirl 1.0, an adjustable male masturbation toy","cheaper than a fleshlight","free shipping"],"cons":["only one product currently listed on website"],"detailedDescription":"<p>I never would have guessed Cupsland made things you can stick your dick inside of if I’d just heard the name. A lot of brands roll with something at least a little bit suggestive, and to be honest, I’m not sure exactly what Cupsland was aiming for with the name. It sounds like they make dishes, not male masturbators, but hey, what’s in a name? If you boil this whole industry down to just the very basics, the only thing that really matters is how well any adult website helps get you off, whether we’re talking hookup platforms, free porn tubes, or sex toy shops.</p><p></p><p>Cupsland.com describes itself as a brand that “promotes a lifestyle that encourages men to explore their desires, offering realistic experiences and high-quality products for ultimate self-pleasure.” That’s a real fancy way of saying they make sex toys for dudes, though I appreciate the intellectualizing. It sure sounds sophisticated, don’t it? The company has been around in some form or another for around 15 years now, but have been getting some recent press thanks to the release of their new Twirl 1.0 adjustable masturbator. They even sent me one to play with, so it seemed like a good time to learn more about these perverts and what they have to offer.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Where’d These Guys Even Come From?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Turns out, the company was launched back in 2009, but they weren’t making their own toys just yet. They started as another internet sex shop, shipping off a catalog of over a thousand naughty items to horny dudes around the world. They decided to start developing their own products in 2022, when the company’s founder “saw the need for products that focus on deeper male fantasies”. It sounds a little bit like marketing fluff, because fap sleeves are more of a supplement to your fantasies, not the fantasies themselves; I didn’t pop any wood just looking at pics of the Twirl.</p><p></p><p>According to Cupsland.com, the company was officially born in 2024. It looks like all those years they spent as retailers helped them learn a thing or two and make some connections, because they’ve got pretty impressive reach for such a new company. You can find their products on many of the sites on my list of Online Sex Toy Shops here at MissAVDH, though the Twirl 1.0 is still a Cupsland.com exclusive.</p><p></p><p>You’ll see images of that new toy plastered all over the website, often held by a goateed dude in a wife beater. I assumed he was just some Zoolander they hired for a photoshoot, but nah, turns out that’s the guy who started the company, Caleb Harrison. You can tell the guy is serious about self-love, because he’s put pictures of himself all over the website. Hey, I get it. I’ve got my own handsome mug stamped all over my site for the same reason!</p><p></p><p>You ever find a Wikipedia entry about a small-time celebrity who clearly did the writeup themself? That’s how the About Us page reads, and I’ve got to give it to my dude Caleb for his spirit of entrepreneurship. There’s a lot of hype here, talking about his innovation, passion and adventurous drive. It’s a believable if inflated backstory, but in the end, it doesn’t matter much. We’re just here to jack off, Caleb.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>So Let’s Talk About That Twirl</h3><p></p><p></p><p>As a man of myriad, oft-deep sexual fantasies and masturbatory needs, I was curious how their products would help me explore them better than the average truck-stop pocket pussy. I made my way to the Products section of Cupsland.com to find out, expecting to find a range of their products like I’d found on other sites. I’m not sure why, but the Twirl 1.0 is currently the only thing available directly from the Cupsland website.</p><p></p><p>The Twirl is an enclosed masturbator, the fleshy and textured pink sleeve wrapped in a sculpted plastic shell. Why is it called the Twirl? Because you twirl the end to adjust the intensity, with four levels of tightness to personalize your masturbatory experience.</p><p></p><p>If that sounds like a Fleshlight, well, it’s because it’s basically a Fleshlight with a different twisty mechanism for regulating the pressure. It is, however, <strong>cheaper than your average Fleshlight</strong>. The Twirl 1.0 currently goes for about $70, which is the same price you’d pay for only the most basic, bare-bones version of the big-name competitor. Once you roll in the Cupsland.com coupon included on the website, you’re even beating that price. They throw in free shipping, too, making it way cheaper than your last Tinder date. You’ll actually get your rocks off this time, too.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Twirling Away My Afternoon</h3><p></p><p></p><p>I couldn’t find it listed whether the NaturSKIN inner sleeve is made of silicone or TPE, but it felt fucking great. Currently, the only insert available is the vagina-themed one it comes with, though I have to assume more are on the way. It’d be such a waste of a good modular design if they didn’t release more; the thing pops in and out of the case with ease. More sleeves would give users more reasons to come back and spend more money. More!</p><p></p><p>Twisting the top offers four noticeably different intensities, tightening up with every notch. I do wonder if they settled on four positions for aesthetic purposes, because the edges of the case line up with each click. I’m no sex toy engineer, as my Emergency Room bill can attest, but I’d prefer a smoother rotation with more positions. The innards are plastic grinding on plastic, moving so stiffly that I took mine apart and greased it up. If you’ve got lube on your hands, good luck adjusting that sucker.</p><p></p><p>Based on the fact that they’ve named it the Twirl 1.0, I’m guessing they’re already planning out their improvements. The thing’s a big upgrade from your hand in its current state, and some little tweaks could potentially elevate the company to major player status in the sex toy game.</p><p></p><p>Cupsland designs their products with discretion in mind, but how discreet are they? To me, the Twirl and their other products sure as hell look like sex toys, but I say that as a man with a walk-in closet full of fap sleeves, onaholes, pocket pussies, fake butts and fuck robots. It’s definitely less recognizable than a “flashlight” with a cap on the end, but that’s only because Cupsland doesn’t have the requisite level of brand recognition. Yet.</p><p></p><p>I’m really curious to see what Cupsland.com comes up with next. The folks behind the scenes have been in the adult toy industry for over a decade, and they’ve had a great first year run as a toy maker themselves. You’ve got a lot of options out there when it comes to contraptions you can play with while perusing the other delights I gather here at MissAVDH, and it takes a lot to get noticed in this crowded field. Cupsland already has an edge, so let’s see if they can keep it.</p>"}},{"id":"2700a5e42f43","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"2700a5e42f43","title":"AdultRepDao","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"AdultRepDao.com is one of the world's leading suppliers of high-end sex machines to let remote control mechanisms fuck you for free delivery","canonical":"https://theporndude.com/zh/15970/adultrepdao","affiliate_url":"https://adultrepdao.com/?referral=geoffrey","rating":4,"siteOrder":16,"price":"free","tags":["免费"],"features":[],"categories":[{"id":"best-adult-online-shops","collection":"categories_en"}],"screenshot_url":"https://cdn.staticstack.net/assets/img/r-thumbs/9e76f06-adultrepdao_small.png","image_alt":"AdultRepDao, Sex Toy Store","scraped_at":"2025-10-28T18:03:14.403Z","iconSpritesheet":"custom-favicon-spritesheet.png","iconPosition":"-80px -784px","iconClassName":"ctm-icon15970","logoIconClass":"icon15970","pros":["adult toy shop specializing in sex machines","small selection of high-end love dolls","incredible selection of fuck machines","free worldwide shipping on orders $150+","discount coupon","birthday discount and free toys for spreading the word","fucksaw adapters (dildos for your power tools)","a wide range of attachments"],"cons":["not the cheapest sex toys in the world"],"detailedDescription":"<p>Adult Rep Dao ain’t the typical kind of site I review around here at MissAVDH. Sure, it’s got “Adult” in the title, so you know it’s aimed at the same horny demographics I usually encounter. This ain’t another free tube or paysite, though. It’s a sex toy store, but it ain’t even the usual selection of common dick-strokers, love dolls and vibrators you find lining the shelves on other sites. Still, you may have seen some of their big sellers, especially if you like seeing women getting banged by cold, hard, mechanical contraptions.</p><p></p><p>Do you see what I’m getting at? <strong>AdultRepDao.com is a high-end sex toy shop specializing in fuck machines</strong>. The company has been making the gizmos since 2013 and making a name for themselves for just as long. These days, their website is getting close to 20,000 visitors a month, which ain’t chump change. A site like this is going to get a lot of curious window shoppers, but they wouldn’t have stuck around this long if they weren’t moving a shitload of units. Let’s see what all they’ve got to offer, shall we?</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Ever Wanted to Get Fucked by a Robot?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Many of the products sliding by at the top of the screen will seem familiar, too. They’ve got the fake dicks attached to thrusting black boxes that you imagined as soon as I said Sex Machines, and a few realistic love dolls. They’ve got 16 premium love dolls in the catalog, starting at just over $700. The selection ain’t bad, but honestly, I’d recommend a dedicated sex doll shop if you’re in the market, and I’ve got a big list of them here at MissAVDH.</p><p></p><p>What really caught my eye at AdultRepDao, though, were the products I haven’t seen before. I say this as a certified pervert, a traveler of the internet’s sleaziest corners, and the world’s most respected connoisseur of adult content: these guys sell some truly freaky, beautiful, and downright intimidating fuck machines. I’ve reviewed other sites with similar machinery, at least in function, but the engineers at AdultRepDao are some seriously groundbreaking perverts.</p><p></p><p>Case in point: one of the featured products right now is a little something called the Roussan Wearable Thrusting Sex Machine with Cordless Remote Control. The bulk of the contraption is a big black box that straps to your ass with a band around your waist, from which protrudes a dildo on a lever attached to a motor in the box. You can guess what the remote control does. It can also strap to a chair for a different angle of approach.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Free Shipping, Free Toys and Other Perks</h3><p></p><p></p><p>As I type up this review, they’re also offering a nice discount coupon for any order over $100. Again, that’s going to be most orders. This is one of those baked-in discounts that almost everyone should get, and the one small catch is that you’ve got to remember the coupon code. They’ve got a quick, easy link in the AdultRepDao.com header, so don’t forget to see what you’re eligible for. Right now, you get $20 off orders of at least $100, and up to a hundo off bigger purchases.</p><p></p><p>Oh, and is your birthday coming up? AdultRepDao will give you 5% off orders placed within 7 days of your special day. I don’t usually get excited over 5%, but I’m not usually reviewing sites full of such pricey machinery. If you’re looking to maximize the bang for your buck, time your orders appropriately.</p><p></p><p>Not to beat you over the head with the perks, but <strong>you can also score free sex toys just by spreading the word about your Adult Rep Dao experience</strong>. You don’t have to show your face, and they accept posts on damn near any social media site. They’re pretty vague about what kind of freebie they’ll hook you up with, but hey, free is free. “If you have purchased a sex machine from us and want one free toy on the house, all you need to do is read our rules here.”</p><p></p><p>Adult Rep Dao’s policy on returns and refunds is a little more generous than most sex toy shops, since you’ve got 30 days to decide whether or not you’re satisfied or if you want your money back. That said, they’ve got the same basic rules as anywhere else. You can’t send back anything that’s been inside of you, or that you’ve put your dick inside of. This ain’t Taco Bell, my dudes. Have a little fucking class.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Let’s Talk About Those Fucksaw Adapters</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Turns out, those Fucksaw Adapters are basically dildos that attach to literal power tools. The reasons for the disclaimer are immediately apparent from the early moments of the demonstration video, which also feature instructions like “Use speed controller to make sure it won’t stroke too fast!” I have to wonder if the silicone torso getting boned into jiggling oblivion as a demonstration is stronger or weaker than real, human flesh. Well, there’s one surefire way to find out for sure, right? (Just kidding. I think their disclaimer is good and valid.)</p><p></p><p>Whether you opt for a Fucksaw Adapter or one of the more “traditional” sex machines, <strong>AdultRepDao.com offers a nice, wide array of attachments to get mechanically fucked by</strong>. Any kind of specialty product can get expensive in a hurry, which is one of the reasons I was pleasantly surprised to see realistic fake dingdong attachments starting at just under thirty bones. At the other end of the spectrum, their 12.6” Huge Super Soft Realistic Vein Texture Silicone Dildo for Lustti Sex Machines will set you back a couple hundo.</p><p></p><p>Honestly, though, I’m not sure Adult Rep Dao is really the shop for the most budget-oriented consumers. They make similar points out on the front page, where they explain that you often end up paying double for the cheaper units out there because they end up breaking. The cheapest sex machines on AdultRepDao are a little over $300, but you get what you pay for. Anyway, who wants a robot’s fake dick breaking off inside of them?</p><p></p><p>Mechanical fuck machines are still a deep enough niche that you don’t have many options if you’re in the market for one. AdultRepDao.com is one of the better choices out there, with their range of oft unique and deeply freaky sex machines. They’re not the cheapest sex toy store in the world, but they ain’t aiming their products at the cheapskates and the bums of the world. I’d put this one at the top of your list if you’re a content creator or just a true enthusiast looking for a robotic lover who will deliver consistently hard fucks, and who ain’t shy about paying for a good one.</p>"}},{"id":"3426d2ee5d4b","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"3426d2ee5d4b","title":"SVL Toys","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"SVLToys.com is a newly opened sex toy store Its sex toy library guarantees both men, girls and couples a fascinating orgasm, but it also needs a blog","canonical":"https://theporndude.com/zh/18220/svltoys","affiliate_url":"https://svltoys.com/?ref=MissAVDH","rating":4,"siteOrder":17,"price":"free","tags":[],"features":[],"categories":[{"id":"best-adult-online-shops","collection":"categories_en"}],"screenshot_url":"https://cdn.staticstack.net/assets/img/r-thumbs/c4682f2-svltoys_small.png","image_alt":"SVL Toys, Sex Toys Store","scraped_at":"2025-10-28T18:03:20.305Z","iconSpritesheet":"custom-favicon-spritesheet.png","iconPosition":"-240px -848px","iconClassName":"ctm-icon18220","logoIconClass":"icon18220","pros":["an impressive set up from a new site, and it feels like it’s been around for years","there’s already a hefty array of helpful views numbering in their thousands on the site","the moving gifs accompanying the sex toys are a solid way to navigate the site quickly"],"cons":["the only thing missing from the store is a dedicated sex toy blog"],"detailedDescription":"<p>Have you ever watched the Naked Gun series? If not, then I implore you to do whatever it takes to sit through them all (after you’ve finished reading this latest wild review). You see, there’s a scene in The Naked Gun 2½: The Smell of Fear that sees the movie’s main character, Frank Drebin, raid a seedy sex shop on the wrong side of town, and it’s one of my all-time favorites.</p><p></p><p>‘’Oh, hey, Frank! We finally got that Model D83 Swedish sure-grip suck machine that you ordered!’’ says the naive sales assistant appearing from the sex shop’s backroom, shattering Frank’s noble crime fighter aesthetic. What’s even funnier, though, is how a toy like that sounded out of this world back in the 1990s. Nowadays? It sounds like something for sex toy newbies!</p><p></p><p>I honestly don’t understand why anybody would watch porn armed with nothing but their hand these days. I understand people like to keep it old school, but come on! Are you really gonna sit there and try telling me that ‘’Madame Palm and her five sisters’’ can compete with the lifelike cunt of a pornstar replicated into a high-tech Fleshlight? Hell no!</p><p></p><p>Hell, these days, you don’t even have to face the awkwardness of walking into your local sex shop and having a cute sales assistant approach you and ask, ‘’Do you need any assistance with finding your way through those BBC dildos, sir?’’ After all, it’s way easier to buy them online!</p><p></p><p>Well, it’s easier if you choose the right site! Choosing the wrong one and getting your hands on dodgy sex toys can be a disaster. At best, you can end up with a rash from some shitty sex toy materials. At worst? Shit, maybe that robot sex doll you bought will become self-aware and trigger a Terminator-style scenario in your bedroom. That’s why I’ve decided to review them all and show you what’s what, which brings me to the topic of today’s review: Svltoys.com!</p><p></p><p></p><h3>What is Svltoys.com?</h3><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>What Kind of Sex Toy Arsenal Does Svltoys.com Have?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>● This Two-Pronged Toy Might Ruin Your Bedsheets - Look, there are plenty of women out there who can no doubt relate to feeling the sensation of a cock plowing their pussy and thinking, ‘’fuck, I wish I had a tongue lapping at my clit at the same time!’’ Well, unless you’re down to find a willing cuck who is happy to put his face on the frontline of a fuck fest and lick you to orgasm while a pair of balls are slapping his face, this toy will have to do! It’s a wild little invention that combines a thrusting dildo with a rose sex toy. While the former pounds your cunt and triggers your G-spot, the latter sucks and laps at your clit until you experience the kind of orgasms that are usually only reserved for Hotwives with a willing sub!</p><p>● The Ideal Stroker For Porn Fanatics - Fellas, don’t you hate it when you’re mid-stroke in a particularly intense wank, and you have to switch the porn on your screen, smearing pre-cum and lube all over it by accident? Well, the StrokerXP has your horny ass covered. This is a wild toy that looks like it fell from a damn spaceship and combines a high-tech pocket pussy device with a screen holder for you to slot a smartphone in and start watching porn. Using the handles and button system on the side, you can control everything from the porn on the screen to the thrusts of the lifelike cunt massaging your dick. The future is now, motherfucker!</p><p>● The Pleasure Fusion Pro is Ideal For Couples Who Want Porn-Grade Sessions - ‘’I don’t need sex toys, MissAVDH! I’ve got a hot bitch at home whom I can fuck whenever I want!’’ I hear you say. Well, wait until you see the next toy, and let’s see if you say the same! The Pleasure Fusion Pro is a high-tech cock piece that wraps around your shaft, keeps your meat as hard as Soviet steel, and delays ejaculation so you can deliver the kind of porn-tier performance in the bedroom and have your bitch cumming harder than she ever has in her life. It’s the kind of accessory every dude should have in his arsenal. After all, it’s better to have it and not need it than to need it and not have it, right?</p><p></p><p></p><h3>The Design of the Sex Store</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Underlining the top of the header is a sleek main menu with links pointing to the site’s sex toy categories, such as women, guys, couples, vibrators, anal toys, etc. This is followed by a massive banner section that has a cool graphic of different sex toys, an intro to the site and its mission, and a CTA Button for you to sink deeper into its portfolio of categories.</p><p></p><p>Further down is an array of eight toys currently on sale, each with moving GIFs showcasing the toy and its functions, along with a snapshot of the title, price, and reviews it has. The same format is repeated for the following sections covering the best-selling toys amongst men and women on the site.</p><p></p><p>Towards the bottom of Svltoys.com’s homepage, you’ll see a selection of popular site categories organized with easy-on-the-eye featured images. There’s also a series of selling points the site has to offer, along with a snapshot into some of the latest sex toy reviews verified customers have left on Svltoys.com.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>What I Like Most About It</h3><p></p><p></p><p>The site’s review section is also pretty damn cool. So far, Svltoys.com has amassed more than 3,000 customer reviews, and they can be a great way to get insight into the site and determine whether it’s trustworthy or not. More importantly, they sometimes come packed with solid tips about the toys in question, how best to use them, and who they’re best suited for.</p><p></p><p>Oh, and another epic element on Svltoys.com is the moving GIFs the site has deployed for the toys’ featured images. These allow you to not only see what the toy looks like at a glance, but also showcase its functions and movements so you can get an idea of the kind of pleasure zones it’ll be targeting.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>What I Don’t Like</h3><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Suggestions I Have For Svltoys.com</h3><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p></p>"}},{"id":"99df49d67653","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"99df49d67653","title":"Nothosaur","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"Nothosaur.com is one of the leading manufacturers of high-quality fantasy sex toys Products include realistic horse dildo monster dildo alien masturbation device and more","canonical":"https://theporndude.com/zh/17387/nothosaur","affiliate_url":"https://nothosaur.com/?ref=dbjvdxwd","rating":4,"siteOrder":18,"price":"free","tags":[],"features":[],"categories":[{"id":"best-adult-online-shops","collection":"categories_en"}],"screenshot_url":"https://cdn.staticstack.net/assets/img/r-thumbs/0448586-nothosaur_small.png","image_alt":"Nothosaur, sex toy store","scraped_at":"2025-10-28T18:03:31.359Z","iconSpritesheet":"custom-favicon-spritesheet.png","iconPosition":"-320px -816px","iconClassName":"ctm-icon17387","logoIconClass":"icon17387","pros":["fantasy sex toys","award-winning quality","a wide selection of unique products","most items are customizable","fast shipping"],"cons":["smaller selection of items aimed at straight dudes"],"detailedDescription":"<p>Nothosaur is a name that might not ring a bell for the average pervert, but if you’re among a certain demographic, you’re probably familiar with what they sell. Their fantastical toys are the kind of things people share photos of just for shits and giggles, though the novelty factor alone can’t account for the company’s longevity or popularity. No, you don’t stick around in this business unless your products are turning your customers on, getting them off, and helping them realize their fantasies.</p><p></p><p>Certain wet dreams take a special touch to realize, and that’s where Nothosaur.com comes into play. Since 2010, <strong>they’ve been selling realistic fantasy sex toys based on aliens, animals and assorted beasts</strong>. They’re a go-to shop for anybody in the market for a cumming horse dildo, a silicone tentacle or an ovipositor to pump you full of eggs, and not just because the nearest highway sex shop only carries fake human dongs. Read on and I’ll tell you all about their collection of unique products, including the freaky-ass custom fap sleeve they sent me.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>That Really Looks Like a Horse’s Dick</h3><p></p><p></p><p>There’s a similar epiphany to be had upon discovering Nothosaur.com for the first time. “Holy shit, somebody actually made that blue wolf pecker I’ve been dreaming about all these years!” As I type this up, the front page greets visitors with a spread of featured products that include a double-pronged dildo/buttplug belonging to a gentle forest giant, a Lovecraftian phallus wrapped in vines and tentacles, a dwarf dingdong that looks like it belongs to Swamp Thing, and a big ol’ number meant to simulate the mighty shaft of none other than Anubis himself.</p><p></p><p>There’s also a highly realistic horse cock called Hunter Jack among the featured spread. Companies making deep-niche products often do a half-ass job because they know their consumers have little choice, but holy fucking shit, this thing looks like a legit equine erection, veins and shading and all. The only unrealistic element is the bullet belt wrapped just above the base. If Mr. Hands had known about Nothosaur, he might still be alive, not continuing to spread trauma around the internet.</p><p></p><p><strong>That high level of quality has won Nothosaur awards</strong>. They took home the Best Sci Fi Toy at the 2022 Bazowie Awards for their Necron series, which is featured on the front page. These dildos are designed to look like they come from cybernetic centaurs, and I could tell even before I read the blurb that they were inspired by the work of H.R. Giger. There’s an attention to detail that you don’t get with the average simulated human boner. You can tell the company ain’t a fetishistic cash grab, but a true labor of love by folks who love what they do, and probably use what they’re making.</p><p></p><p>That love is apparent on pretty much every page of the website. I know you might miss it because you’re so busy looking for the perfect knot dildo for the dog fucker in your life, but they’ve actually spent a lot of time crafting the artwork and lore behind every piece in their catalog. The description for the Graemen cumming wolf-dude cock contains a 500-word blurb with a whole backstory and everything. “It likes to tease the unlucky guy he has just rescued with his proud weapon.” Kinky!</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Let’s Look at Some More of These Crazy Dildos</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Because what a collection it is. The catalog is heavily stacked with dildos of all shapes, sizes and colors, and the visuals ain’t the only thing that sets them apart from your average purchase from the Déjà Vu Love Boutique. They’ve got a baker’s dozen pretend schlongs fitted with pumps, so they can cum and squirt. They even sell a really creamy looking Cum Lubricant, so you can max out the realism.</p><p></p><p>Nothosaur’s aisle of Zodiac dildos is worth a look, if only to see how they’ve made your star sign into something you can shove up your butt. They’ve made a scorpion look pretty cock-like, and the Capricorn toy is a surrealist work of art. Leos get a giant-tongued lion, equipped for some big cat cunnilingus.</p><p></p><p>But what if you don’t want to get licked by the king of the jungle or knocked up by the fire-breathing guard of the deepest dungeon? What if your fantasy is being impregnated by an alien who lays an egg in the orifice of your choice? In that case, check out Nothosaur.com’s selection of ovipositor dildos. You can buy premade “Oggs” to get laid inside of you, or you can buy a mold and make your own.</p><p></p><p>There are some limitations based on which items you spring for, but <strong>most Nothosaur sex toys are customizable</strong>. You can choose just the right size to fill you up, pick out your favorite colors, and even select the perfect firmness. It’s like the story about Goldilocks, only in this version, you get to fuck the bears.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Anything for Straight Furry Dudes?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>There ain’t a ton of products for the average straight dude, but there are a few. The tentacle-shaped urethra sounds might be up your alley if you’re kinky, and they’ve also got goblin ball-sack cock rings and a handful of penis extenders that look like something out of your weirdest sex dream. Imagine if your dick turned into a fish with abs and then you fucked your wife, or just buy the thing and try it for yourself.</p><p></p><p>There’s also the item they sent me. Virgo’s Throne is a double-ended masturbation sleeve, but it doesn’t look like a human mouth, pussy or butthole, nor does it resemble a flashlight or any other inconspicuous item. No, it’s another sex toy that looks like it could have been sculpted by H.R. Giger himself. In a different color, it might look like it had angel wings wrapped around it, but mine looks more like a bug with its legs folded in. I’m reminded of something between the xenomorph eggs of Alien and the face-huggers they hatch into.</p><p></p><p>Despite the somewhat terrifying appearance, I really enjoyed sticking my dick inside of it. The attention to detail extends into the interior, where the channel is textured with little nubs that feel like… fucking an alien bug? Only this is an incredible wet dream, not a blood-curdling nightmare. That ain’t sweat all over the sheets.</p><p></p><p>Virgo’s Throne only comes in one softness, which turned out to be perfect for me, but I did ask Nothosaur for custom colors: pink on the inside, blue on the outside. Pink just looks good inside of a fuck toy, and I love the way the inner color blends with the outer shade, highlighting the otherworldly molding of the thing. Even with the customization, <strong>shipping was fast</strong>; I had my personalized fantasy fap sleeve in just a few days.</p><p></p><p>Honestly, Nothosaur.com is the kind of site I could recommend to anybody just looking to kill a few minutes, but it’s an even easier recommendation to anybody in the market for a fantasy sex toy. They’ve got an impressive catalog of highly detailed, highly customizable dildos and other fuckable trinkets that look like they came straight out of a hentai episode or your favorite furry comic. If you’ve ever wondered what it would be like to get it on with a unicorn, a tentacle monster, or a whole-ass horse, well, wonder no more. Nothosaur will help you live those fantasies.</p>"}},{"id":"fd4b22736865","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"fd4b22736865","title":"Uncover Creations","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"UncoverCreations.com Make high-quality custom fantasy sex toys hand-poured molds immediately after you place your order, dragon fucking dick tentacle grinder, etc.","canonical":"https://theporndude.com/zh/18224/uncovercreations","affiliate_url":"https://uncovercreations.com?sca_ref=7274693.yRvAAew6TQ","rating":4,"siteOrder":19,"price":"free","tags":[],"features":[],"categories":[{"id":"best-adult-online-shops","collection":"categories_en"}],"screenshot_url":"https://cdn.staticstack.net/assets/img/r-thumbs/2637eb9-uncovercreations_small.png","image_alt":"Uncover Creations, Sex Toy Store","scraped_at":"2025-10-28T18:03:41.733Z","iconSpritesheet":"custom-favicon-spritesheet.png","iconPosition":"-272px -848px","iconClassName":"ctm-icon18224","logoIconClass":"icon18224","pros":["high-quality fantasy sex toys","custom made to order – lots of options","free gifts","free economy shipping over $80","incredible range of exotic fake dicks","awesome fantasy guy toys, too"],"cons":["shipping ain’t amazon fast"],"detailedDescription":"<p>You might want to keep the toys made by Uncover Creations covered up when family comes to visit, but aside from that, I think they look pretty cool up on the shelf. Sure, it’s a real aesthetic choice to keep a dragon dildo or a werewolf dick out where everybody can see it, but it adds a personal touch you’re just not going to get with a “Live, Laugh, Love” sign framed above the fireplace. Anyway, I think a lot of you would live, laugh and love even better with a lifelike alien ovipositor in your life. Now, who’s game for a gelatin egg up the butthole?</p><p></p><p>In case you haven’t connected the dots from my little intro, <strong>UncoverCreations.com is a maker of high-quality, custom fantasy sex toys</strong>. They’re one of just a few such manufacturers, making the kinds of freaky fake dongs and fuckable tentacles that you don’t find at the local sex shop just off the highway. These are some deep-niche products, but based on the website’s hundreds of thousands of monthly visitors, it looks like their demographic is having a blast. They were kind enough to hook your old pal MissAVDH up with a custom sci-fi dick-stroker, but you don’t have to be a world-renown masturbator to score a freebie. Read on and I’ll tell you all about it.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>For Fans of Horse Cock, By Fans of Horse Cock</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Speaking as a dude who spends his days surfing one-handed through the web’s best adult websites, I’ve found that you consistently get a better experience from any site that’s a labor of love. This is especially true in the deeper, kinkier niches, whether we’re talking about free fetish tubes or fantasy sex toys. Right from jump, Uncover Creations feels like it was made by real fans of these otherworldly doodads.</p><p></p><p>You’ll find that love reflected in not just the product designs, which they say typically start as some scribbles on their phones. <strong>They’re also making every custom sex toy to order</strong>. Every item in the catalog comes in a range of colors, firmness levels, and even sizes, and they hand-pour your request as soon as you order. The little card that came with mine said it was made by Matt, and they included a buy one, get one code on the back.</p><p></p><p>If you’ve ever been on an adult haunted house tour, you may have heard the phrase, “Fuck, there’s a horse cock in my room or a donkey dick!” I mention this because UncoverCreations included a free equine dildo called The Equiknot with my order. They’re not currently offering the same exact promo, but <strong>they are throwing in a free g-spot dildo with orders over $30</strong>. Thirty bones is what you might pay for a decent fake hog anyway, which helps put this killer deal into perspective.</p><p></p><p>What’s more, you get free economy shipping with orders over $80. I might be inclined to pay a few bucks for faster delivery speed, personally. Between the time it took for them to make my new custom toy and shipping from the UK, it took a couple weeks for my order to reach me. They say good things come to those who wait, an old adage which holds true here. The goods were so lovingly packed that I felt like I was opening something I ordered from Etsy versus some faceless corporation.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Perusing the Dildos at Uncover Creations</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Even without accounting for the insane customizations available, there are dozens of products on their Dildo page. That includes the knotted dongs of dragons and werewolves, tentacles in various shapes and sizes, alien butt plugs and a freaky swamp thing called The Geeyem. Add a suction cup for a few bucks and stick one of those bad boys on your headboard or shower wall.</p><p></p><p>I’m fascinated by the ovipositors and hope to get the opportunity to use one at some point. It might take some convincing with the girls of MissAVDHCasting, but I’d be able to live out some of my weirdest hentai fantasies. The silicone eggs they sell ain’t recommend for rectal use, but you can make them out of Jell-O for a treat even Bill Cosby would be thrilled with.</p><p></p><p>The elaborate grinders and cock rings at Uncover Creations look like Lovecraftian horrors favored by beloved whores. I’m talking masses of tentacles, imposing spikes, devil faces and eldritch abominations no man has so much as dreamed off--but they’ll get you off hard. Get a load of their “flower-inspired” Synstyl Grinder. To my eyes, it sure looks like a vagina, but one that would eat you back.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>But What Have They Got for the Straight Dudes?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>A lot of Uncover Creations’ toys are aimed squarely at couples, especially their range of made to measure penis extenders. Some of them are just normal-looking dicks that’ll give you the length you want, but they’ve also got alien penis sheaths, tentacle dick extenders, and ones with knots to explore your canine fantasies. You can hump your wife’s leg with it before doing it humanstyle.</p><p></p><p>And then there’s the toy that I ordered for myself. There’s currently only one male stroker available at UncoverCreations, but I’m hoping to see the selection expand. The Tentacle Masturbator has a base price of $55, though I did request some premium add-ons like a marbled two-tone glow-in-the-dark color and squishy-soft silicone firmness. The material is firmer than some of the sex toys I own from other manufacturers, but it is soft enough to turn the whole thing inside out for some new sensations.</p><p></p><p>It ain’t a complicated gadget, but man, it sure feels good. There’s some light texturing on the inside to help keep things interesting, and I felt like there was the perfect amount of give for finding your ideal intensity. Just slip it over your cock and give it a squeeze while you stroke. Since the top end is open, you can just throw a sock over it when you’re ready to make your deposit. Cleanup is much easier than trying to flush the cum out of a Fleshlight. Weirdly, it might even be a little more a little more inconspicuous, because everyone already knows a flashlight with a lid on it is getting fucked.</p><p></p><p>I really like UncoverCreations.com. I like their range of sexy, weird, highly customizable products; I like their polished website and their reasonable prices; and frankly, I just really like the company itself. You can tell these two friends got into the business of selling something they really love, and that means you’re probably going to love their toys, too. They’ve got a hell of a collection, and it seems like there’s new stuff available every time I check. If you’re in the market for a fake owlbear penis or something that can lay an egg in your cooter, you’d be a damn fool not to include this shop on your shortlist. These guys are awesome.</p>"}},{"id":"4866ef55b73e","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"4866ef55b73e","title":"Sohimi","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"Sohimi.com sells high-quality adult toys at super low prices and provides free delivery services for electronic dick massagers and cheap vibrators for less than 100 yuan.","canonical":"https://theporndude.com/zh/19199/sohimi","affiliate_url":"https://www.sohimi.com/?ref=yomoksrr&utm_source=affiliate","rating":4,"siteOrder":20,"price":"free","tags":["免费"],"features":[],"categories":[{"id":"best-adult-online-shops","collection":"categories_en"}],"screenshot_url":"https://cdn.staticstack.net/assets/img/r-thumbs/ad5ae34-sohimi_small.png","image_alt":"Sohimi, Sex Toy Store","scraped_at":"2025-10-28T18:03:49.288Z","iconSpritesheet":"custom-favicon-spritesheet.png","iconPosition":"-64px -880px","iconClassName":"ctm-icon19199","logoIconClass":"icon19199","pros":["sex toys for men, women and couples","warehouses in us, germany and japan","free shipping on orders over $99 (germany and usa only)","really nice prices","great selection of electronics","decent range of sex doll torsos","customer reviews"],"cons":["meager bdsm section","no lube aisle"],"detailedDescription":"<p>The motto beneath the Sohimi logo on their website encourages visitors to choose love and choose fun, both of which echo the kind of sentiments I like to offer here at MissAVDH. Their whole shop is stuffed full of gizmos and gadgets designed with both love and fun in mind, and they work just as well with a partner as they do in your intimate alone time. Whether you like to go at it solo or in groups, to dirty movies or your own mental fantasies, you’ll find plenty to stimulate those sensitive parts of yours.</p><p></p><p><strong>Sohimi.com sells adult toys for men, women and horny couples</strong>. The brand’s been around since 2006, though their e-commerce business didn’t kick off until a few years later. The website has since grown into an internationally respected toy store, with hundreds of thousands of customers and window shoppers stopping by every month. I feel like I’m something of a maestro when it comes to pleasuring myself manually, but I still love a nice, modern synthetic fuck hole with all the bells and whistles. Let’s take a closer look at the Sohimi catalog and see what they’re hawking.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>High-End Sex Toys with Low-Ass Prices</h3><p></p><p></p><p>It looks like the American warehouse is well stocked, because most of the products I clicked on could be delivered to me in just 3-5 days. In any case, <strong>shipping is free on orders over $99</strong>. The catch is that free shipping only applies to German and American orders, so you might be on the hook for a few bucks elsewhere. They do promise quick shipping around the world, though overseas delivery could take up to 20 days.</p><p></p><p>With a lot of internet sex toy shops, you can tell from the front page whether their clientele consists mainly of men or women. Most shops sell products for everyone, but the front-page spread of dildos or strokers tells you who’s buying. Sohimi is popular with both dudes and dudettes, as evidenced by the rows of top products this week. The current lineup includes automated dick massagers, dildos with licking lips, app-controlled sucking mouths and a thrusting vibrator with a beautifully engineered, multi-hinged suction-cup base.</p><p></p><p>That last item I mentioned seems to occupy a rare middle ground between regular-ass vibes and expensive robotic fuck machines. It’s an impressive gadget, and it’s on sale for just $65.99. Surprisingly affordable prices were a common theme, especially on the electronics.</p><p></p><p>That app-controlled mouth I mentioned is only $26, the dildo with the lips is under $40, and the battery-powered strokers on the front page start at just over $60. Electronic adult toys have come down considerably in recent years, and that’s certainly a factor here. Those who shop around, however, will immediately see the kind of value on offer.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Let’s Look at Those Dick Strokers</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Their shelf of Pocket Pussies was a lot smaller than I’d expected, though all the products look beautifully fuckable. They’ve focused on realistic simulations here, with models as low as $13. Sohimi doesn’t carry the biggest, most recognizable brands like Fleshlight or Tenga, which I think might actually work out for the consumer here. Instead of choosing between overpriced brand names and a thousand variations of basically the same thing, you’ve got a handful of realistic handheld vaginas, almost all of them running under $25.</p><p></p><p>I was more impressed by their catalog of Male Masturbators. There’s only one item among the current lineup that costs more than a hundo, but almost everything is electronic, with features like thrusting, spinning, sucking, vibrating, and more. It wasn’t long ago that every male masturbation toy with a battery would run you a couple Benjamins.</p><p></p><p>Sohimi’s even got their own branded luxury automatic masturbator, available for a penny under a hundred bucks. “This fully automatic airplane cup imitates the real deep-throat spiral gulp, with three layers of thickened design inside, make your penis never fall off,” reads the production description, putting to rest any fears your grandma may have put in your head about masturbation. It’s got multiple thrusting and rotating modes and “one-click erupt,” which sounds like it might be worth the entry fee.</p><p></p><p>For those in the market, I typically recommend one of the Sex Doll Shops off my big list here at MissAVDH versus buying from a big adult toy superstore. Sohimi.com might be an exception to this rule, at least if you’re looking for a partial lady. <strong>They’ve got a solid selection of sex doll torsos and synthetic asses</strong>. It’s not quite the spread you get from a specialist like Tantaly, but it's a lot more than the meager sex doll selection available from your average shop.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>A Pair of Handcuffs and Fake Dicks Galore</h3><p></p><p></p><p>If you’ve got more general female interests, though, wait till you get to the Vibrators aisle. It’s an even better selection than the automated dick machines, with buzzing stimulators in damn near every size, shape, and color imaginable. Again, the prices are considerably lower than I expect for anything that you can control with an app and get yourself off with. If you’ve been curious about those rose vibrators that have grown popular in recent years, now’s your chance to score one for less than you paid for lunch today.</p><p></p><p>I feel like Sohimi.com’s selection of dildos strikes a nice balance: there’s a great selection, but they don’t overwhelm customers with too many variations of basically the same thing. They’ve got realistic peckers, vibrating obelisks, and even some fantasy dongs for the kinkier folks out there. Have you ever seen a ghost pop out of the wall and say, “Fuck, there’s a horse cock in my room or a donkey dick”? Well, now you can finally give those little fuckers a reason.</p><p></p><p>I clicked through for a closer look at the Sohimi ALPHA Sucking and Thrusting G-Spot Vibrator Dildo Plug. It’s only $32.99, down from almost $80, and has no fewer than 450 combinations of vibrations. <strong>Customers can leave reviews on the website</strong>, which is how I know this one’s a big hit. I love that users can even leave pics, because I’ve found these kinds of reviews to be more reliably real than your average faceless internet writeup.</p><p></p><p>You know what’s really weird, though? I couldn’t find a lube aisle anywhere on the Sohimi website. As much natural lubricant as some of you folks are whipping up with your bodies alone, most of the products on the menu could use a little extra sauce to get them all slopped up. I figured I’d find the fluids in the Accessories section, but nah, I just found masturbation sleeves, lacy pajamas and USB cables. You’re going to have to buy your barrels of water-based synthetic precum and pussy juice somewhere else.</p><p></p><p>Sohimi.com might not have had every product I was looking for, but they’ve got a killer selection of masturbatory implements for everyone, at some of the best prices I’ve ever seen. Instead of stocking the major brands with the kind of high price tags you’d expect, they’ve focused on building a catalog of toys that are both high quality and affordable. They’re running an end-of-the-year sale as I type this up, but even if you miss it, I’m sure there are more deals coming.</p>"}},{"id":"efb8b75f3b45","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"efb8b75f3b45","title":"Anime Dakimakura Pillow","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"AnimeDakimakuraPillow.com is one of the leading Valkyrie pillow manufacturers and a large number of Japanese adult toy catalogs for retailers products including Onacon Valkyrie pillows and more","canonical":"https://theporndude.com/zh/17986/animedakimakurapillow","affiliate_url":"https://animedakimakurapillow.com/?ref=ADP-PORNDUDE","rating":4,"siteOrder":21,"price":"free","tags":[],"features":[],"categories":[{"id":"best-adult-online-shops","collection":"categories_en"},{"id":"best-premium-hentai-sites","collection":"categories_en"}],"screenshot_url":"https://cdn.staticstack.net/assets/img/r-thumbs/38b27d7-animedakimakurapillow_small.png","image_alt":"Anime Dakimakura Pillow, Sex Toy Store","scraped_at":"2025-10-28T18:03:57.268Z","iconSpritesheet":"custom-favicon-spritesheet.png","iconPosition":"-304px -832px","iconClassName":"ctm-icon17986","logoIconClass":"icon17986","pros":["anime body pillows and japanese adult toys","50,000+ anime waifus","popular anime characters, sfw and nsfw","fantastic selection of onaholes","free shipping around the world (minimum purchase required)","30-day money back guarantee"],"cons":["longer ship times than amazon"],"detailedDescription":"<p>You can probably guess at least some of what Anime Dakimakura Pillow sells. I mean, it is right there in the name, though you might not recognize the terminology if you’re not something of an otaku nerd. Yes, we’re talking about those big-ass body pillows printed with cute anime chicks, wolf girls and naked Genshin Impact characters, but that ain’t all the shop carries. Even if you think having a cushiony waifu on your bed is a step too far into neckbeardism, you might appreciate some of their more intimate products.</p><p></p><p>Would you believe me if I said I just got head from an anime vampire girl? Because I did, and AnimeDakimakuraPillow.com made it happen. <strong>The shop carries a wide assortment of anime body pillows and Japanese adult toys</strong>, which they’ve been shipping around the world for a couple decades now. Their website gets well over a hundred thousand visitors a month, and that’s not even counting their customers who buy the company’s goods elsewhere. I’m pretty much always looking for something new to stick my dick into when I’m not banging human women on MissAVDHCasting couch, so let’s take a closer look at that catalog, shall we?</p><p></p><p></p><h3>From Daki Fans to Daki Makers</h3><p></p><p></p><p>They’ve since grown into a manufacturer and wholesaler of legit Japanese dakimakura. There’s an attention to detail that you’re just not going to get with some off-brand bullshit on Amazon. They import fabric from Osaka for authenticity, do bulk orders for anime studios, and have a five-step quality control process to ensure a top-shelf product. I also love how vocal they are about supporting their artists, who really elevate those waifu pillows to the next level.</p><p></p><p>The front page of AnimeDakimakuraPillow.com loudly boasts that they’ve got over 50,000 anime waifus in the catalog. Looking a little bit closer, that actually includes a lot of the non-pillow products I’ll be getting into in a minute, but the selection does lean heavily toward what it says on the tin. If you’re looking for a big-eyed babe printed on something soft you can cuddle up with, you’ve come to the right place.</p><p></p><p>There are tons of popular characters, both SFW and NSFW. As I type this up, the top wholesome chicks hail from franchises FateGrand Order and Doki Doki Literature club, while the top pillows for pervs include explicit images of gals from Genshin Impact and How Not to Summon a Demon Lord. Most Anime Dakimakura Pillows run between fifty bucks and a hundo, depending on what size and material options you choose.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>More Than Just Anime Dakimakura Pillows</h3><p></p><p></p><p><strong>These guys have one of the best selections of onaholes you’re going to find outside of Japan</strong>. For the uninitiated, onaholes are the Japanese equivalent of fap sleeves, pocket pussies and Fleshlights, and they come in a crazy range of shapes, sizes, colors and styles. If you’re overwhelmed by the selection in the local porn shop that smells funny, you might want to set some time aside to peruse the selection.</p><p></p><p>I do appreciate how well they’ve organized the catalog, tagging every product with so much detail it puts the average sex toy shop to shame. You can browse onaholes by intensity: Gentle, Excite or Hardcore. There’s also a whole menu of themes, each leading to a full aisle of toys with hentai-oriented gimmicks like ahegao faces, futanari cocks, pantyhouse, paizuri, monsters and virgins. In case you were wondering, yes, they do have a tentacle section, as gropy as you were hoping for.</p><p></p><p>The onaholes in the Gentle category at AnimeDakimakuraPillow.com include some of the smaller, more affordable toys in the catalog. There’s a $30 Cowbell Cumblast bottle-shaped onahole, and a tiny little, headless and fucakble half-body for forty bones. At the other end of the spectrum, their Hardcore onaholes include vibrating fake asses for $80 and much bigger fuck torsos going for two or three bills.</p><p></p><p>AnimeDakimakuraPillow also carries the expected accessories, though in wholly unexpected varieties. Seriously, check out that lube aisle if you thought all the slippery stuff was the same. The regular-ass water-based lubricant here is all branded with sexy anime chicks, and they’ve also got creamy cum lube, icy lube, and a variety pack of scented lubes. Personally, I might have to add that Hot Demon Saliva to my cart. I think it’d go great with the toy they sent me.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>About That Cock-Sucking Vampire Girl…</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Fortunately, the teeth weren’t as hard or shop as you’d expect from a genuine creature of the night. Combined with the tongue, the tight, textured channel and the lifelike softness, it felt a hell of a lot like getting a real beej from a real woman who really knows what she’s doing. I can see why it’s a best seller.</p><p></p><p>One of my favorite things about Japanese sex toys is the packaging. My vampire onahole came in a colorful box covered in hentai imagery, which is a pretty standard experience with most of the products they’re carrying. I can only read the English parts of the box, but that’s always been part of the charm. I’m tempted to put the thing on my shelf, but I know my guests are going to want to know more about the naked manga chick on the front. “That’s my waifu, asshole!”</p><p></p><p>Remember what I said about AnimeDakimakuraPillow being fans of their own products? Speaking as a hentai nerd, I felt like I was in good company throughout my experience with the website and with the jiggly thing they sent me. It really seems like they got into this to make better products available to more weeaboos at more affordable prices. You don’t need a personal friend in Japan to get these kind of hookups anymore.</p><p></p><p><strong>Shipping is free around the world as long as you spend at least a hundred bucks (USD)</strong>, though it’s probably not going to be Amazon fast. Those pillows are custom made as soon as you order them, but you might be waiting a couple weeks for your new onahole, too. Express shipping can bump it up a week, but you can only cross the ocean so fast. Anyway, great things come to those who wait.</p><p></p><p><strong>There’s even a 30-day money-back guarantee</strong>, though it’s got the usual caveats for sex toys. Nobody wants anything you’ve already violated, as your mom tried to explain when you ruined Thanksgiving. You’re not going to pay for a fucked-up anime body pillow, though.</p><p></p><p>It's kind of a no-brainer to check out AnimeDakimakuraPillow.com if you’re in the market for one of those pillows, as they’re one of the world’s leading manufacturers of high-quality daki, with tons of characters and customization options. I’d also recommend a look if you’re a hentai fan or just looking for a new sex toy. They might have the best selection of onaholes I’ve ever seen, offering thousands of ways to get yourself with an anime theme. For those looking for the best of both worlds, don’t miss out on their onahole/dakimakura combos. It’s time to take your pillow humping to the next level.</p>"}},{"id":"453e589e3750","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"453e589e3750","title":"Roussan","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"Roussan.net is a sex machine company with more than a decade of history to provide you with quirky products from classic sex machines to BDSM and wearable sex machines","canonical":"https://theporndude.com/zh/18797/roussan","affiliate_url":"https://roussan.net?ta_aff=17PCMDWOCZ","rating":4,"siteOrder":22,"price":"free","tags":[],"features":[],"categories":[{"id":"best-adult-online-shops","collection":"categories_en"}],"screenshot_url":"https://cdn.staticstack.net/assets/img/r-thumbs/9655560-roussan_small.png","image_alt":"Roussan, sex toy store","scraped_at":"2025-10-28T18:04:04.417Z","iconSpritesheet":"custom-favicon-spritesheet.png","iconPosition":"-224px -864px","iconClassName":"ctm-icon18797","logoIconClass":"icon18797","pros":["a unique sex toy firm that brings some downright unique fucking machines to the table","the site’s theme is pretty sleek overall, and it’s easy to use and find your way around","roussan is a well-established brand that has been running for over eleven years"],"cons":["there’s a need for more sex machine product videos on the site","despite being over a decade old, the site doesn’t have a sex machine blog in place"],"detailedDescription":"<p>Picture the scene: you’ve been waiting for a night out for months, and the day is finally upon you.

That’s where I’ve decided to step in and start reviewing each and every one of them to bring you clit-deep into the kind of fucking machines that will leave a mark while helping you avoid those that will go up in a cloud of smoke after a few intense sessions. Now, let’s see where today’s sex machine firm, Roussan.net, will bring us!</p><p></p><p></p><h3>What is Roussan.net?</h3><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>What Kind of Sex Machines Does Roussan.net Bring to the Table?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Roussan.net has brought some downright quirky fucking machines to their horny clients that have arguably revolutionized everything from remote-controlled sex to extreme BDSM sessions. Now, let me show you what I mean as I introduce you to some of the brand’s most popular products!</p><p></p><p>1. Roussan’s Wearable Sex Machine - Have you ever been balls-deep on the end of a static fucking machine and suddenly had to run out on an unexpected errand? Obviously, you don’t want the remote-controlled fucking experience to end, but you can't precisely drag the entire machine to the store with you, right? Well, with the innovative wearable fucking machine that Roussan.net have invented, you sure as shit can! This shit is wild and consists of a sturdy belt locking the sex machine’s gearbox just above your ass and leaves the affixed dildo hanging down with a robotic arm, allowing you to take a stroll and get your ass or pussy pounded at the same time. The future is now!</p><p>2. The Slave’s Sex Machine Bench - If you’re a BDSM Dom with an unruly sub whose pussy or ass demands attention around the clock, then you’re going to love this naughty little machine from Roussan.net. It’s built in the style of a Queening stool, allowing your sub to straddle its red leather exterior and spread their legs wide. However, unlike a Queening stool, there’s no tongue lying in wait below to lap their holes. Instead, they get a robotic fucking from a powerful dildo that pistons in from underneath. Lock a sub to this fucker, and let the relentless fucking machine do its thing until they gush all over it, and you’ll be hearing that safeword shouted out as they struggle to withstand orgasm after orgasm!</p><p>3. The Roussan.net Flagship Sex Machine - And, of course, aside from all of the quirky sex machines that Roussan.net brings to the table, they naturally have the tried and tested classic design that is designed to be a static fixture of your bedroom and can fuck your holes for hours on end until you can’t take it anymore. Interestingly, though, there are a few different variants, and one I liked the look of in particular was a double-ended machine that lets two people enjoy it at once. If you’re a horny couple, you could affix a dildo on one end and a Fleshlight on the other to pump cock and cunt at the same time. How cool does that sound?</p><p></p><p></p><h3>The Design of the Store</h3><p></p><p></p><p>The store has gone for a dark theme. It begins with a black header bar that hosts a well-designed white logo that’s the same color as the lube drenching a lot of the brand’s sex toys and the main menu that takes you to the homepage, a catalog of sex machines, an About page, affiliate landing page, and a contact page.</p><p></p><p>Roussan.net’s homepage starts with an eye-catching hero image showcasing the brand’s flagship sex machine and some easy-to-read text summing up what their remote-controlled sex machine tech is all about. There’s also a link leading to the site’s catalog here, too.</p><p></p><p>Below this, you’ll see a scrollable selection of some of Roussan.net’s most popular machines for you to explore, followed by a CTA section showcasing what the sex machine’s app is capable of. Through the use of two QR codes, Roussan.net then invites you to download the app for yourself and test it out. Then, the homepage rounds off with some positive testimonials from happy clients.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>What I Like Most About It</h3><p></p><p></p><p>The store is also pretty well-designed, too. I found Roussan.net was rocking a simple theme, and it was really easy to find your way around. While a lot of sex toy brands tend to launch an overwhelming homepage that has way too much content on it, Roussan.net has kept it sleek and simple.</p><p></p><p>Roussan.net also isn’t a fly-by-night kind of sex machine brand. They've been in the business of fucking machines for over a decade and haven’t made the mistake of spreading themselves too thin and branching out into non-linked sex toy niches. They know their product and they know it well.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>What I Don’t Like</h3><p></p><p></p><p>And while sex machines have been around for a while now, there are a lot of folks who are only just finding out about them. Naturally, this means that there’s a lot of demand from people keen to uncover a lot of cool tips and tricks on buying the right one and getting the most out of it. So, I was surprised to see that Roussan.net didn’t have a blog in place after eleven years in business.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Suggestions I Have For Roussan.net</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Running alongside said videos, Roussan.net could also benefit a lot from some well-written sex machine blogs that cover all of the coolest elements of the niche. Not only will this do wonders for sales conversions, but it’ll also be a solid benefit for the store’s front-end SEO. A site that is this well-established should have had a blog put together by now.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p></p><p></p><p>However, even a site as well-established as this one can have flaws, and Roussan.net could be improved with some detailed sex machine videos in place alongside well-written blogs covering tips and advice for people just discovering the world of fucking machines.</p>"}},{"id":"0f3af3bf0dcb","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"0f3af3bf0dcb","title":"MUF","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"Muf.com focuses on high quality premium sex toys This is not found in local porn stores.

I’m not just talking about the polished, professional presentation or the extensive catalog of adult goods they’re hawking, but the domain itself. Three-letter dot coms haven’t been available for decades, but these guys have been around since the earliest of aughts. Longevity counts for a lot on a fickle internet, but as we’ll see, these guys ain’t thriving on legacy alone.</p><p></p><p>Muf.com, formerly known as Melrose Urban Female, is <strong>an online boutique sex shop catering to men, women and couples</strong>. Their main gimmick, if you want to call it that, is truly premium adult toys, the stuff that would be on the top shelf of your local porn store if they even carried products of this quality. Just perusing the website made me feel like a bum for busting a nut into a crusty old gym sock this morning, so let’s see what they’ve got available to upgrade my future fap sessions.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Premium Goods for Boutique Sex Toy Shoppers</h3><p></p><p></p><p>“First of all, we are not a mega store,” they write, going on to describe Muf.com as a “boutique” store inspired by a Sex in the City attitude toward sex. The late ‘90s reference kind of gives away the store’s vintage, but still holds true, as do promises to hook their customers up. “If you are looking for something we do not have, please do not be shy. Ask, and you shall receive 99% of the time.”</p><p></p><p>The row of Featured Products on the front page as I type this up reflects that “boutique” qualification. They’re colorful, futuristic and beautifully designed, but they sure as hell ain’t the cheapest vibrators I’ve seen on the market lately. Muf does focus on some of the nicer toys out there, and the prices reflect that, but they’ve still got plenty of products for masturbators and sex-havers on a budget. They’ve got both dildos and pocket pussies starting at under $15. If you’re looking to spend more on something fancier, you can definitely do that, too!</p><p></p><p>In either case, they offer free, discreet shipping. You’ve got to spend at least $50 to qualify, but that won’t be a problem for most orders. It’s not necessarily Amazon fast, but they process and ship everything the same day if you get you order in before 2 PM Eastern. Smaller shops seem to be kind of hit or miss in this respect, and I really appreciate that it’s not an upcharge just to get your package out in a timely manner.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>What Kind of Fake Dick You Looking For?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Since Muf began as an all-female company, Melrose Urban Female, I decided to check out their girly toys first. I ran into a little glitch where I couldn’t pull up the full list of vibrators in every category, but given the massive selection, perhaps it’s easier to peruse the type you’re most interested in. That includes 80 air pressure and suction vibes, 62 thrusting vibrators, 33 dual penetrating toys, and no fewer than 263 buzzing clitoral stimulators. They’ve got 19 different subcategories of vibrators alone, including Finger Vibrators, Luxury Vibrators, App Controlled and Remotes Vibes, and a lot more.</p><p></p><p>The spread of dildos is similarly varied, with aisles of glass dicks, harness-compatible shlongs, realistic fake cocks, packers and non-phallic dildos. One of the best-selling units under the Large Dildo category is big, veiny number with a syringe for squirting the included Nut Butter all over your own face or your partner’s. It’s only $76 and comes in an assortment of colors, so you can build yourself a little rainbow of ejaculating penii. Perhaps some food coloring is in order for the sperm, huh?</p><p></p><p>Muf.com also has a Women section separate from their selections of simulated hogs, where you can find hundreds of oral sex toys, clitoral pumps, nipple arousers, Kegel balls and more. I was excited to find a subsection of Pheromones and Attractants, but they didn’t have anything in stock during my visit. I’m still not 100% sold on the concept, though I feel like I need to do more personal experiments. I’ll have to watch that shelf.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>A Variety of Tight, Fleshy, Synthetic Holes</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Sometimes dildo shops leave the dudes hanging, but there are currently around 500 products at Muf.com aimed at the gentlemen in the audience, not to mention the depraved perverts. The first page of their male-oriented Best Sellers right now consists almost entirely of penis extenders, along with a $45 beginner’s strap-on, which I think says a lot about the demographics shopping here.</p><p></p><p>I’m always looking for things to stick my dick into, so I next made my way to their selection of over 200 Masturbation Devices for men. Electronic doodads have really been coming down in price lately, and I was pleased to find some really affordable ones along with the high-end dick strokers I expected. They’ve got buzzing fake cooters starting at $36, or you can spend a good four hundo on what might be the most futuristic automated blowjob machine I’ve ever seen. The VeDO Hummer 2.0 is capable of speeds of “180 suction impulses per minute.” I’m not even sure my thirstiest guests at MissAVDHCasting can suck like that.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>And For the Home Dungeon</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Muf’s got a great selection of bondage gear, too, but I almost didn’t see it because my window wasn’t wide enough, hiding the header link. Whether you’re looking to do some Fifty Shades roleplaying or something even harder, they’ve got you covered. Literally in some cases, as they’ve got a ton of soft, comfortable blindfolds. You wouldn’t want to hurt your lover’s delicate face as you’re beating his balls with a rubber flogger, tightening his nipple clamps and shoving a cold metal plug up his poop chute.</p><p></p><p>Muf.com prides itself on being more than just a sex toy superstore, but that doesn’t mean a poor selection of overpriced synthetic sausage. Their curated toybox is chock full of some of the nicest adult products you’ll find anywhere in the world, with enough variety to cater to damn near anything you freaky folks are doing when nobody else is watching. If you’re looking for something better than the off-brand, potentially toxic fake dicks and pocket pussies they sell elsewhere, this is the place. Don’t let the “boutique” status scare you—they’ve got toys for all budgets!</p>"}},{"id":"cf4e9a7f200f","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"cf4e9a7f200f","title":"Juliet Toys","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"JulietToys.com is a historic fantasy sex toy brand that provides you with many eye-opening ripped dildos that many people have never seen before","canonical":"https://theporndude.com/zh/20654/juliettoys","affiliate_url":"https://www.juliettoys.com/?ref=zbenuery","rating":4,"siteOrder":24,"price":"free","tags":[],"features":[],"categories":[{"id":"best-adult-online-shops","collection":"categories_en"}],"screenshot_url":"https://cdn.staticstack.net/assets/img/r-thumbs/9928660-juliettoys_small.png","image_alt":"Juliet Toys, Sex Toys Store","scraped_at":"2025-10-28T18:04:26.955Z","iconSpritesheet":"custom-favicon-spritesheet.png","iconPosition":"-64px -912px","iconClassName":"ctm-icon20654","logoIconClass":"icon20654","pros":["a genuinely quirky brand that brings some downright unique fantasy dildos to the table","the best-seller toy section is a great way to get to the meat and potatoes of the catalog","the string of xxx influencers posing with the brand’s toys is a solid marketing coup"],"cons":["the main menu is a little busy and can be overwhelming on arrival for some people"],"detailedDescription":"<p>Do you remember the days when people used to laugh and giggle at the idea of a woman owning a vibrator or a plain ol’ dildo? You'd often see those viral photos being posted online of chicks taking selfies, utterly unaware that they had a 6-in rubber cock on the shelf behind them, and it was the kind of shit that everyone used to laugh at.</p><p></p><p>These days though, the reality is that more and more people are seeking out the kind of sex stories that, if you were to accidentally stumble across them while cleaning up a woman's bedroom, it would probably leave you traumatized and with your eyes going wider than her asshole is after she's had a 6-hour session riding it balls deep.</p><p></p><p>You see, while your average six-inch dildo based on a real man's dick scratched the sexual itch many people had for years, it soon became clear that the human race was demanding more and more excitement, and this led to the advent of fantasy dildos. And since this perverted train left the station, it's safe to say that it doesn't seem to be stopping anytime soon.</p><p></p><p>But what if you're one of the many people out there who are keen to get your hands on the next level of sex toys and throw yourself down the rabbit hole of fantasy dildos and sci-fi pleasure gadgets? Naturally, it's a good idea to find a reliable store because, after all, these toys will be pushing your holes to the absolute limits. Today, it's time for me to bring you into one of the fantasy sex toy manufacturers that has been on everyone's lips for a while. Now, get ready to meet Juliettoys.com!</p><p></p><p></p><h3>What is Juliettoys.com?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>From horse cock dildos and alien egg-inserting sex toys to extreme anal beads and lifelike dildos that are capable of ejaculating inside of you and giving you an artificial creampie, it's safe to say that Juliettoys.com definitely isn't missing out on any of the weirdest and wonderful sex toy kinks that are currently out there.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>What Fantasy Sex Toys Can You Find on Juliettoys.com?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>● The Hunter Jack Ejaculating Dildo - We’re jumping off into the deep end here as we kick off this list with one of Juliettoys.com’s best-selling sex toys. This is a gorgeously colored black and gray monster dildo that is based on a horse cock, and it's seriously not one for the faint-hearted. Instead, this is the kind of gigantic dildo that is reserved for people who like deep penetration and their whole being stretched out to the absolute limits. But the magic doesn't end there, either, because this is an ejaculating dildo that can be filled with as much fake sperm as you like, complete with a function that allows you to spray your ass or pussy with artificial jizz and live out your wildest creampie fantasies at the push of a button.</p><p>● The Maya Ovipositor Dildo - Have you ever dreamed of being abducted by an alien master race, tied up, and feeling their extraterrestrial dick slide into you before pumping you with as many eggs as your stomach can carry? Of course, you have, you dirty fucker! Well, rather than going into your local crop circle and waiting to be sucked up into a UFO, you can make it happen whenever you want with this wild pneumatic dildo that can not only do a total number on your whole and stretch it out beyond all recognition but can also pump artificial alien eggs deep inside of you for you to live out those extra-terrestrial sex fantasies you've always harbored. This is seriously a wild toy!</p><p>● The SWISOK Aphrodite Sex Grinder - And last but not least, we have this downright quirky sex toy from Juliettoys.com that looks like something you'd see clinging to the wall of an alien-infested cave somewhere in outer space. Rather than the conventional dildos and anal toys you often find in this store, this toy is what is known as a sex grinder. It’s built primarily for women to squat over and rub their pussy for hours on end, giving them the kind of external orgasms that can be truly mind-blowing. While it doesn't offer much in the way of penetration, the bumps and ridges of this sex toy grinder can bury themselves into the folds of a woman's slit until she drenches it in her hot juices, all while reveling in the sci-fi fantasy aspect of it all.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>The Design of the Store</h3><p></p><p>This fantasy sex toy store begins with a jet-black header bar where you will find a stylish white and red logo spelling out the initials with a forked tail. There's also a giant menu up here that takes you to everything from featured products, lubricants, and brands to the best-selling toys, vibrators, and those currently on clearance.</p><p></p><p>Juliettoys.com’s homepage starts with a gorgeously designed slideshow that showcases some of the latest fantasy sex toys on offer, often photographed via stylish and professional-looking photoshoots. Underneath this, you'll see a scrollable menu of the site's main fantasy sex story categories ranging from realistic and fantasy dildos to anal beads and ejaculating sex toys that can deliver an artificial creampie.</p><p></p><p>As you get to the lower half of the site's homepage, you'll see a portfolio of the best-selling sex toys, a gallery of some of the site's quirkiest sex toy functions such as ovipositor and ejaculating dildos, featured collections previews of the latest blog articles and a selection of influencers posing with some of the store’s most standout sex toys.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>What I Like Most About it</h3><p></p><p></p><p>The sex toy collection on Juliettoys.com is now so damn big that there's a serious risk of it being overwhelming as fuck for new arrivals. That's why I love that Juliettoys.com has added a bestseller section that introduces you to the kind of kinky toys and quirky gadgets that people seem to be buying the most and enjoying to the fullest.</p><p></p><p>Another marketing coup that Juliettoys.com has pulled off gorgeously is the selection of well-known adult influences posing with the toys. You can find everything from chastity cage-wearing men riding gut-busting alien cocks to busty 19-year-olds who are keen to show you that they can fit 20 inches of an alien tentacle dildo deep in their sweet, pink pussy.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>What I Don’t Like</h3><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Suggestions I Have for Juliettoys.com</h3><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p></p><p></p><p>If, on the other hand, you're a sexually liberated veteran of filth who is keen to live out some of their wildest XXX dreams and undergo everything from artificial insemination to being pumped with alien eggs while you explode with squirt, then you genuinely can't go wrong with a store like Juliettoys.com.</p>"}},{"id":"e1b08b3443fe","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"e1b08b3443fe","title":"Domlust","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"Domlust.com is an XXX store and it is sure to bring you some of the most exotic boundaries-breaking fantasy sex toys you've never seen before","canonical":"https://theporndude.com/zh/21523/domlust-review","affiliate_url":"https://www.domlust.com/?dt_id=2419880","rating":4,"siteOrder":25,"price":"free","tags":[],"features":[],"categories":[{"id":"best-adult-online-shops","collection":"categories_en"}],"screenshot_url":"https://cdn.staticstack.net/assets/img/r-thumbs/f04cb89-domlust-review_small.png","image_alt":"Domlust, Sex Toy Store","scraped_at":"2025-10-28T18:04:37.493Z","iconSpritesheet":"custom-favicon-spritesheet.png","iconPosition":"-240px -928px","iconClassName":"ctm-icon21523","logoIconClass":"icon21523","pros":["a quirky sex toy brand that definitely delivers on its promises of unique xxx products","the overall design of the site is kept simple, and navigating it is really smooth","you'll find a lot of useful blog articles and how-to pieces on the site's blog"],"cons":["the about page is a letdown and an underrated opportunity to underline the brand"],"detailedDescription":"<p>It seems like only yesterday when people like us were being ingenious as fuck about weird and wonderful ways to up our wanking game, doesn’t it?

I’ve heard the stories, and I know that chicks can often be ten times worse than horny dudes when they’re looking for makeshift sex toys. Whether it’s a long-handled hairbrush, the thundering water out of the head of the shower, or the arm of a couch, I’ve heard of bitches grinding out an orgasm anytime, anywhere!</p><p></p><p>It all seems even wilder when we take a look at some of the sex toys on offer these days and realize that, at the click of a button, we can have the kind of gadgets that we once thought our filthiest dreams were made of. However, as time has gone by, even your most high-tech XXX toys have become dull to some, and there's been a hefty crowd of pleasure connoisseurs out there who have been on the hunt for some seriously out-there sex toys that will make your eyes go wide as fuck!</p><p></p><p>And you all know me by now. I will stop at nothing to cover all of the kinkiest sides of the sex toy game, regardless of how out there and taboo it might seem. Today's review is going to be a prime example because it's time for me to introduce you to the underrated world of Domlust.com. Trust me, I genuinely don't think you've seen toys like this before!</p><p></p><p></p><h3>What is Domlust.com?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>You see, a lot of the toys on Domlust.com are all based around the kind of things that you definitely won't find in your average adult store. You can find everything from animal-shaped buttholes to octopus masturbators and furry-themed pleasure devices and the kinky-themed lube to go with it!</p><p></p><p></p><h3>What Quirky Fantasy Sex Toys Does Domlust.com Have In-Store?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>● The Horse-Themed Pocket Pussy - Although it comes at you with the kind of love holes that look as though they are situated between the legs of a 70-year-old hooker who gives rides for $10 a pop, this sex toy is actually based on a mold of a horse-themed vagina. It offers not one but two glorious love holes for you to stick your quirky dick into all night long. If you're into the whole vibe of fantasy sex toys, then this is like a dream come true because it's genuinely a work of art and molded in all of the right ways to make you appreciate it for hours on end just by looking at it, not to mention slamming your dick into it at full force.</p><p>● The Horse Cock Penis Sleeve - What do you do if, one night, you're sitting there with your beloved other half, and she says something to you like, ‘’I wish you had a dick that's the same size as a horse cock!’’ Some people might get a bit offended and somewhat upset that she isn't happy with the human size of their cock. Other people, though, will likely hop onto a sex store’s website like Domlust.com and go looking for a lifelike penis sleeve that they can slip over their knob and can transform into one that is genuinely the same size and girth as that of a horse. This thing is hyper-realistic and is bound to unleash some very feral bedroom antics upon an open-minded lover, that's for sure!</p><p>● The Ejaculating Doggy Dick Dildo - And now we dive headfirst into the site’s dildo collection. What better way to kick things off with this dog-themed dildo that not only comes with an inflatable base that can literally tie the knot when it's balls deep inside of you but can also deliver an artificial creampie via some jizz-themed lube pumped inside of it via a discrete tube. This is a downright wild fantasy dildo that is not for the faint-hearted, but it's definitely one that can help you live out some of your most perverse fantasies in ways you previously could never have imagined. Man, it’s a brave new world out there!</p><p></p><p></p><h3>The Design of the Store</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Underneath this, you'll see the main menu with links to places like the top toy genres on offer, as well as some of the featured third-party brands they have in store. You'll also see a translation menu, a search bar, and a button to access your cart or login to your account on the site here.</p><p></p><p>This is then followed by a hero section to welcome you to the site, featuring a glorious image of an ebony goddess riding a brown horse. From there, a slideshow kicks off that introduces you to some of the brand's top-selling products via some gorgeously shot sex toy photography.</p><p></p><p>Domlust.com keeps the design of its homepage pretty simple and introduces you to various portfolios of its different toy categories, with calls to action highlighting the selling points the site has to offer. Each toy comes with a title and profile picture, as well as a price and how hot it is among other buyers. Towards the bottom of the site, you'll see handy FAQ, blog, and how-to sections, too.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>What I Like Most About it</h3><p></p><p></p><p>One thing I often hate when navigating through sex toy websites is when they keep the homepage far too busy than it needs to be, making navigation of the site a total pain in the ass. Thankfully, this is something that Domlust.com doesn't do, and it ensures that the homepage is a glorious experience to navigate from top to bottom, is kept free of advertisements, and runs as smoothly as I imagine some of these quirky animal-themed pocket pussies do when some horny dude has his dick balls deep inside of them.</p><p></p><p>And like any good sex toy website worth its salt, Domlust.com has taken the time and put in the effort to construct a decent array of blogs and how-to-use articles on its site. It's safe to say they can really bring some benefits to people who are just getting started in the world of high-tech fantasy sex toys like the ones on offer on this site.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>What I Don’t Like</h3><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Suggestions I Have for Domlust.com</h3><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p></p>"}},{"id":"eb0692cd283f","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"eb0692cd283f","title":"PornDudeShop","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"MissAVDHShop.com is the only website you can buy MissAVDH official peripherals you can buy T-shirts, mugs, pillows and more.

Is it unlicensed dildos modeled after my schlong, as seen on MissAVDHCasting? Perhaps it’s the proprietary blend of herbs, spices, and household chemicals I’ve been developing in my kitchen as an alternative to Viagra or a mass-produced version of the homemade hump machine I built out in the garage. Well, I’m sorry to break it to you folks, but my team of high-powered lawyers already vetoed most of those ideas. So what you’ll find instead is arguably a safer bunch of knickknacks and doodads, all emblazoned with the handsome mug you’ve come to love over the years: my own.</p><p></p><p>Yes, ladies and gentlemen and absolute perverts, <strong>MissAVDH Shop (dot com) is the one and only place to score officially licensed MissAVDH merch</strong>. I’d been thinking of launching a little shop for a while, and now seemed like the perfect time, especially with all the attention I’ve been getting lately over at MissAVDHCasting. In fact, if you’ve been watching and playing along at home, you may already recognize some of the gear I’m hawking. If not, hey, I’ve got some really great casting porn to tell you about. Whatever the case, even if it’s your very first time hearing about me and my various sexual endeavors, I bet I’ve got some shit that’ll make you look and feel like a million bucks. Let’s take a look.</p><p></p><h3>An Unbiased Look at My Awesomeness</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Sometimes, though, it’s definitely alright to toot your own horn. So if you’re just joining the party and missed the earlier festivities, allow me to humblebrag about all the world-class hotties I’ve been banging over on MissAVDHCasting couch as of late. In the past couple of weeks alone, I’ve smashed Gia Derza and Gianna Dior, two of the world’s most popular pornstars, who you’ve probably cranked off to before. I’ve also banged big names like Natasha Nice and Lauren Phillips and even gave legendary MILF Katie Morgan her first onscreen dick up the ass.</p><p></p><p>However, even before I was fucking my way through the world’s most beautiful women, I’d made a name for myself as the world’s preeminent porn reviewer. Some of you have been seeing me for years in your pornographic travels, on your way to new and fantastic celebrity nude blogs, sex cartoon collections, interracial anal sites, or whatever it is that gets you all hard and drippy. I get hit up regularly by different news outlets, from Hustler to Wired to MelMagazine, asking my scholarly opinion on all things pornographic.</p><p></p><p>My point is, I know I’m fucking awesome, and so do you. I wouldn’t have started MissAVDH Shop if you guys hadn’t been asking for years to have my face on a t-shirt. I’ve done even better, though. Instead of just giving you an opportunity to have a MissAVDH on your chest, <strong>MissAVDHShop carries a variety of licensed merch, from clothing to mugs to pillows, iPhone cases, and stickers</strong>. I’ve got some more things up my sleeve and in the works, too, but you’ll just have to keep stopping by to see.</p><p></p><h3>Rocking MissAVDH Gear All Day and All Night</h3><p></p><p></p><p>After you wake up, rub the sleep out of your eyes and the sperm out of your ding-dong, you can wash down your erectile enhancement pills with some coffee straight out of an official Dude Island Mug. That’s the same pervert paradise you see at the bottom of MissAVDH.com, and it looks pretty fucking sharp wrapped around your morning cup of Joe. There are also a few other mugs available from MissAVDH Shop, so you can enjoy my face with drinks at every meal. They also hold sperm well.</p><p></p><p>Once you’re adequately caffeinated and your dick is working at full capacity, it’s time to get dressed for the day. I’ve got half a dozen different MissAVDH t-shirt designs to choose from on MissAVDHShop.com, from the aforementioned MissAVDH Island to a few other MissAVDH poses to a simple yet classy logo across the titty area. And if it’s chilly where you live, you could always cop a hoodie with the same kickass graphics.</p><p></p><p>Oh, and don’t forget the socks! Wearing shoes without socks is a good way to get those Nikes smelling like a rancid gymnasium of the dead, but the official MissAVDH Emoji Socks will keep your feet fresh, clean, and dry just as long as you’re changing them daily like anyone with decent hygiene. These are literally the same exact socks I wear when I’m humping pornstars on MissAVDHCasting! I’m not saying you’ll be getting higher-caliber pussy if you start rocking these, but they’re definitely a few steps up from those off-brand Fruit-of-the-Loom knockoffs you bought off Wish.</p><p></p><p>You could also lug my image around with you everywhere you go with one of the phone cases I’ve got for sale in MissAVDH Shop. I’ve got them available for iPhones and Samsung Galaxies right now, but that could change. Well, if I don’t have one for your current phone, no worries because you could always buy an official MissAVDH sticker and use it to customize your flip phone or whatever. They also look good on Fleshlights, bongs, guitars, windowless vans, and pretty much anything else with a flat surface available for sticking.</p><p></p><h3>My Face to Your Door, Cheap!</h3><p></p><p></p><p>It’s also worth mentioning that the horny little elves who run <strong>MissAVDH Shop will ship the goods anywhere in the world</strong>. That may change in the future, but so far, we haven’t been banned or outlawed by any of the prudish countries who give me shit about MissAVDH. So unless something changes, you can order my socks, boxers, pillows, and everything else, no matter what corner of the globe you usually do your jerking off.</p><p></p><p>In the interest of trying to be unbiased, I did look for some shit to complain about as I perused MissAVDHShop.com for this review. And really, my only potential beef is that the selection could be a little wider. I mean, I don’t have those MissAVDH dildos available yet, but I have taken some casts of my cock, so we’ll see what happens with that. (The lawyers have given me a pretty solid “No” on the proprietary boner pills, rectal vodka syringes, and cock-stretching pulley systems, though.) Still, if there’s something you’d like to see available in MissAVDH Shop, hit me up, and I’ll see what I can do.</p><p></p><p>Some people think my job is just a few extra minutes of masturbation every day, but I’m a busy motherfucker. I barely have time for any recreational bishop flogging between reviewing new porn sites daily, shooting weekly videos for MissAVDHCasting, and designing merch for MissAVDHShop.com. It’s all worth it in the end because I know my fans are happy as they beat off to their favorite smut, the porno that I’ve helped them find or maybe even starred in. If you’ve ever wanted to throw some support back my way or just let the world know what amazing taste you have, imagine how good you’d look in some of this official gear.</p>"}},{"id":"28df661228f6","collection":"sites_en","data":{"slug":"28df661228f6","title":"HiSmith","lang":"en","date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"Hismith.co.uk is one of the world's leading suppliers of high-power sex machines.

While you may not immediately recognize the brand’s logo or the sound it makes when it rolls off your tongue, there’s a damn good chance you’ve beaten off to dirty movies featuring their products. Those videos are hot as hell, but why leave the fun on the other end of the internet? You can go to the source, get your own goodies, and get yourself off at home in ways you’ve only witnessed on the small screen and the even smaller one.</p><p></p><p>So, what the hell is your old pal MissAVDH talking about? <strong>Hismith.co.uk is a purveyor of high-quality, high-powered sex machines and other adult toys</strong>. These guys have been around since 2005, firmly establishing themselves at the top of the automated humping device game, and get a good 50,000 visitors a month. With a product like this, I’m genuinely curious how many are just window shopping, and how many really want to get plowed by a robot.</p><p></p><p>Some of you stateside perverts may have noticed the UK part of the domain name and wondered if you might get faster service from an American brand. Not to worry, my dudes, as Hismith has stock stashed worldwide and offers free shipping. That includes warehouses in the US, the UK and the EU, so you can expect your fancy new gear in a week or so. It ain’t Amazon Prime, but when’s the last time your wife got banged by something Bezos was hawking?</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Get On Up with Hismith</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Some of these units can get pricey, as you might imagine. That’s just the economics of specialty items of any kind. You can expect to pay a couple grand for one of their higher-end models, which ain’t exactly perfect for everybody’s budget. Professionals, the generally rich and hardcore enthusiasts may feel differently, but you might want to consult the wifey before pulling the trigger on the priciest auto-fucker.</p><p></p><p><strong>The good news is that Hismith.co.uk carries automated fucking machines starting at under a hundred bucks</strong>. That’s honestly a lot less than what I expected, especially with free shipping. Even the lower-end units are powerful, too: are you up for 450 RPM motor speeds and 180 strokes per minute? That’s entry level, my horny friends!</p><p></p><p>The unit I’m referencing is called the Auxfun Basic Automated Thrusting Sex Machine. It starts at $94, or there’s an app-controlled version for $124. For around $150, they offer a few sizable bundles with the Auxfun and a couple big handfuls of dildos. Are you looking for an anniversary gift? If not, maybe you can just start an OnlyFans or become a webcam model…</p><p></p><p>They’ve got a whole aisle of Affordable Sex Machines that won’t break the bank. They’re mostly variations on the same basic thrusting designs, and they’ve also got a couple high-tech masturbation cups if you’re looking for something to stick your dick into.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Stay on the Scene with a Premium Sex Machine</h3><p></p><p></p><p>At the lowest end of their Premium selections is the Hismith Table Top 2 48W, with a more powerful 100W version available for about $90 more. It’s app-controlled for long-distance loving, programmable and offers multiple control methods. The bright color options give it a festive vibe, like getting boned by a robot in a cartoon, but there’s also a black finish if you’d prefer something a little more understated. In this case, BBC stands for Black Barging Contraption.</p><p></p><p>Personally, when I think of fuck machines, I’m thinking of gadgets that look like the Hismith Servok, their ultra-premium $2000 model. The high price means it ain’t going to be the right unit for most consumers, but I do recommend watching the video on the product. It’s the most in-depth of any of the product videos I found on the Hismith website, and a lot of the demonstrated abilities can be found among the more affordable units.</p><p></p><p>While the Servok is the best of the best, that same style of machine can be had for about $500. They’ve got consistent features across the line, but it’s worth considering the wide assortment of attachments included with each of the different bundles. It's probably cheaper to splurge on a nice package now than grab up various fake dingdong attachments later.</p><p></p><p>Then again, who doesn’t love an upgrade? <strong>Hismith.co.uk has a wide selection of attachments to get mechanically fucked with</strong>. Prices are a little higher than typical dildos, but I don’t feel like they gouge their customers with overpriced proprietary bullshit. Basic but realistic cocks start at around $35, and even pricier options like fists and dragon dicks are still well under a hundo.</p><p></p><p>Most of the attachments are designed for penetrating orifices, which you probably expected based on that high-powered thrusting technology. They do have a handful of Fleshlight-style attachments for dudes, though. They’re a little cheaper than the name brand, and they’ve even got a vibrating one for a buck under $90. Honestly, those prices are solid for male masturbators, even if you ain’t planning on hooking it up to a big ol’ machine. There’s no shame in rubbing one out manually!</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Who Here Dreams of Getting Fucked by a Machine?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>As I type this up, they’ve got a number of premium sex machine bundles available for about $800 each, in different colors with different sets of dildos. They’re app powered, powerful, and have that heavy metal fuck-machine look I love.</p><p></p><p>It seems like customers are happy, too. <strong>There are review sections beneath every product listing</strong>, just like you should expect out of any legit ecommerce site. I do recommend carrying some healthy skepticism with you when it comes to any online reviews, but the ones I read at Hismith passed my sniff test. The company’s reputation around the world and across the internet tells me they ain’t bullshitting their customers.</p><p></p><p>If you do end up buying one of their sex machines, make sure to sign up for their newsletter for a discount code. It’s only 5%, which wouldn’t be a big deal on a cheapo fap sleeve, but that can save you a pretty penny when we’re talking about the household implement that’s going to ruin your marriage. (Just kidding! This might be exactly what you need to rekindle the old flame.)</p><p></p><p>Search any free tube for sex machines and you’re likely to find something you can buy at Hismith.co.uk. Over the last couple decades, they’ve established themselves as one of the leading purveyors of powerful pumping thrusters. Whether you use them for your pornographic endeavors or more personal encounters, you’ve got a wide range of options and a lower point of entry than I would have expected for such a niche device. Who wants to get humped by a machine?</p>"}}]
